Given the number of freshwater organisms especially fishes that have been introduced intentionally and unintentionally an urgent need exists for the development of toots for forecasting their spread. New Computational techniques partially overcome the defects of earlier environment matching methods including sensitivity to sparse and unbalanced data inflated statistical significance and asymmetrical (omission versus commission) errors. Here we apply one such method the genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) to predict spatial occurrences of suitable environments for two nonindigenous fishes that so far have limited distribution in North America Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocepholus cernuus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). For these two species we conclude that although spread is not inevitable their eventual range in North America will be considerable if management actions fait to prevent additional introductions. 1036:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A number of optimization models have been developed for natural reserve design and reserve site selection. The most common approach seeks to maximize the number of individual species that occur among chosen sites. A number of heuristics and mathematical programming algorithms have been applied to solve this problem. Although attaining maximum overall species representation is important the relative quality of representation which could be affected by site attributes such as habitat value adequate population size presence of critical resources existence (or lack thereof) of exotic competitors etc. has been absent from most representation models. Yet issues of site quality should be considered in order to have any assurance of long term species persistence in a reserve system. Here we present a multiobjective optimization model that addresses the issue of balancing species presence with habitat quality. One type of interesting alternative yields more high quality representation at the price of some reduction in overall representation. We present an application using a large dataset from California Gap Analysis to demonstrate this and other tradeoffs. Optimal solutions are attained using commercial integer programming software with very reasonable computational effort. 1040:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Cluster analysis of reference sites with similar biota is the initial step in creating River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) and similar river bioassessment models such as Australian River Assessment System (AUSRIVAS). This paper describes and tests an alternative prediction method Assessment by Nearest Neighbour Analysis (ANNA) based on the same philosophy as RIVPACS and AUSRIVAS but without the grouping step that some people view as artificial. The steps in creating ANNA models are: (i) weighting the predictor variables using a multivariate approach analogous to principal axis correlations (ii) calculating the weighted Euclidian distance from a test site to the reference sites based on the environmental predictors (iii) predicting the faunal composition based on the nearest reference sites and (iv) calculating an observed expected (O E) analogous to RIVPACS AUSRIVAS. The paper compares AUSRIVAS and ANNA models on 17 datasets representing a variety of habitats and seasons. First it examines each models regressions for Observed versus Expected number of taxa including the r(2) intercept and slope. Second the two models assessments of 79 test sites in New Zealand are compared. Third the models are compared on test and presumed reference sites along a known trace metal gradient. Fourth ANNA models are evaluated for western Australia a geographically distinct region of Australia. The comparisons demonstrate that ANNA and AUSRIVAS are generally equivalent in performance although ANNA turns out to be potentially more robust for the O versus E regressions and is potentially more accurate on the trace metal gradient sites. The ANNA method is recommended for use in bioassessment of rivers at least for corroborating the results of the well established AUSRIVAS and RIVPACS type models if not to replace them. 106:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1070:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The need for sound ecological science has escalated alongside the rise of the information age and   big data   across all sectors of society. Big data generally refer to massive volumes of data not readily handled by the usual data tools and practices and present unprecedented opportunities for advancing science and informing resource management through data intensive approaches. The era of big data need not be propelled only by   big science   the term used to describe large scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual driven culture of ecology. Collectively ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort a large volume of distributed high value information but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power. The scientists who contribute such information will be at the forefront of socially relevant science but will they be ecologists? 107:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examine the degree to which fitting simple dynamic models to time series of population counts can predict extinction probabilities. This is both an active branch of ecological theory and an important practical topic for resource managers. We introduce an approach that is complementary to recently developed techniques for estimating extinction risks  diffusion approximations) and like them requires only count data rather than the detailed ecological information available for traditional population viability analyses. Assuming process error we use four different models of population growth to generate snapshots of population dynamics via time series of the lengths commonly available to ecologists. We then ask to what extent we can identify which of several broad classes of population dynamics is evident in the time series snapshot Along the way we introduce the idea of   variation thresholds    which are the maximum amount of process error that a population may withstand and still have a specified probability of surviving for a given length of time. We then show how these thresholds may be useful to both ecologists and resource managers particularly when dealing with large numbers of poorly understood species a common problem faced by those designing biodiversity reserves. 1093:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems are emerging technologies in geomorphology. They offer the opportunity to gain fresh insights into biophysical systems through the spatial temporal spectral and radiometric resolutions of remote sensing systems and through the analytical and data integration capability of GIS. The two technologies can be linked together into a synergistic system that is particularly well suited to the examination of landscape conditions through the interrelationships of scale pattern and process a paradigm that has gained prominence in the fields of biogeography and landscape ecology. In this study we apply optical and microwave remote sensing systems and GIS methodologies to case studies framed within the fluvial and alpine environments. We use the scale pattern and process paradigm to explore landscape relationships in those environments. Satellite image processing change detection analyses digital elevation models GIS derived geomorphic indices and variables composition and pattern metrics of landscape organization and scale dependent analyses are described and related to the study of river channel abandonment and the alpine treeline ecotone. We describe appropriate remote sensing and GIS techniques for geomorphic research and demonstrate the use of such techniques in the application of the scale pattern and processes perspective in geomorphic studies. 110:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1168:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological models are useful tools for evaluating the ecological significance of observed or predicted effects of toxic chemicals on individual organisms. Current risk estimation approaches using hazard quotients for individual level endpoints have limited utility for assessing risks at the population ecosystem and landscape levels which are the most relevant indicators for environmental management. In this paper we define different types of ecological models summarize their input and output variables and present examples of the role of some recommended models in chemical risk assessments. A variety of population and ecosystem models have been applied successfully to evaluate ecological risks including population viability of endangered species habitat fragmentation and toxic chemical issues. In particular population models are widely available and their value in predicting dynamics of natural populations has been demonstrated. Although data are often limited on vital rates and dose response functions needed for ecological modeling accurate prediction of ecological effects may not be needed for all assessments. Often a comparative assessment of risk  relative to baseline or reference) is of primary interest. Ecological modeling is currently a valuable approach for addressing many chemical risk assessment issues including screening level evaluations. 1169:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological models have been developed and used in management of renewable natural resources conservation biology and assessments of ecological risks posed by toxic chemicals and other stressors. Because few models have been developed specifically for use in assessing chemical risks this study examines the realism and relevance of a wide range of ecological models from the perspective of assessing toxicological risks posed by chemicals. Model realism is evaluated relative to the degree of structural and functional description of the actual  real world) ecological entities or systems that is believed necessary for reliable estimation and management of risk. Relevance refers to the usefulness of model outputs in addressing the ecological impacts of interest in either generic or site specific assessment of risks posed by toxic chemicals. A model becomes increasingly relevant the more closely its outputs correspond to the endpoints of the risk analysis. In addition to the relatively few models  CASK IFEM AQUATOX) that have been designed specifically for ecological risk assessment we identify several models developed in support of basic research that might be adapted for realistic and relevant risk estimation. Population ecosystem and landscape models describe ecological phenomena from different perspectives. Associated with each perspective and resulting modeling approach are hypotheses concerning simplifying assumptions that facilitate the specification of model structure in relation to the ecological topic of interest. The structurally complex system models  AQUATOX CASM) attempt to explicitly represent the many biotic and abiotic processes and interactions that are believed to influence the production dynamics of aquatic populations included in the models. Future efforts in ecological risk assessment modeling should focus on identifying the necessary model complexity required to achieve sufficiently accurate and precise estimates of risk as defined by the needs of risk management and risk based decision making. Evaluations of model realism endpoint relevance flexibility ease of use and other characteristics may help to guide model users in their choice of specific models for further development and application to continuing challenges in assessing ecological risks. Clear definition of specific model capabilities and corresponding risk assessment endpoints can help to ensure that applications of existing ecological models to chemical risk assessments are appropriately customized to the needs of environmental risk assessors managers and decision makers. 1170:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The results of quantitative risk assessments are key factors in a risk managers decision of the necessity to implement actions to reduce risk. The extent of the uncertainty in the assessment will play a large part in the degree of confidence a risk manager has in the reported significance and probability of a given risk. The two main sources of uncertainty in such risk assessments are variability and incertitude. In this paper we use two methods a second order two dimensional Monte Carlo analysis and probability bounds analysis to investigate the impact of both types of uncertainty on the results of a food web exposure model. We demonstrate how the full. extent of uncertainty in a risk estimate can be fully portrayed in a way that is useful to risk managers. We show that probability bounds analysis is a useful tool for identifying the parameters that contribute the most to uncertainty in a risk estimate and how it can be used to complement established practices in risk assessment. We conclude by promoting the use of probability analysis in conjunction with Monte Carlo analyses as a method for checking how plausible Monte Carlo results are in the full context of uncertainty. 1171:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The selection of the most appropriate model for an ecological risk assessment depends on the application the data and resources available the knowledge base of the assessor the relevant endpoints and the extent to which the model deals with uncertainty. Since ecological systems are highly variable and our knowledge of model input parameters is uncertain it is important that models include treatments of uncertainty and variability and that results are reported in this light. In this paper we discuss treatments of variation and uncertainty in a variety of population models. In ecological risk assessments the risk relates to the probability of all adverse event in the context of environmental variation. Uncertainty relates to ignorance about parameter values measurement error and systematic error. An assessment of the full distribution of risks under variability and parameter uncertainty will give the most comprehensive and flexible endpoint. In this paper we present the rationale behind probabilistic risk assessment identify the sources of uncertainty relevant for risk assessment and provide an overview of a range of population models. While all of the models reviewed have some utility in ecology some have more comprehensive treatments of uncertainty than others. We identify the models that allow probabilistic assessments and sensitivity analyses and we offer recommendations for further developments that aim towards more comprehensive and reliable ecological risk assessments for populations. 1196:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, While some researchers have exploited the similarity between cyber attacks and epidemics we believe there is also potential to leverage considerable experience gained in other biological domains: phylogenetics ecological niche modeling and biomonitoring. Here we describe some new ideas for threat detection from biomonitoring and approximate graph searching and matching for cross network aggregation. Generic anomaly aggregation systems using these methods could detect and model the inheritance and evolution of vulnerability and threats across multiple domains and time scales. 119:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Toe clipping is a common method of marking anurans for population studies. We re analysed data from four published studies investigating the relationship between return rate and number of toes clipped for three anuran species: Bufo fowleri Crinia signifera and Hyla labialis. Although these studies claimed contradictory results a re analysis of the data with proper attention to statistical power demonstrated a statistically significant decline of 6 18 PeRcEnT in the probability of return for each toe removed after the first in three of the four studies examined. The probability that the fourth study would detect a statistically significant effect of toe clipping was low unless the size of the effect was overwhelming. These results provide consistent evidence that toe clipping decreases the return rate of marked anurans and demonstrates the importance of considering statistical power during data analysis. Use of toe clipping for mark recapture studies may produce estimates of population parameters that are biased by the same magnitude as the return rates unless researchers control for the effect of this marking method. 1200:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this paper we compare four methods for the reliable propagation of uncertainty through calculations involving the binary operations of addition multiplication subtraction and division. The methods we investigate are: (i) dependency bounds convolution; (ii) Distribution Envelope Determination; (iii) interval probabilities; and (iv) Dempster Shafer belief functions. We show that although each of these methods were constructed for different types of applications they converge to equivalent methods when they are restricted to cumulative distribution functions on the positive reals. We also show that while some of the methods have been formally constructed to deal only with operations on random variables under an assumption of independence all of the methods can be extended to deal with unknown dependencies and perfect positive and negative dependence among variables. 1205:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial depictions of fire regimes are indispensable to fire management because they portray important characteristics of wildland fire such as severity intensity and pattern across a landscape that serves as important reference for future treatment activities. However spatially explicit fire regime maps are difficult and costly to create requiring extensive expertise in fire history sampling multivariate statistics remotely sensed image classification fire behaviour and effects fuel dynamics landscape ecology simulation modelling and geographical information systems (GIS). This paper first compares three common strategies for predicting fire regimes ( classification empirical and simulation) using a 51 000 ha landscape in the Selway BitterrootWilderness Area of Montana USA. Simulation modelling is identified as the best overall strategy with respect to developing temporally deep spatial fire patterns but it has limitations. To illustrate these problems we performed three simulation experiments using the LANDSUM spatial model to determine the relative importance of ( 1) simulation time span; ( 2) fire frequency parameters; and ( 3) fire size parameters on the simulation of landscape fire return interval. The model used to simulate fire regimes is also very important so we compared two spatially explicit landscape fire succession models ( LANDSUM and FIRESCAPE) to demonstrate differences between model predictions and limitations of each on a neutral landscape. FIRESCAPE was developed for simulating fire regimes in eucalypt forests of south eastern Australia. Finally challenges for future simulation and fire regime research are presented including field data scale fire regime variability map obsolescence and classification resolution. 1209:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Dynamic energy budget (DEB) models describe how individuals acquire and utilize energy and can serve as a link between different levels of biological organization. We describe the formulation and testing of DEB models and show how the dynamics of individual organisms link to molecular processes to population dynamics and (more tenuously) to ecosystem dynamics. DEB models offer mechanistic explanations of body size scaling relationships. DEB models constitute powerful tools for applications in toxicology and biotechnology. Challenging questions arise when linking DEB models with evolutionary theory. 1228:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species distribution modelling is used increasingly in both applied and theoretical research to predict how species are distributed and to understand attributes of species environmental requirements. In species distribution modelling various statistical methods are used that combine species occurrence data with environmental spatial data layers to predict the suitability of any site for that species. While the number of data sharing initiatives involving species occurrences in the scientific community has increased dramatically over the past few years various data quality and methodological concerns related to using these data for species distribution modelling have not been addressed adequately. We evaluated how uncertainty in georeferences and associated locational error in occurrences influence species distribution modelling using two treatments: (1) a control treatment where models were calibrated with original accurate data and (2) an error treatment where data were first degraded spatially to simulate locational error. To incorporate error into the coordinates we moved each coordinate with a random number drawn from the normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 5 km. We evaluated the influence of error on the performance of 10 commonly used distributional modelling techniques applied to 40 species in four distinct geographical regions. Locational error in occurrences reduced model performance in three of these regions; relatively accurate predictions of species distributions were possible for most species even with degraded occurrences. Two species distribution modelling techniques boosted regression trees and maximum entropy were the best performing models in the face of locational errors. The results obtained with boosted regression trees were only slightly degraded by errors in location and the results obtained with the maximum entropy approach were not affected by such errors. To use the vast array of occurrence data that exists currently for research and management relating to the geographical ranges of species modellers need to know the influence of locational error on model quality and whether some modelling techniques are particularly robust to error. We show that certain modelling techniques are particularly robust to a moderate level of locational error and that useful predictions of species distributions can be made even when occurrence data include some error. 1230:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ecological niche is a fundamental biological concept. Modelling species niches is central to numerous ecological applications including predicting species invasions identifying reservoirs for disease nature reserve design and forecasting the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on species ranges. A computational analogue of Hutchinsons ecological niche concept (the multidimensional hyperspace of species environmental requirements) is the support of the distribution of environments in which the species persist. Recently developed machine learning algorithms can estimate the support of such high dimensional distributions. We show how support vector machines can be used to map ecological niches using only observations of species presence to train distribution models for 106 species of woody plants and trees in a montane environment using up to nine environmental covariates. We compared the accuracy of three methods that differ in their approaches to reducing model complexity. We tested models with independent observations of both species presence and species absence. We found that the simplest procedure which uses all available variables and no pre processing to reduce correlation was best overall. Ecological niche models based on support vector machines are theoretically superior to models that rely on simulating pseudo absence data and are comparable in empirical tests. Accurate species distribution models are crucial for effective environmental planning management and conservation and for unravelling the role of the environment in human health and welfare. Models based on distribution estimation rather than classification overcome theoretical and practical obstacles that pervade species distribution modelling. In particular ecological niche models based on machine learning algorithms for estimating the support of a statistical distribution provide a promising new approach to identifying species potential distributions and to project changes in these distributions as a result of climate change land use and landscape alteration. 1232:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding spatial structure and identifying subpopulations are critical for estimating population growth rates and extinction risk and as such essential for effective conservation planning. However movement and spatiotemporal environmental data are often unavailable limiting our ability to directly define subpopulations and their level of asynchrony. This study applies a recently developed statistical technique using time series analysis of abundance data to identify subpopulations. The approach uses multivariate state space models and Akaikes Information Criterion based model selection to quantify the data support for different subpopulation numbers and configurations. This technique is applied to the population of California sea lions Zalophus californianus in the Gulf of California Mexico distributed across 13 breeding sites. The abundance of California sea lions in the Gulf of California has declined over the last decade though not all areas have been equally affected. In light of this variation it is important to understand the population structure to ensure accurate viability assessments and effective management. Our data support the hypothesis that the Gulf of California sea lion population has four subpopulations each with 2 5 breeding sites. The dynamics between several adjacent subpopulations were correlated suggesting that they experience similar environmental variation. For each subpopulation we estimated long term growth rates as well as the environmental and observation variation. For most of the subpopulations our estimates of growth rates were considerably lower than those previously reported. In addition we found considerable variability across subpopulations in their projected risk of severe decline over the next 50 years. We illustrate a new multivariate state space modelling technique that uses time series of abundance to quantify the data support for different subpopulation configurations. Our analysis of the California sea lion population in the Gulf of California indicates that the population is spatially structured into four subpopulations each exhibiting distinct risks of extinction. Based on our results we recommend that conservation and management efforts in the Gulf of California focus on the two subpopulations with high probabilities of extinction within the next 50 years (Northern Midriff Southern Midriff). Multivariate state space models provide a practical approach to determine the spatial structure of virtually any species; they may be particularly useful for species of conservation concern for which data on dispersal and environmental drivers are likely to be scarce. 126:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Minimum convex polygons (convex hulls) are an internationally accepted standard method for estimating species ranges particularly in circumstances in which presence only data are the only kind of spatially explicit data available. One of their main strengths is their simplicity. They are used to make area statements and to assess trends in occupied habitat and are an important part of the assessment of the conservation status of species. We show by simulation that these estimates are biased. The bias increases with sample size and is affected by the underlying shape of the species habitat the magnitude of errors in locations and the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort. The errors affect both area statements and estimates of trends. Some of these errors may be reduced through the application of alpha hulls which are generalizations of convex hulls but they cannot be eliminated entirely. alpha hulls provide an explicit means for excluding discontinuities within a species range. Strengths and weaknesses of alternatives including kernel estimators were examined. Convex hulls exhibit larger bias than a hulls when used to quantify habitat extent and to detect changes in range and when subject to differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort and spatial accuracy. a hulls should be preferred for estimating the extent of and trends in species ranges. 128:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Synthetic products based on biodiversity information such as gap analysis depend critically on accurate models of species geographic distributions that simultaneously minimize error in both overprediction and omission. We compared current gap methodologies as exemplified by the distributional models used in the Maine Gap Analysis project with an alternative approach the geographic projections of ecological niche models developed using the Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP). Point occurrence data were used to develop GARP models based on the same environmental data layers as were used in the gap project and independent occurrence data used to test both methods. Gap models performed better in avoiding omission error but GARP better avoided errors of overprediction. Advantages of the point based approach and strategies for its incorporation into current gap efforts are discussed. 129:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,129:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a case study of the use of simulation modelling to develop and test strategies for managing populations under uncertainty. Strategies that meet a stock conservation criterion under a base case scenario are subjected to a set of robustness trials including biased and highly variable abundance estimates and poaching. Strategy performance is assessed with respect to a conservation criterion the revenues achieved and their variability. Strategies that harvest heavily even when the population is apparently very large perform badly in the robustness trials. Setting a threshold below which harvesting does not take place and above which all individuals are harvested does not provide effective protection against over harvesting. Strategies that rely on population growth rates rather than estimates of population size are more robust to biased estimates. The strategies that are most robust to uncertainty are simple involving harvesting a relatively small proportion of the population each year. The simulation modelling approach to exploring harvesting strategies is suggested as a useful tool for the assessment of the performance of competing strategies under uncertainty. 12:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,12:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,Species distribution prediction modeling plays a key role in biodiversity research. We propose to publish both species distribution data and modeling components as Web services and composite them into modeling systems using the scientific workflow approach. We build a prototype system using Kepler scientific workflow system and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. This study is the first step towards building a virtual e science laboratory for ecologists to perform distributed and cooperative research on species distribution predictions.1302:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, I present a conceptualization that attempts to unify diverse representations of natural knowledge while providing a workable computational framework based on current semantic web theory for developing communicating and running integrated simulation models. The approach is based on a long standing principle of scientific investigation: the separation of the ontological character of the object of study from the semantics of the observation context the latter including location in space and time and other observation related aspects. I will show how current Knowledge Representation theories coupled with the object oriented paradigm allow an efficient integration through the abstract model of a domain which relates to the idea of aspect in software engineering. This conceptualization allows us to factor out two fundamental causes of complexity and awkwardness in the representation of knowledge about natural system: (a) the distinction between data and models both seen here as generic knowledge sources; (b) the multiplicity of states in data sources handled through the hierarchical composition of independently defined domain objects each accounting for all states in one well known observational dimension. This simplification leaves modelers free to work with the bare conceptual bones of the problem encapsulating complexities connected to data format and scale. I will then describe the design of a software system that implements the approach referring to explicit ontologies to unambiguously characterize the semantics of the objects of study and allowing the independent definition of a global observation context that can be redefined as required. I will briefly discuss applications to multi scale multi paradigm modeling intelligent database design and web based collaboration. 1303:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge (SEEK) is a knowledge environment that is being developed to address many of the current challenges associated with data accessibility and integration in the biodiversity and ecological sciences. The SEEK information technology infrastructure encompasses three integrated systems: (1) EcoGrid an open architecture for data access; (2) a Semantic Mediation System based on domain specific ontologies; and (3) an Analysis and Modeling System that supports semantically integrated analytical workflows. Multidisciplinary scientists and programmers from multiple institutions comprise the core development team. SEEK design and development are informed by three multidisciplinary teams of scientists organized in Working Groups. The Biodiversity and Ecological Analysis and Modeling Working Group informs development through evaluation of SEEK efficacy in addressing biodiversity and ecological questions. The Knowledge Representation Working Group provides knowledge representation requirements from the domain sciences and develops the corresponding knowledge representations (ontologies) to support the assembly of analytical workflows in the Analysis and Modeling System and the intelligent data and service discovery in the EcoGrid. A Biological Classification and Nomenclature Working Group investigates solutions to mediating among multiple taxonomies for naming organisms. A multifaceted education outreach and training program ensures that the SEEK research products software and information technology infrastructure optimally benefit the target communities. 131:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The purpose of time series analysis via mechanistic models is to reconcile the known or hypothesized structure of a dynamical system with observations collected over time. We develop a framework for Constructing nonlinear mechanistic models and carrying Out inference. Our framework permits the consideration of implicit dynamic models meaning statistical models for stochastic dynamical systems which are specified by a simulation algorithm to generate sample paths. Inference procedures that operate on implicit models are said to have the plug and play property. Our work builds on recently developed plug and play inference methodology for partially observed Markov models. We introduce a class of implicitly specified Markov chains with stochastic transition rates and we demonstrate its applicability to open problems in statistical inference for biological systems. As one example these models are shown to give if fresh perspective on measles transmission dynamics. As a second example we present a mechanistic analysis of cholera incidence data involving interaction between two competing strains of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae. 1325:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, R users can often solve optimization tasks easily using the tools in the optim function in the stats package provided by default on R installations. However there are many other optimization and nonlinear modelling tools in R or in easily installed add on packages. These present users with a bewildering array of choices. optimx is a wrapper to consolidate many of these choices for the optimization of functions that are mostly smooth with parameters at most bounds constrained. We attempt to provide some diagnostic information about the function its scaling and parameter bounds and the solution characteristics. optimx runs a battery of methods on a given problem thus facilitating comparative studies of optimization algorithms for the problem at hand. optimx can also be a useful pedagogical tool for demonstrating the strengths and pitfalls of different classes of optimization approaches including Newton gradient and derivative free methods. 1326:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Text classifiers automatically classify documents into appropriate concepts for different applications. Most classification approaches use flat classifiers that treat each concept as independent even when the concept space is hierarchically structured. In contrast hierarchical text classification exploits the structural relationships between the concepts. In this article we explore the effectiveness of hierarchical classification for a large concept hierarchy. Since the quality of the classification is dependent on the quality and quantity of the training data we evaluate the use of documents selected from subconcepts to address the sparseness of training data for the top level classifiers and the use of document relationships to identify the most representative training documents. By selecting training documents using structural and similarity relationships we achieve a statistically significant improvement of 39.8 PeRcEnT (from 54.5 76.2 PeRcEnT) in the accuracy of the hierarchical classifier over that of the flat classifier for a large three level concept hierarchy. 1327:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio tests for nonlinear. non Gaussian state space models require numerical integration for likelihood calculations. Several methods including Monte Carlo (MC) expectation maximization MC likelihood ratios direct MC integration. and particle filter likelihoods. are inefficient for the motivating problem of stage structured population dynamics models in experimental settings. An MC kernel likelihood (MCKL) method is presented that estimates classical likelihoods up to a constant by weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posteriors. MCKL is derived by using Bayesian posteriors as importance sampling densities for unnormalized kernel smoothing integrals. MC error and mode bias due to kernel smoothing are discussed and two methods for reducing mode bias are proposed:   zooming in   on the maximum likelihood parameters using a focused prior based on an initial estimate and using a posterior cumulant based approximation of mode bias. A simulated example shows that MCKL can be much more efficient than previous approaches for the population dynamics problem. The zooming in and cumulant based corrections are illustrated with a multivariate variance estimation problem for which accurate results are obtained even in 20 parameter dimensions. 1329:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) a method is presented to develop a spatially explicit time series of land use in an urbanizing watershed. The method is prefaced on the existence of independent observations of land use at different times and data that describes the spatial temporal land use transition characteristics of the watershed between these two points in time. A method is then presented to generalize the TR 55 graphical method a common lumped hydrologic model for estimating peak discharge for use in a spatially explicit scheme. This scheme predicts peak discharge throughout a watershed rather than at a single selected watershed outlet. Coupling these two methods allows the engineer to model both the temporal and spatial evolution of peak discharge for the watershed. An illustrative watershed in a suburban area of Washington DC is selected to demonstrate the methods. The model results from these analyses are presented graphically to highlight the complex features in peak discharge behavior that exist both spatially as a function of position within the watershed drainage network and temporally as the watershed undergoes urbanization. These features are not commonly noted in most hydrologic analyses but are captured in these analyses because of the high spatial and temporal resolution of the methods presented. The physical implications of the modeled results are discussed in the context of the information content of a stream gauge located at the overall outlet of the illustrative watershed. This work shows that the common practice of transposition of gauge information to locations internal to the watershed would neglect internal variability in peak discharge behavior and could potentially lead to the determination of inappropriate design discharges. 1334:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Estimating the burden of infectious disease is complicated by the general tendency for underreporting of cases. When the reporting rate is unknown conventional methods have relied on accounting methods that do not make explicit use of surveillance data or the temporal dynamics of transmission and infection. State space models are a framework for various methods that allow dynamic models to be fitted with partially or imperfectly observed surveillance data. State space models are an appealing approach to burden estimation as they combine expert knowledge in the form of an underlying dynamic model but make explicit use of surveillance data to estimate parameter values to predict unobserved elements of the model and to provide standard errors for estimates. 1338:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Few food web theory hypotheses predictions can be readily tested using likelihoods of reproducing the data. Simple probabilistic models for food web structure however are an exception as their likelihoods were recently derived. Here I test the performance of a more complex model for food web structure that is grounded in the allometric scaling of interactions with body size and the theory of optimal foraging (Allometric Diet Breadth Model ADBM). This deterministic model has been evaluated by measuring the fraction of trophic relations it correctly predicts. I contrasted this value with that produced by simpler models based on body sizes and found that the quantitative information on allometric scaling and optimal foraging does not significantly increase model fit. Also I present a method to compute the p value for the fraction of trophic interactions correctly predicted by the ADBM or any other model with respect to three probabilistic models. I find that the ADBM predicts significantly more links than random graphs but other models can outperform it. Although optimal foraging and allometric scaling may improve our understanding of food webs the ADBM needs to be modified or replaced to find support in the data. . 1411:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecologists often use nonlinear fitting techniques to estimate the parameters of complex ecological models with attendant frustration. This paper compares three open source model fitting tools and discusses general strategies for defining and fitting models. R is convenient and (relatively) easy to learn AD Model Builder is fast and robust but comes with a steep learning curve while BUGS provides the greatest flexibility at the price of speed. Our model fitting suggestions range from general cultural advice (where possible use the tools and models that are most common in your subfield) to specific suggestions about how to change the mathematical description of models to make them more amenable to parameter estimation. A companion web site (https: groups.nceas.ucsb.edu nonlinear modeling projects) presents detailed examples of application of the three tools to a variety of typical ecological estimation problems; each example links both to a detailed project report and to full source code and data. 141:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1426:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Different analytical techniques used on the same data set may lead to different conclusions about the existence and strength of genetic structure. Therefore reliable interpretation of the results from different methods depends on the efficacy and reliability of different statistical methods. In this paper we evaluated the performance of multiple analytical methods to detect the presence of a linear barrier dividing populations. We were specifically interested in determining if simulation conditions such as dispersal ability and genetic equilibrium affect the power of different analytical methods for detecting barriers. We evaluated two boundary detection methods (Monmoniers algorithm and WOMBLING) two spatial Bayesian clustering methods (TESS and GENELAND) an aspatial clustering approach (STRUCTURE) and two recently developed non Bayesian clustering methods PSMIX and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) . We found that clustering methods had higher success rates than boundary detection methods and also detected the barrier more quickly. All methods detected the barrier more quickly when dispersal was long distance in comparison to short distance dispersal scenarios. Bayesian clustering methods performed best overall both in terms of highest success rates and lowest time to barrier detection with GENELAND showing the highest power. None of the methods suggested a continuous linear barrier when the data were generated under an isolation by distance (IBD) model. However the clustering methods had higher potential for leading to incorrect barrier inferences under IBD unless strict criteria for successful barrier detection were implemented. Based on our findings and those of previous simulation studies we discuss the utility of different methods for detecting linear barriers to gene flow. 1432:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Mantel test is widely used to test the linear or monotonic independence of the elements in two distance matrices. It is one of the few appropriate tests when the hypothesis under study can only be formulated in terms of distances; this is often the case with genetic data. In particular the Mantel test has been widely used to test for spatial relationship between genetic data and spatial layout of the sampling locations. We describe the domain of application of the Mantel test and derived forms. Formula development demonstrates that the sum of squares (SS) partitioned in Mantel tests and regression on distance matrices differs from the SS partitioned in linear correlation regression and canonical analysis. Numerical simulations show that in tests of significance of the relationship between simple variables and multivariate data tables the power of linear correlation regression and canonical analysis is far greater than that of the Mantel test and derived forms meaning that the former methods are much more likely than the latter to detect a relationship when one is present in the data. Examples of difference in power are given for the detection of spatial gradients. Furthermore the Mantel test does not correctly estimate the proportion of the original data variation explained by spatial structures. The Mantel test should not be used as a general method for the investigation of linear relationships or spatial structures in univariate or multivariate data. Its use should be restricted to tests of hypotheses that can only be formulated in terms of distances. 143:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1443:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Rodrigues criticizes our demonstration of low congruence in the global distributions of rare and threatened vertebrates on the grounds that we excluded locations where species counts were zero from our analyses. In practice this makes no substantive difference to our conclusions. Some sample locations are not inhabited by any organisms of interest: such locations can inflate measures of co variation and association because their values for parameters of interest (in this case zero counts of species) are identical. This bias has long been known (as the double zero problem 3); many ecological techniques and studies exclude double zero data for this reason. We are happy to clarify that we excluded double zero data. We concur with Rodrigues1 that including double zero data increases the observed correlation coefficient (r). Indeed it cannot fail to do so: r becomes a function of the ratio of double zero to non zero data. For example given our 19 564 terrestrial grid cells if fewer than 13 043 cells (two thirds of the worlds surface) are filled with perfectly negatively correlated richnesses and the rest with double zeroes a positive correlation is observed. In any such case including double zero data would be to predetermine the result: our comparison of rare mammals and amphibians involved only 3 184 non zero cells. This is sufficient justification for our choice of method. Treating all cells as informative as Rodrigues proposes becomes analogous to the analysis of binary presence absence data: it examines associations between cells that have any species of interest rather than the relative diversities of those cells. Such questions are better addressed by explicitly converting species counts to binary presence absence data before analysis. The analyses would rely more on the veracity of data on absence and the metrics of association will depend on the relative abundance of zero to non zero data. Rodrigues also criticizes our description of network performance; our two contrasting methods are shown in Fig. 1. Our definition equates performance with the trade off between network size and species capture. Rodrigues prefers a measure that quantifies the effectiveness of a network given its size. Both measures describe different aspects of reserve network performance. We prefer our definition in this case because we regard the comparison of absolute network sizes to be important. For example under Rodrigues definition the optimal network for rare mammals and the global 200 scheme have an effectiveness of around 70 PeRcEnT and 50 PeRcEnT respectively despite differing in area by more than an order of magnitude. We agree that good progress has been made in conservation planning and make no claim that the prospects from existing plans are dismal. We do argue however that the efficiency of conservation schemes can be improved by detailing where species across multiple higher taxa are found. 1464:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the importance of tropical biodiversity(1) informative species distributional data are seldom available for biogeographical study or setting conservation priorities(2 3). Modelling ecological niche distributions of species offers a potential soluion(4 7); however the utility of old locality data from museums and of more recent remotely sensed satellite data remains poorly explored especially for rapidly changing tropical landscapes. Using 29 modern data sets of environmental land coverage and 621 chameleon occurrence localities from Madagascar ( historical and recent) here we demonstrate a significant ability of our niche models in predicting species distribution. At 11 recently inventoried sites highest predictive success (85.1 PeRcEnT) was obtained for models based only on modern occurrence data (74.7 PeRcEnT and 82.8 PeRcEnT predictive success respectively for pre 1978 and all data combined). Notably these models also identified three intersecting areas of over prediction that recently yielded seven chameleon species new to science. We conclude that ecological niche modelling using recent locality records and readily available environmental coverage data provides informative biogeographical data for poorly known tropical landscapes and offers innovative potential for the discovery of unknown distributional areas and unknown species. 150:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1544:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is well known that ecological communities are spatially and temporally dynamic. Quantifying temporal variability in ecological communities is challenging however especially for time series data sets of less than 40 measurement intervals. In this paper we describe a method to quantify temporal variability in multispecies communities over time frames of 10 40 measurement intervals. Our approach is a community level extension of autocorrelation analysis but we use Euclidean distance to measure similarity of community samples at increasing time lags rather than the correlation coefficient. Regressing Euclidean distances versus increasing time lags yields a measure of the rate and nature of community change over time. We demonstrate the method with empirical data sets from shortgrass steppe old field succession and zooplankton dynamics in lakes and we investigate properties of the analysis using simulation models. Results indicate that time lag analysis provides a useful quantitative measurement of the rate and pattern of temporal dynamics in communities over time frames that are too short for more traditional autocorrelation approaches. 1549:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Null model tests of presence absence data (NMTPAs) provide important tools for inferring effects of competition facilitation habitat filtering and other ecological processes from observational data. Many NMTPAs have been developed but they often yield conflicting conclusions when applied to the same data. Type I and II error rates size power robustness and bias provide important criteria for assessing which tests are valid but these criteria need to be evaluated contingent on the sample size null hypothesis of interest and assumptions that are appropriate for the data set that is being analyzed. In this paper we confirm that this is the case using the software MPower evaluating the validity of NMTPAs contingent on the null hypothesis being tested assumptions that can be made and sample size. Evaluating the validity of NMTPAs contingent on these factors is important towards ensuring that reliable inferences are drawn from observational data about the processes controlling community assembly. 1569:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With the increasing concern about species conservation a need exists for quantitaive characterization of species geographic range and their borders. In this paper we survey tools appropriate for the quantification of static spatial patterns related to geographical ranges and their borders. We then build on these static methods to consider the problem of changes in geographic range through time. Methods discussed are illustrated using lark sparrow data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. While there is no such thing as the   best   or   only   method to analyze species geographical range and border we show that a series of methods can be used in sequence to provide complementary and useful quantitative information for species occupancy of range. Indeed the location of species borders estimated at different times can be compared to identify locations where species expand or go locally extinct. The ability to delineate accurately species ranges will be useful to conservation biologists managers and ecologists. 1570:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper describes a metadata interchange approach for semi automated integration of heterogeneous distributed databases. Our system prototype uses distributed metadata to generate a GUI tool for a meta user (who does the metadata integration) to describe mappings between master and source databases by assigning index number and specifying conversion function names; the system uses Quilt as its XML query language. The queries for the local databases being transparent for users are generated which is based on the metadata built semi automatically. An experiment testing feasibility is reported in which 3 different publishers databases are integrated. 1571:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many criteria for statistical parameter estimation such as maximum likelihood are formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility speed precision stability and built in methods to quantify uncertainty. 159:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,161:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1624:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The estimation and interpretation of temporal patterns in origination and extinction rates is a major goal of paleobiology. However the possibility of coincident variation in the quality and completeness of the fossil record makes the identification of such patterns particularly difficult. Previously Nichols and Pollock (1983) proposed that capture mark recapture (CMR) models be adapted to address this problem. These models can be used to estimate both sampling and turnover rates reducing the risk of confounding the two quantities. Since that time theoretical advances have made possible the application of these tools to a much broader range of problems. This paper reviews those advances likely to be of greatest relevance in paleobiological studies. They include (1) joint estimation of per taxon origination and extinction rates (2) modeling sampling or turnover rates as explicit functions of causal variables (3) ranking of alternative models according to their fit to the data and (4) estimation of parameter values using multiple models. These are illustrated by application to an Ordovician database of benthic marine genera from key higher taxa. Robustness of these methods to violation of assumptions likely to be suspect in paleobiological studies further suggests that these models can make an important contribution to the quantitative study of macroevolutionary dynamics. 1647:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recently advances in information technology and an increased willingness to share primary biodiversity data are enabling unprecedented access to it. By combining presences of species data with electronic cartography via a number of algorithms estimating niches of species and their areas of distribution becomes feasible at resolutions one to three orders of magnitude higher than it was possible a few years ago. Some examples of the power of that technique are presented. For the method to work limitations such as lack of high quality taxonomic determination precise georeferencing of the data and availability of high quality and updated taxonomic treatments of the groups must be overcome. These are discussed together with comments on the potential of these biodiversity informatics techniques not only for fundamental studies but also as a way for developing countries to apply state of the art bioinformatic methods and large quantities of data in practical ways to tackle issues of biodiversity management. 164:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Testing ecological models for management is an increasingly important part of the maturation of ecology as an applied science. Consequently we need to work at applying fair tests of models with adequate data. We demonstrate that a recent test of a discrete time stochastic model was biased towards falsifying the predictions. If the model was a perfect description of reality the test falsified the predictions 84 PeRcEnT of the time. We introduce an alternative testing procedure for stochastic models and show that it falsifies the predictions only 5 PeRcEnT of the time when the model is a perfect description of reality. The example is used as a point of departure to discuss some of the philosophical aspects of model testing. 1655:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, When there is qualitative information about the underlying professes and structure of a dynamical system it may be possible to infer very accurate quantitative information about these processes using only an output rime series from the system. We illustrate how this can be accomplished for time series data from a delay differential equation with a single fixed delay. Our approach exploits modem techniques for non parametric function estimation is robust to fairly high levels of dynamic noise and measurement error and can be extended straightforwardly to more general delay differential systems and multivariate systems. 166:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding spatial patterns of species diversity and the distributions of individual species is a consuming problem in biogeography and conservation. The Cape Floristic Region(CFR) of South Africa is a global hotspot of diversity and endemism and the Protea Atlas Project with some 60 000 site records across the region provides an extraordinarily rich data set to analyze biodiversity patterns. Analysis for the region is developed at the spatial scale of one minute grid cells(similar to 37 000 cells total for the region).We report on results for 40 species of a flowering plant family Proteaceae (of about 330 in the CFR) for a defined sub region. Using a Bayesian framework we develop a two stage spatially explicit hierarchical logistic regression. Stage one models the suitability or potential presence for each species at each cell given species attributes along with grid cell(site level) climate precipitation topography and geology data using species level coefficients and as patial random effect.The second level of the hierarchy models for each species observed presence absence at a sampling site through a conditional specification of the probability of presence at a arbitrary location in the gridcel lgiven that the location is suitable.Because the atlas data are not evenlydistributed across the landscape gridc ells contain variable numbers of sampling localities. Indeed some gridc cells are entirely unsampled; others have been transformed by humanintervention(agriculture urbanization)suchthatnoneofthespeciesare there though some may have the potential to be present in the absence of disturbance. Thus the modeling takes the sampling intensity at each site into account by assuming that the total number of times that a particular species was observed with in a site follows a binomial distribution. In fact a range o fmodels can be examined incorporating different first and second stage specifications.This necessitates model comparison in a misaligned multilevel setting.All models are fitted using MCMC methods.A   best  model is selected.Parameter summaries offer considerable insight. In addition results are mapped as the model estimated potential presence for each species a cross the domain. This probability surface provides an alternative to customary empirical   range of occupancy   displays. Summing yields the predicted species richness over the region. Summaries of the posterior for each environmental coefficient show which variables are most important in explaining species presence.Other biodiversity measures emerge as model unknowns.A considerable range of inference is available.We illustrate with only a portion of the analyses we have conducted noting that these initial results describe biogeographical patterns over the modeled region remarkably well. 1674:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A major challenge in ecology is forecasting the effects of species extinctions a pressing problem given current human impacts on the planet. Consequences of species losses such as secondary extinctions are difficult to forecast because species are not isolated but interact instead in a complex network of ecological relationships. Because of their mutual dependence the loss of a single species can cascade in multiple coextinctions. Here we show that an algorithm adapted from the one Google uses to rank web pages can order species according to their importance for coextinctions providing the sequence of losses that results in the fastest collapse of the network. Moreover we use the algorithm to bridge the gap between qualitative (who eats whom) and quantitative (at what rate) descriptions of food webs. We show that our simple algorithm finds the best possible solution for the problem of assigning importance from the perspective of secondary extinctions in all analyzed networks. Our approach relies on network structure but applies regardless of the specific dynamical model of species interactions because it identifies the subset of coextinctions common to all possible models those that will happen with certainty given the complete loss of prey of a given predator. Results show that previous measures of importance based on the concept of   hubs or number of connections as well as centrality measures do not identify the most effective extinction sequence. The proposed algorithm provides a basis for further developments in the analysis of extinction risk in ecosystems. 16:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,174:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1756:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems are widely used to model systems across the sciences and engineering. Such models are natural to formulate and can be analyzed mathematically and numerically. However difficulties associated with inference from time series data about unknown parameters in these models have been a constraint on their application. We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals perform residual analysis and apply other diagnostics. Our analysis based upon a model capturing the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the system reveals some effects overlooked by previous studies. 177:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Management of endangered species requires methods to assess the effects of strategies providing a basis for deciding on a best course of action. An important component of assessment is population viability analysis (PVA). The latter may be formally implemented through decision analysis (DA). These methods are most useful for conservation when used in conjunction. In this paper we outline the objectives and the potential of both frameworks and their overlaps. Both are particularly helpful when dealing with uncertainty. A major problem for conservation decision making is the interpretation of observations and scientific measurements. This paper considers probabilistic and non probabilistic approaches to assessment and decision making and recommends appropriate contexts for alternative approaches. 1791:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Applied scientific disciplines use mathematical models to make predictions. In the majority of cases these models are constructed using plausible mathematical characterizations of various component processes of the modelled system rather than being based entirely on exact mathematical descriptions of proven mechanisms. We use general arguments and a specific example from applied ecology to demonstrate that model predictions can show alarming sensitivity to apparently tiny changes in model specification in a manner that is counter intuitive and entirely invisible to conventional model sensitivity analysis. This result has serious implications for practical prediction using biological models. 1839:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The modern analog technique typically uses a distance metric to determine the dissimilarity between fossil and modern biological assemblages. Despite this quantitative approach interpretation of distance metrics is usually qualitative and rules for selection of analogs tend to be ad hoe. We present a statistical tool the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which provides a framework for identifying analogs from distance metrics. If modern assemblages are placed into groups  biomes) this method can (1) evaluate the ability of different distance metrics to distinguish among groups (2) objectively identify thresholds of the distance metric for determining analogs and (3) compute a likelihood ratio and a Bayesian probability that a modern group is an analog for an unknown (fossil) assemblage. Applied to a set of 1689 modern pollen assemblages from eastern North America classified into eight biomes ROC analysis confirmed that the squared chord distance (SCD) outperforms most other distance metrics. The optimal threshold increased when more dissimilar biomes were compared. The probability of an analog vs no analog result (a likelihood ratio) increased sharply when SCD decreased below the optimal threshold indicating a nonlinear relationship between SCD and the probability of analog. Probabilities of analog computed for a postglacial pollen record at Tannersville Bog (Pennsylvania USA) identified transitions between biomes and periods of no analog. 1874:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conceptual and logistical challenges associated with the design and analysis of ecological restoration experiments are often viewed as being insurmountable thereby limiting the potential value of restoration experiments as tests of ecological theory. Such research constraints are however not unique within the environmental sciences. Numerous natural and anthropogenic disturbances represent unplanned uncontrollable events that cannot be replicated or studied using traditional experimental approaches and statistical analyses. A broad mix of appropriate research approaches  long term studies large scale comparative studies space for time substitution modeling and focused experimentation) and analytical tools  observational spatial and temporal statistics) are available and required to advance restoration ecology as a scientific discipline. In this article research design and analytical options are described and assessed in relation to their applicability to restoration ecology. Significant research benefits may be derived from explicitly defining conceptual models and presuppositions developing multiple working hypotheses and developing and archiving high quality data and metadata. Flexibility in research approaches and statistical analyses high quality databases and new sampling appreaches that support research at broader spatial and temporal scales are critical for enhancing ecological understanding and supporting further development of restoration ecology as a scientific discipline. 187:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Regional to global scale modelling of N flux from land to ocean has progressed to date through the development of simple empirical models representing bulk N flux rates from large watersheds regions or continents on the basis of a limited selection of model parameters. Watershed scale N flux modelling has developed a range of physically based approaches ranging from models where N flux rates are predicted through a physical representation of the processes involved through to catchment scale models which provide a simplified representation of true systems behaviour. Generally these watershed scale models describe within their structure the dominant process controls on N flux at the catchment or watershed scale and take into account variations in the extent to which these processes control N flux rates as a function of landscape sensitivity to N cycling and export. This paper addresses the nature of the errors and uncertainties inherent in existing regional to global scale models and the nature of error propagation associated with upscaling from small catchment to regional scale through a suite of spatial aggregation and conceptual lumping experiments conducted on a validated watershed scale model the export coefficient model. Results from the analysis support the findings of other researchers developing macroscale models in allied research fields. Conclusions from the study confirm that reliable and accurate regional scale N flux modelling needs to take account of the heterogeneity of landscapes and the impact that this has on N cycling processes within homogenous landscape units. 188:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1918:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A computer simulation of North American end Pleistocene human and Large herbivore population dynamics correctly predicts the extinction or survival of 32 out of 41 prey species. Slow human population growth rates random hunting and Low maximum hunting effort are assumed; additional parameters are based on published values. Predictions are close to observed values for overall extinction rates human population densities game consumption rates and the temporal overlap of humans and extinct species. Results are robust to variation in unconstrained parameters. This fully mechanistic model accounts for megafaunal extinction without invoking climate change and secondary ecological effects. 1981:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Similar to content on the web scientific data is highly heterogeneous and can benefit from rich semantic descriptions. We are particularly interested in developing an infrastructure for expressing explicit semantic descriptions of ecological data (and life sciences data in general) and exploiting these descriptions to provide support for automated data integration and transformation within scientific workflows. Using semantic descriptions our goal is to provide scientists with: tools to easily search for and retrieve datasets relevant to their study  data procurement) the ability to select a subset of returned datasets as input to a scientific workflow and automated integration and restructuring of the selected datasets for seamless workflow execution. As part of this effort we are developing the Semantic Mediation System (SMS) within the SEEK project which aims at combining knowledge representation and semanticweb technologies  OWL and RDF) with traditional data integration techniques. We observe that along with these traditional approaches mediation of ecological data also requires external special purpose services for accessing information not easily or conveniently expressed using conceptual modeling languages such as description logics.The following are two specific examples of ecologically relevant external services that can be exploited for scientific data integration and transformation. Taxonomic Classification and Mapping. There is an extensive body of knowledge on species (both extinct and existing) represented in a variety of different taxonomic classifications and new species are still being discovered. The same species can be denoted in many ways across different classifications and resolving names of species requires mappings across multiple classification hierarchies. Within SMS we want to leverage operations that exploit these existing mappings to obtain synonyms of species names without explicitly representing the mappings or simulating the associated operations within the mediator. Semantics Based Data Conversion. We are interested in applying operations during mediation that can transform and integrate data based on their implied meaning. However for scientific data the nature of these conversions are often difficult to express explicitly within a conceptual model. A large number of ecological datasets represent real world observations (like measuring the abundance of a particular species) and therefore often have slightly different spatial and temporal contexts use different measurement protocols and measure similar information in disparate ways  area and count in one dataset and density which is a function of area and count in a second dataset). As with taxonomic classification we want the mediator to exploit existing conversion operations when possible. This short paper describes an initial logic based SMS prototype that leverages ontologies semantic descriptions and simple external services (primarily taxonomic) to help researchers find relevant datasets for ecological modeling. 1992:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Maps of vertebrate distributions resulting from the Kansas Gap Analysis were compared with maps based on ecological niche modeling of primary point occurrence information. The latter maps were considerably more predictive of independent sets of test data than were the Gap maps further supporting the idea that the method of Gap wildlife habitat modeling has little analytical power. In general the Kansas Gap maps were untested and unchecked thus being heterogeneous unreliable and of little use for further analyses. 1993:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We propose an infinitesimal dispersion index for Markov counting processes. We show that under standard moment existence conditions a process is infinitesimally (over )equi dispersed if and only if it is simple (compound) it increases in jumps of one (or more) unit(s) even though infinitesimally equi dispersed processes might be under equi or over dispersed using previously studied indices. Compound processes arise for example when introducing continuous time white noise to the rates of simple processes resulting in Levy driven SDEs. We construct multivariate infinitesimally over dispersed compartment models and queuing networks suitable for applications where moment constraints inherent to simple processes do not hold. . 1:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We investigate the incremental validation of XML documents with respect to DTDs specialized DTDs and XML Schemas under updates consisting of element tag renamings insertions and deletions. DTDs are modeled as extended context free grammars.   Specialized DTDs   allow the decoupling of element types from element tags. XML Schemas are abstracted as specialized DTDs with limitations on the type assignment. For DTDs and XML Schemas we exhibit an O(m log n) incremental validation algorithm using an auxiliary structure of size O(n) where n is the size of the document and m the number of updates. The algorithm does not handle the incremental validation of XML Schema wrt renaming of internal nodes which is handled by the specialized DTDs incremental validation algorithm. For specialized DTDs we provide an O(m log(2) n) incremental algorithm again using an auxiliary structure of size O(n). This is a significant improvement over brute force re validation from scratch. We exhibit a restricted class of DTDs called local that arise commonly in practice and for which incremental validation can be done in practically constant time by maintaining only a list of counters. We present implementations of both general incremental validation and local validation on an XML database built on top of a relational database. Our experimentation includes a study of the applicability of local validation in practice results on the calibration of parameters of the auxiliary data structure and results on the performance comparison between the general incremental validation technique the local validation technique and brute force validation from scratch. 2001:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Decades since the initial establishment of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in North America understanding and controlling the invasion of aquatic ecosystems continues to be a problem in continent wide conservation and landscape management. While the high economic and conservation burden of this species makes accurate predictions of future invasions a research priority forecasting is confounded by limited data tenuous model assumptions and the stochasticity of the invasion process. Using a new method for niche identification we profiled invasion vulnerability for 1 017 lakes in the Great Lakes region of the Unites States. We used a nonparametric geoadditive regression model to test for effects of two water quality variables on the present distribution of zebra mussels. We then used the support vector data description (SVDD) a support vector machine for one class classification to estimate the boundary of the ecological niche. By disentangling niche estimation from distributional assumptions computational niche models could be used to test an array of fundamental concepts in ecology and evolution while species invasions forecasting is representative of the wide range of potential applications for niche identification in conservation and management. 2018:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth bass M. dolomieu have been introduced into freshwater habitats in Japan with potentially serious consequences for native fish populations. In this paper we apply the technique of ecological niche modeling using the genetic algorithm for rule set prediction (GARP) to predict the potential distributions of these two species in Japan. This algorithm constructs a niche model based on point occurrence records and ecological coverages. The model can be visualized in geographic space yielding a prediction of potential geographic range. The model can then be tested by determining how well independent point occurrence data are predicted according to the criteria of sensitivity and specificity provided by receiver operator curve analysis. We ground truthed GARPs ability to forecast the geographic occurrence of each species in its native range. The predictions were statistically significant for both species (P   0.001). We projected the niche models onto the Japanese landscape to visualize the potential geographic ranges of both species in Japan. We tested these predictions using known occurrences from introduced populations of largemouth bass both in the aggregate and by habitat type. All analyses robustly predicted known Japanese occurrences (P   0.001). The number of smallmouth bass in Japan was too small for statistical tests but the 10 known occurrences were predicted by the majority of models. 2024:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We are delighted that our original paper has prompted journal editors to examine variation in the acceptance rates of papers by gender. However it might be worth pointing out that we had no a priori expectations concerning the proportions of male and female first authors in single blind review journals. We did not suggest that the increase in male authors observed in the Journal of Biogeography (JB) resulted from reviewer or other bias; it could well be driven by demographic shifts in the publishing community across time. The analysis by the editor of JB is interesting and escapes the limitation of our study that we did not have access to submission data. However this new analysis has a more serious limitation which is that without information on the quality of manuscripts analysis of rejection rates within a single journal is not sufficient to test hypotheses about bias. In the absence of this information what we need are comparisons of rejection rates across several journals within the same field which would allow for a test of the less assumptive hypothesis that the relative success of manuscripts according to gender should not vary across genders within a field. We are currently undertaking such a comparison in collaboration with Blackwell Publishers but unfortunately (in our view) JB declined to participate citing concerns over reviewer (and author) confidentiality and methodology It would also have been more informative had JB examined data from the same years as we did and provided values for submission and rejection rates as opposed to test results alone. Furthermore the analysis undertaken by Whittaker was performed using the journal database of corresponding authors (presumably for reasons of expediency) and not first authors as in our original analysis and therefore the two studies cannot be directly compared regardless of a degree of concordance within the JB data set. First author gender seems the more logical choice because this position is widely recognised as the primary author of a study especially because multiauthored papers are routinely abbreviated as first author . Based on his personal experience Whittaker expresses doubts that authors decisions regarding where to submit a manuscript are influenced by the peer review model of the journal. Although we agree that these decisions include multiple factors we do not feel that the experience of a single individual is sufficient to discount the possibility that review policy can influence submission decisions particularly because this experience is with a population of journals that do not vary in their review method that is they practise single blind review. In a survey of 1334 authors we found that there was a significant preference for double blind review in females as opposed to males and double blind review was also favoured by more junior authors. Additionally a survey of 386 ecologists showed that most (82 PeRcEnT) consider single blind review to be biased and that 84 PeRcEnT of respondents considered double blind review preferable to single blind review. So although we recognise the considerable editorial experience of Whittaker it is no substitute for the perspectives of a larger pool of ecology authors. We applaud editors for beginning to explore submission acceptance and rejection data and would recommend that these data be published annually within their journal to increase transparency and allow for comparison of trends across journals. We also fully endorse Whittakers call to explore the relative benefits of various peer review models. However such analysis is currently impossible because all major ecological and evolutionary journals with very few exceptions practise the same peer review model (singleblind). We therefore urge journals and publishers to consider implementing alternatives that would not only likely be more popular but would produce the most effective informed rigorous and objective scrutiny of submitted manuscripts. 2025:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With any given data set there is a large number of potential statistical and practical issues. In a study of the relative importance of double blind review we selected the most straightforward analytical approach a priori for comparison of data before and after a change in review policy and for a simple comparison with other similar journals. Admittedly a cornucopia of alternative post hoc approaches can be applied some of which probably would fail to detect any change. However we were clear that our study was observational and that the changes occurring at the journal where double blind review was introduced might be due to alternate variables. We recognise that one replicate does not constitute an effective test of a hypothesis; however it was unfortunately all that was available. Nonetheless the study is a compelling indication that changes in review policy can increase female representation through editor reviewer or author behaviour. It is 7 years since Behavioral Ecology (BE) introduced double blind review and no other journals in the field have followed its example despite demonstrated differences in outcomes between reviewing methods and prior evidence of bias in singleblind reviewing. Until we have a number of replicate journals we are unconvinced that the mixed modeling techniques and critique proposed by Webb . on a small and unbalanced data set are particularly illuminating. We agree that data on manuscript submissions acceptances and rejections would provide more insight into the value of double blind review. However these data are maintained by journals and are not freely available because of concerns over confidentiality and limitations of data extraction prior to electronic manuscript handling. We recognize that such data might reveal increased submissions by females and in our original article we did not suggest that the temporal increase in female first authors results from review policy alone as inferred by Webb . However a positive significant change was observed only in the double blind journal. The increase in female first authors within BE was 7.9 PeRcEnT whereas the mean of the other journals was 3.7 PeRcEnT 2.1 SD. So BE falls on the 95 PeRcEnT confidence interval (0.6 PeRcEnT 7.9 PeRcEnT). However if we were to remove data from Biological Conservation (BC) the mean and standard deviation become 2.87 1.4 SD and BE falls well outside the 95 PeRcEnT confidence interval (we note however that removal of BC does not impact the interpretations of the analyses by Webb . ). As indicated in our original article the instructions to authors within BC suggest that a double blind system may be utilized and we cannot rule out this affecting author behaviour. Perception can be a strong driver of change within science in terms of the studies we conduct and ideas we test and it is also probable that the journals we support might be selected based on attributes related to the review process. Indeed preliminary results from an online survey suggest that females and less experienced authors show a preference for submission to a double blind journal. We find it discouraging that Webb . find no reason to advocate consideration of alternative review policies. We do not propose double blind review at the expense of any other initiatives dedicated to increasing the representation of women in science. However the alternative of maintaining the status quo at the expense of a more objective review process that might benefit women junior researchers and international scholars because of the challenge in overcoming community scepticism appears short sighted and will limit the ability for more comprehensive questions about the effectiveness of journal review policies to be addressed in the future. Should the burden of proof not be on journals to examine existing data and explore alternative practices? Note added in proof Following acceptance of this letter in April 2008 Biological Conservation changed their online instructions to authors removing reference to an anonymous cover page. The authors support increased transparency regarding review methods by all journals such as the clarification made by Biological Conservation. 2029:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A recent study by Brook ef al. empirically tested the performance of population viability analysis (PVA) using data from 21 populations across a wide range of species. The study concluded that PVAs are good at predicting the future dynamics of populations. We suggest that this conclusion is a result of a bias in the studies that Brook  included in their analyses We present arguments that PVAs can only be accurate at predicting extinction probabilities if data are extensive and reliable and if the distribution of vital rates between individuals and years can be assumed stationary in the future or if any changes can be accurately predicted. In particular we note th at although catastrophes are likely to have precipitated many extinctions estimates of the probability of catastrophes are unreliable. 2036:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecology is inherently cross disciplinary drawing together many types of information to address questions about the natural world. Finding and integrating relevant data to assist in these analyses is crucial but is difficult owing to ambiguous terminology and the lack of sufficient information about datasets. Ontologies provide a formal mechanism for defining terms and their relationships and can improve the location interpretation and integration of data based on its inherent meaning. Ontologies have assisted other disciplines  molecular biology) in unifying and enriching descriptions of data and ecology can benefit from similar approaches. We review ontology efforts in ecology and describe how these can benefit research by enhancing the location and interpretation of relevant data for confronting crucial ecological questions. 2041:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Global knowledge about the spatial distribution of species is orders of magnitude coarser in resolution than other geographically structured environmental datasets such as topography or land cover. Yet such knowledge is crucial in deciphering ecological and evolutionary processes and in managing global change. In this review we propose a conceptual and cyber infrastructure framework for refining species distributional knowledge that is novel in its ability to mobilize and integrate diverse types of data such that their collective strengths overcome individual weaknesses. The ultimate aim is a public online quality vetted Map of Life that for every species integrates and visualizes available distributional knowledge while also facilitating user feedback and dynamic biodiversity analyses. First milestones toward such an infrastructure have now been implemented. 2046:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Information from natural history collections (NHCs) about the diversity taxonomy and historical distributions of species worldwide is becoming increasingly available over the Internet. In light of this relatively new and rapidly increasing resource we critically review its utility and limitations for addressing a diverse array of applications. When integrated with spatial environmental data NHC data can be used to study a broad range of topics from aspects of ecological and evolutionary theory to applications in conservation agriculture and human health. There are challenges inherent to using NHC data such as taxonomic inaccuracies and biases in the spatial coverage of data which require consideration. Promising research frontiers include the integration of NHC data with information from comparative genomics and phylogenetics and stronger connections between the environmental analysis of NHC data and experimental and field based tests of hypotheses. 2078:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The conservation of wildlife is closely linked with its habitat. Knowing the preferred habitat is crucial for most managers and researchers to conserve wildlife effectively. Here we present an software approach to presence only (wildlife location) data in order to derive habitat preferences in an automated but flexible fashion. The approach is based on presence and random locations derived from a telemetry and GIS study and uses for instance a GLM (Generalized Linear Model) to develop Resource Selection Functions (RSF). The presented approach is very flexible and computationally powerful and can easily be adjusted for various applications. We show how this approach is used for conservation applications by using endangered and charismatic wildlife species as examples. In addition we give an outlook of future applications for the presented method. 218:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The predictions of stochastic metapopulation models of four species of arboreal marsupial were compared to field data on patch occupancy. The species examined were the greater glider Petauroides volans the mountain brushtail possum Trichosurus caninus the ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus and the yellow bellied glider Petaurus australis. The models were developed for a system of 39 eucalypt patches in southeastern Australia embedded within an exotic plantation of radiate pine Pinus radiata. Additionally two alternative (null) models were developed for each species: one in which it was assumed that there was no impact of fragmentation; and a second that only modeled local population dynamics with no dispersal between patches. Congruence between the probability of occupancy of patches predicted by the metapopulation model and the actual occupancy observed in the field was assessed using tests of significance based on logistic regression. The relative performance of the three competing models was assessed for each species using Bayesian statistics. The results demonstrated that the metapopulation model made reasonable predictions for the greater glider and the yellow bellied glider. However none of the models predicted the observed increase in population density of mountain brushtail possums and ringtail possums in patches relative to continuous forests. Incorporating edge effects and inter specific interactions would improve the predictions for these two species. 224:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,230:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,242:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We compare two Monte Carlo (MC) procedures sequential importance sampling (SIS) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for making Bayesian inferences about the unknown states and parameters of state space models for animal populations. The procedures were applied to both simulated and real pup count data for the British grey seal metapopulation as well as to simulated data for a Chinook salmon population. The MCMC implementation was based on tailor made proposal distributions combined with analytical integration of some of the states and parameters. SIS was implemented in a more generic fashion. For the same computing time MCMC tended to yield posterior distributions with less MC variation across different runs of the algorithm than the SIS implementation with the exception in the seal model of some states and one of the parameters that mixed quite slowly. The efficiency of the SIS sampler greatly increased by analytically integrating out unknown parameters in the observation model. We consider that a careful implementation of MCMC for cases where data are informative relative to the priors sets the gold standard but that SIS samplers are a viable alternative that can be programmed more quickly. Our SIS implementation is particularly competitive in situations where the data are relatively uninformative; in other cases SIS may require substantially more computer power than an efficient implementation of MCMC to achieve the same level of MC error. 243:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,250:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,255:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Modeling has become an important tool in the study of ecological systems as a scan of the table of con tents of any major ecological journal makes abundantly clear. A number of books have recently been published that provide excellent advice on model construction building and use and add to the classic literature on modeling ecological systems and their dynamics. Un fortunately h however little if any of this growing literature on ecological modeling addresses the motivation to model and the initial stages of the modeling process information that beginning students would find useful. Fast computers and graphical software packages have removed much of the drudgery of creating models with a programming language and opened new avenues of model construction use and even misuse. There are many reasons why a student might want to consider modeling as a component of his or her education. Models provide an opportunity to explore ideas regarding ecological systems that it may not be possible to field test for logistical political or financial reasons. Often learning occurs from apparently st range results and unexpected surprises. The process of formulating an ecological model is extremely helpful for organizing ones thinking bringing hidden assumptions to light and identifying data needs. More and more students want to do something with modeling but are not sure how to get started. The goals of this article are to outline issues concerning the value of ecological models and some possible motivations for modeling and to provide an entry point to the established modeling literature so that those who are beginning to think about using models in their research can integrate modeling usefully. We therefore envision the typical reader to be an advanced undergraduate a beginning graduate student or a new modeler. We first consider some of the values of models and the motivation for modeling. We then discuss the steps involved in developing a model from an initial idea to something that is implemented on a computer outlining some of the decisions that must be made along the way. Many excellent texts and journal articles deal with the technical details of models and model construction; we do not attempt to replace this literature but rather try to make the reader aware of the issues that must be considered and point to some of the sources we have found particularly useful. We begin with the assumption that the reader has decided that he or she would like to do something with modeling as part of his or her research. It is important to recognize the difference between models and the modeling process. A model is a representation of a particular thing idea or condition. Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship. Alternatively models can be extremely complex and detailed such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems. The modeling process is the series of steps taken to convert an idea first into a conceptual model and then into a quantitative model. Because part of what ecologists do is revise hypotheses and collect new data the model and the view of nature that it represents often undergo many changes from the initial conception to what is deemed the final product. The discussion that follows is organized to consider issues in a sequence similar to what a new modeler would encounter. Because individuals backgrounds differ the sequence is not fixed. We map one possible route through the sorts of decisions that will most lik ely need to be considered; this course is derived from our individual experiences plus the collective knowledge of our reviewers. We begin with conceptual models because many people even self labeled nonmodelers formulate conceptual models.  257:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The 21st century is an exciting time for biological scientists and other researchers interested in complex systems. Relating biodiversity to ecological function and sustainability understanding the dynamics of coupled human and natural systems and unraveling functional genomics at scales ranging from organisms to community assemblages__to provide just a few examples__are challenging research opportunities that portend exciting and significant breakthroughs for science and society. Biological scientists and their colleagues from physical social mathematical and other disciplines are poised to explore many of these complex issues. In response to the need to address questions of increasing breadth and complexity the study of biocomplexity has emerged and continues to develop as both a research focus and a research program funded through the National Science Foundation. Because biocomplexity has so rapidly developed it seems appropriate to define biocomplexity examine some of the characteristics of biocomplexity and speculate on the future of biocomplexity studies. The objective of this article is to address these three issues in the context of both the scientific and funding environments that gave rise to biocomplexity. 26:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,271:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,274:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,27:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,281:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,299:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A key challenge for analyzing fisheries time series data has been to incorporate sources of uncertainty such as process error observation error and model structure uncertainty. Recent years have seen promising advances in methods for handling the first two together in a state space framework but likelihood calculations for state space models require high dimensional integrals which make their use computationally challenging. The first section of this paper reviews model fitting methods that use a state space model structure including errors in variables methods Bayesian methods that do and do not use the state space likelihood and the possibility of classical likelihood analysis with nonlinear non Gaussian state space models. It also discusses the relationship between true likelihood calculations and errors in variables likelihoods as well as the role of Monte Carlo methods in implementing Bayesian and or state space model analyses. The second section introduces a numerical method for calculating state space likelihoods without Monte Carlo methods and gives examples in a classical maximum likelihood framework. The method is applicable when the dimension of the state space at each time step is low. Although recent advances in model fitting and analysis methods are promising inferences from noisy data and complex processes will continue to be variable and uncertain. 2:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Risk assessments are performed routinely in many professional disciplines including population health nuclear and civil engineering mining economics and toxicology. Very often decisions in conservation biology depend on risk assessments. Typically these assessments focus on the ecology of a single species and its habitat sometimes extending to a relative handful of co occurring species or coincident habitats. Tools include PVAs rule sets and point scoring systems for assessing conservation status and methods for identifying assessing and ranking priorities for habitat in spatial contexts. This collection of papers describes research resulting from a working group on evaluating extinction risk assessment based at the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at Santa Barbara USA. McCarthy . created data for four hypothetical species. They then placed data on the web in a form that is commonly available to conservation biologists. People were challenged to estimate risks using either models or subjective judgement. The four data sets represented examples of different realistic situations. The frog data were from a population whose estimated parameters were uncertain. The snail data were from a species for which the parameters were well estimated and there was relatively little annual variability. Neither of these populations was declining. In contrast the herb and small mammal populations were declining. Risk of extinction in these models was based on parameter uncertainty annual variability in recruitment and in the case of the herb and small mammal trends in biomass. The accuracy of predictions was assessed by comparing them with the original true model. The study concluded that predictions using models tended to be less biased whereas subjective judgements were biased towards overestimation. The authors predicted that subjective bias is likely to vary unpredictably among people depending on their stake in the outcome making subjective predictions more uncertain and less transparent than those based on models. Andelman Groves and Regan evaluated nine methods available to the US Forest Service to select species at risk for the viability assessment process. They concluded that the methods that include current and future threats were the most useful in determining which species will be adversely affected by management and recommended that Heritage ranks be used to select an initial set of species for more detailed viability assessment. Maunder evaluated methods used in fisheries stock assessment that could be applied more generally in population viability analysis using the data created by McCarthy . The methods included Bayesian analysis and random effects models based on hierarchical modeling. The study found no substantial differences among the predictive capabilities of the different methods. All can generate reasonable results and they may play a beneficial role in conservation biology applications. However some of the models were complex and with large data sets could be difficult to apply. Regan Master and Hammerson translated the subjective elements of the Heritage ranking approach into a hybrid point scoring and rule based system. They took the subjective process used when performing Heritage assessments and through an iterative process refined rules to reflect the subjective weighting and combination of factors used by NatureServe scientists. They then tested the rules against subjective assessments conducted independently and found 77 PeRcEnT of species assessments using the explicit Heritage method matched the subjective assessments done by NatureServe staff. Of those that differed no rank differed by more than one rank level. The authors succeeded in creating a repeatable transparent and explicit benchmark for feedback and further development. These studies are among the first to test the efficacy and utility of a broad range of methods for assessing extinction risk. They identified some strengths and weaknesses that should assist conservation biologists to choose an approach that is appropriate for different problems. But the overwhelming result is that these studies complete in themselves only scratch the surface of the need to test validate and improve methods for assessing extinction risk.  302:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,303:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,303:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Identifying trade offs in fisheries presumes some knowledge about interactions between harvested species yet there is typically considerable uncertainly about the type and nature of food web interactions. Even relatively simple food webs can embody complicated and unknown interactions. For example a seemingly simple predator prey interaction contains unknowns regarding the shape of the functional response and also whether size structured interactions might make prey an important competitor of or predator oil the young of predators. I explored the potential biases resulting from using models that do not account for these interactions using a series of simulations based on naive models that either assume predator independent functional responses or do not include egg predation. Process models in which predictions are based on a mechanistic construction of food web interactions were prone to biases when they did not fully or accurately describe the nature of predator prey interactions. However inverse models where parameter estimates are derived from fitting the model to time series data had considerably less bias. These results suggest that inverse modeling methods are generally robust and that the inherent uncertainty in food web responses to harvesting is not a legitimate rationale for eschewing ecologically based approaches to fisheries management. 306:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,326:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Errors in estimates of current exploitable biomass from age structured stock assessment models typically propagate over time as though they had been computed by using a very simple Kalman filter equation. This equation shows that persistent overestimates of biomass during stock declines are caused mainly by three factors: first order autoregressive effects of past errors hyperstability in relative abundance indices and overestimates of current recruitment. Besides exposing these main causes of bias in biomass estimation the equation can be used to develop very efficient closed loop or management performance simulations and to provide timely biomass estimates in situations where it is not practical or economical to carry out full assessments every year. 328:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Historical apparent recruitment rates can be estimated from time series of relative abundance and catch data using a simple difference equation in conjunction with assumed catchability coefficient and natural survival rate. Simple smoothing and optimal linear state estimation procedures can remove much of the variance in such estimates due to measurement error in relative abundance. The apparent patterns can be helpful to reveal important recruitment changes prior to availability of data for more complex stock assessments provide checks on recruitments estimated by more complex assessment procedures and provide warnings about biases in other assessment procedures that might result from using the relative abundance data for model tuning. 334:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,336:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial catch per effort data can provide useful indices of population trends provided that they are averaged so as to correct for effects of changes in the distribution of fishing activity. Simple nonspatial ratio estimates should not be used in such analyses. The averaging for any time period must necessarily make some assumptions about what catch rates would have been in spatial strata that had not yet or were no longer being fished. Ignoring the unfished strata (averaging only over the areas that were fished) amounts to assuming that they behaved the same as the fished strata and can lead to severe hyperdepletion in abundance indices for fisheries that developed progressively over large regions. 337:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, State space models are commonly used to incorporate process and observation errors in analysis of fisheries time series. A gap in analysis methods has been the lack of classical likelihood methods for nonlinear state space models. We evaluate a method that uses weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posterior samples to estimate likelihoods (Monte Carlo Kernel Likelihoods MCKL). Classical likelihoods require integration over the state space and we compare MCKL to the widely used errors in variables (EV) method which estimates states jointly with parameters by maximizing a nonintegrated likelihood. For a simulated linear autoregressive model and a Schaefer model fit to cape hake (Merluccius capensis x M. paradoxus) data classical likelihoods outperform EV likelihoods which give asymptotically biased parameter estimates and inaccurate confidence regions. Our results on the importance of integrated state space likelihoods also support the value of Bayesian analysis with Monte Carlo posterior integration. Both approaches provide valuable insights and can be used complementarily. Previously Bayesian analysis was the only option for incorporating process and observation errors with complex nonlinear models. The MCKL method provides a classical approach for such models so that choice of analysis approach need not depend on model complexity. 338:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Stock reduction analysis (SRA) can complement more detailed assessment methods by using long term historical catches to estimate recruitment rates needed to have produced those catches yet still end up with stock sizes near those estimated by the detailed methods. A longer historical perspective can also add information to the estimation of reference points such as unfished biomass (B 0) or target biomass (B MSY). Deterministic SRA models provide a single stock size trajectory that is vanishingly unlikely to have actually occurred while stochastic SRA attempts to provide probability distributions for stock size over time under alternative hypotheses about unfished recruitment rates and about variability around assumed stock recruitment relationships. These distributions can be generated with age structured population models by doing large numbers of Monte Carlo simulation trials and retaining those sample trials for which the stock would not have been driven to extinction by historical catches. By resampling from these trials using likelihood weights (sampling importance resampling method) it is possible to move into fully Bayesian state space assessment modeling through a series of straightforward steps and to provide understandable visualization of how much the data help to reduce uncertainty about historical fishing impacts and stock status. 339:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Surplus production represents the processes that affect sustainable fishery harvest and is central to the ecology and management of marine fishes. Taxonomy and life history influence the ratio of spawning biomass at maximum sustainable yield to average unfished spawning biomass (SBMSY SB0) and estimating this ratio for individual stocks is notoriously difficult. We use a database of published landings data and stock assessment biomass estimates and determine that process errors predominate in this data set by fitting a state space model to data from each stock individually. We then fit multispecies process error models while treating SBMSY SB0 as a random effect that varies by taxonomic order and maximum length. The estimated SBMSY SB0 equals 0.40 for all 147 stocks is intermediate between the values assumed by the Fox and the Schaefer models although Clupeiformes and Perciformes have lower and Gadiformes and Scorpaeniformes have higher SBMSY SB0 values. Model selection supports the hypothesis that large bodied fishes for a given taxonomic order have relatively higher SBMSY SB0. Results can be used to define reference points for data poor fisheries or as input in emerging assessment methods. 34:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,354:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,359:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The LTER Grid Pilot Study was conducted by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications the University of New Mexico and Michigan State University to design and build a prototype grid for the ecological community. The featured grid application the Biophony Grid Portal manages acoustic data from field sensors and allows researchers to conduct real time digital signal processing analysis on high performance systems via a web based portal. Important characteristics addressed during the study include the management access and analysis of a large set of field collected acoustic observations from microphone sensors single signon and data provenance. During the development phase of this project new features were added to standard grid middleware software and have already been successfully leveraged by other unrelated grid projects. This paper provides an overview of the Biophony Grid Portal application and requirements discusses considerations regarding grid architecture and design details the technical implementation and summarizes key experiences and lessons learned that are generally applicable to all developers and administrators in a grid environment. 360:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,372:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Studying energetics of marine top predators is essential to understand their role within food webs and mechanisms associated with their survival and population dynamics. Several methods exist to estimate energy expenditure in captive and free ranging animals. However most of them are difficult to implement restrained to specific periods and are consequently inappropriate for seabirds. Supplementary and complementary approaches are therefore needed and the use of modelling appears as an excellent option allowing energetic studies when field data collection is challenging. Currently three main energetics models are used with various degrees of complexity and accuracy: allometric equations time energy budget analyses and thermodynamic models. However a comparison of their practicability and accuracy was still lacking. Here we present an overview of these 3 model types their characteristics advantages and disadvantages and areas of application in seabirds. We then investigate their accuracy by using them in parallel for the same dataset and by comparing outputs with direct measurements (doubly labelled water technique). We show that when detailed data are available time energy budget analysis is the best model to accurately predict seabird energy expenditures. Conversely thermodynamic modelling allows reasonably accurate calculations when field data are scarce and is therefore ideal to study energetics during the interbreeding season. 373:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A metadata approach for retrieval from heterogeneous distributed XML documents is given. A prototype system uses distributed metadata to generate a GUI data integration tool for describing mappings between master and local DTDs by assigning index numbers and specifying conversion functions. A DDXMI (Distributed Document XML Metadata Interchange) file is generated based on the mappings and used to translate queries over the virtual master document into sub queries to local documents.

If a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is applied logit functions are often used. Here we. show alternatives to the traditional logit approach using probit and the complementary log log link functions. We present a software based approach and two methods of assessing which link function performs best for inferences and for predictions. The first decision criterion is centered around the model deviance relevant for inferences. The second criterion is based on predicting the findings back to the training data and then using the differences between expected and predicted values for known presences and absences as an indication of the fit. As an example we use Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) nesting habitat data derived from aerial telemetry and overlaid with GIS habitat layers (DEM and Forest Cover). This data set is large and carries inherent noise due to field data and a complex landscape; therefore it well covers the extremes of the fitted link functions. It is a representative example for a situation where the selection of a link function could affect the results. Findings indicate that for our data all three link functions behave similar but logit link functions perform better than the cloclog and probit link functions when inferences as well as predictions are the study goals. 376:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Scientific workflows are becoming increasingly important as a unifying mechanism for interlinking scientific data management analysis simulation and visualization tasks. Scientific workflow systems are problem solving environments supporting scientists in the creation and execution of scientific workflows. While current systems permit the creation of executable workflows conceptual modeling and design of scientific workflows has largely been neglected. Unlike business workflows scientific workflows are typically highly data centric naturally leading to dataflow oriented modeling approaches. We first develop a formal model for scientific workflows based on an actor oriented modeling and design approach originally developed for studying models of complex concurrent systems. Actor oriented modeling separates two modeling concerns: component communication (dataflow) and overall workflow coordination (orchestration). We then extend our framework by introducing a novel hybrid type system separating further the concerns of conventional data modeling (structural data type) and conceptual modeling (semantic type). In our approach semantic and structural mismatches can be handled independently or simultaneously and via different types of adapters giving rise to new methods of scientific workflow design. 377:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present an approach to support incremental navigation of structured information where the structure is introduced by the data model and schema (if present) of a data source. Simple browsing through data values and their connections is an effective way for a user or an automated system to access and explore information. We use our previously defined Uni Level Description (ULD) to represent an information source explicitly by capturing the sources data model schema (if present) and data values. We define generic operators for incremental navigation that use the ULD directly along with techniques for specifying how a given representation scheme can be navigated. Because our navigation is based on the ULD the operations can easily move from data to schema to data model and back supporting a wide range of applications for exploring and integrating data. Further because the ULD can express a broad range of data models our navigation operators are applicable without modification across the corresponding model or schema. In general we believe that information sources may usefully support various styles of navigation depending on the type of user and the users desired task. 378:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many scientific disciplines are now data and information driven and new scientific knowledge is often gained by scientists putting together data analysis and knowledge discovery pipelines. A related trend is that more and more scientific communities realize the benefits of sharing their data and computational services and are thus contributing to a distributed data and computational community infrastructure (a.k.a. the Grid). However this infrastructure is only a means to an end and ideally scientists should not be too concerned with its existence. The goal is for scientists to focus on development and use of what we call scientific workflows. These are networks of analytical steps that may involve database access and querying steps data analysis and mining steps and many other steps including computationally intensive jobs on high performance cluster computers. In this paper we describe characteristics of and requirements for scientific workflows as identified in a number of our application projects. We then elaborate on Kepler a particular scientific workflow system currently under development across a number of scientific data management projects. We describe some key features of Kepler and its underlying Ptolemy II system planned extensions and areas of future research. Kepler is a community driven open source project and we always welcome related projects and new contributors to join. 379:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Scientific workflows often benefit from or even require advanced modeling constructs nesting of subworkflows cycles for executing loops data dependent routing and pipelined execution. In such settings an often overlooked aspect of provenance takes center stage: a suitable model of provenance (MOP) for scientific workflows should be based upon the underlying model of computation (MoC) used for executing the workflows. We can derive an adequate MoP from a MoC (such as Kahns process networks) by taking into account the assumptions that a MoC entails and by recording the observables which it affords. In this way a MoP captures or at least better approximates real data dependencies for workflows with advanced modeling constructs. As a specific instance we elaborate on the Read Write ReSet model a simple and flexible MoP suitable for a number of different MoCs. 381:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantification of biodiversity presents a two fold problem. First there is the question of what exactly we should be counting. If that question is not difficult enough it leads straight to the second practical question of how we can possibly accomplish such a count. At the species level for example even if we can decide what a species is we must in practice use surrogate information to quantify relative numbers of species in different places. 38:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,396:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,396:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite numerous claims that population viability analysis (PYA) makes reliable predictions of the relative risks of extinction there is little evidence to support this assertion. To assess the veracity of the claim we investigated uncertainty in the relative predictions of a PVA model with simulation experiments. We used a stochastic Ricker model to investigate the reliability of predicted changes in risks of decline in response to changes in parameters the reliability of ranking species in terms of their relative threat and the reliability of choosing the better of two management decisions. The predicted changes in risks of decline within 100 years were more reliable than absolute predictions. We made useful predictions of relative risks using only 10 years of data. Across 160 different parameter combinations the rank correlation between the true risks of extinction within 100 years and predicted risks was 0.59 with 10 years of data increasing to 0.89 with 100 years of data. We identified the better of two management strategies 67 74 PeRcEnT of the time using 10 years of data increasing to 92 93 PeRcEnT of the time with 100 years of data. Our results demonstrate that despite considerable uncertainty in the predicted risks of decline PVA may reliably contribute to the management of threatened species. 397:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the growing use of population viability analysis (PTA) the predictions of these models rarely have been tested with field data that were not used In initially developing the model We review and discuss a suite of methods that may be used to test the predictive ability of models used in PVA. In addition to testing mean predictions appropriate methods must analyze the probability distribution of the model predictions. The methods we discuss provide tests of the mean predictions the predicted frequency of events such cis extinction and colonization and the predicted probability distribution of state variables. We discuss visual approaches based on plots of observations versus the predictions and statistical approaches based on determining significant differences between observations and predictions. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are identified. The best methods test the statistical distribution of the predictions; those that ignore variability are meaningless. Although ive recognize that the quality of a model is not solely a function of its predictive abilities tests help reduce inherent model uncertainty. The role of model testing is not to prove the truth of a model which is impossible because models are never a perfect description of reality. Rather. testing should help identify the weakest aspects of models so they can be improved. We provide a framework for using model testing to improve the predictive performance of PVA models through an iterative process of model development testing subsequent modification and re testing. 398:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Distribution data on biodiversity features is a major component of conservation planning that are often inaccurate; thus the true distribution of each feature is commonly over or underrepresented. The selection of distribution data sets may therefore lead to variability in the spatial configuration and size of proposed reserve networks and uncertainty regarding the extent to which these networks actually contain the biodiversity features they were identified to protect. Our goals were to investigate the impact on reserve selection of choosing different distribution data sets and to propose novel methods to minimize uncertainty about target attainment within reserves. To do so we used common prioritization methods (richness mapping systematic reserve design and a novel approach that integrates multiple types of distribution data) and three types of data on the distribution of mammals (predicted distribution models occurrence records and a novel combination of the two) to simulate the establishment of regional biodiversity reserves for the state of Arizona (U. S. A.). Using the results of these simulations we explored variability in reserve placement and size as a function of the distribution data set. Spatial overlap of reserve networks identified with only predicted distribution data or only occurrence distribution data never exceeded 16 PeRcEnT. In pairwise comparisons between reserves created with all three types of distribution data overlap never achieved 50 PeRcEnT. The reserve size required to meet conservation targets also varied with the type of distribution data used and the conservation goal; the largest reserve system was 10 times the smallest. Our results highlight the impact of employing different types of distribution data and identify novel tools for application to existing distribution data sets that can minimize uncertainty about target attainment. 400:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Estimating the risk of extinction for populations of endangered species is an important component of conservation biology. These estimates must be made from data that contain both environmental noise in the year to year transitions in population size (so called   process error  ) random errors in sampling and possible biases in sampling (both forms of observation errors). To determine how much faith to place in estimated extinction rates it is important to know how sensitive they are to observation error. We used three simple commonly employed models of population dynamics to generate simulated population time series. We then combined random observation error or systematic biases with those data fit models to the time series data and observed how close the extinction dynamics of the fitted models compared with the dynamics of the underlying models. We found that systematic biases in sampling rarely affected estimates of extinction estimates except over a small range of process errors corresponding to the region where extinction risk is most uncertain. With more substantial sampling error estimates of extinction risk degraded rapidly. Field census techniques for a variety of taxa often involve observation error within 32 PeRcEnT of actual population sizes. For typical time series used in conservation therefore we often may not need to be overly concerned about observation errors as an extra source of imperfection in our estimated extinction rates. 410:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Realistic time frames in which management decisions are made often preclude the completion of the detailed analyses necessary for conservation planning. Under these circumstances efficient alternatives may assist in approximating the results of more thorough studies that require extensive resources and time. We outline a set of concepts and formulas that may be used in lieu of detailed population viability analyses and habitat modeling exercises to estimate the protected areas required to provide desirable conservation outcomes for a suite of threatened plant species. We used expert judgment of parameters and assessment of a population size that results in a specified quasiextinction risk based on simple dynamic models The area required to support a population of this size is adjusted to take into account deterministic and stochastic human influences including small scale disturbance deterministic trends such as habitat loss and changes in population density through processes such as predation and competition. We set targets for different disturbance regimes and geographic regions. We applied our methods to Banksia cuneata Boronia keysii and Parsonsia dorrigoensis resulting in target areas for conservation of 1102 733 and 1084 ha respectively. These results provide guidance on target areas and priorities for conservation strategies. 419:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,425:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,429:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,435:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,441:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,446:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,454:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Good forecasts of climate change impacts on extinction risks are critical for effective conservation management responses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are central to extinction risk analyses. The reliability of predictions of SDMs has been questioned because models often lack a mechanistic underpinning and rely on assumptions that are untenable under climate change. We show how integrating predictions from fundamentally different modeling strategies produces robust forecasts of climate change impacts on habitat and population parameters. We illustrate the principle by applying mechanistic (Niche Mapper) and correlative (Maxent Bioclim) SDMs to predict current and future distributions and fertility of an Australian gliding possum. The two approaches make congruent accurate predictions of current distribution and similar dire predictions about the impact of a warming scenario supporting previous correlative only predictions for similar species. We argue that convergent lines of independent evidence provide a robust basis for predicting and managing extinctions risks under climate change. 456:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,45:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Animals often select one item from a set of candidates as when choosing a foraging site or mate and are expected to possess accurate and efficient rules for acquiring information and making decisions. Little is known however about the decision rules animals use. We compare patterns of information sampling by western scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica) when choosing a nut with three decision rules: best of n (BN) flexible threshold (FT) and comparative Bayes (CB). First we use a null hypothesis testing approach and find that the CB decision rule in which individuals use past experiences to make nonrandom assessment and choice decisions produces patterns of behavior that more closely correspond to observed patterns of nut sampling in scrub jays than the other two rules. This approach does not allow us to quantify how much better CB is at predicting scrub jay behavior than the other decision rules. second we use a model selection approach that uses Akaike information Criteria to quantify how well alternative models approximate observed data. We find that the CB rule is much more likely to produce the observed patterns of scrub jay behavior than the other rules. This result provides some of the best empirical evidence of the use of Bayesian information updating by a nonhuman animal. 467:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We describe a framework called the Uni Level Description (ULD) for accurately representing information from a broad range of data models. The ULD extends previous meta data model approaches by: (a) providing uniform representation and access to data model schema and data and (b) supporting data models with non traditional schema arrangements including those that allow optional and multiple levels of schema. Because the ULD is a flat first order representation we show how Datalog over the ULD can provide a flexible mechanism to query extract and transform information from data sources that exhibit various types of structural heterogeneity. 469:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecologists spend considerable effort integrating heterogeneous data for statistical analyses and simulations for example to run and test predictive models. Our research is focused on reducing this effort by providing data integration and transformation tools allowing researchers to focus on   real science    that is discovering new knowledge through analysis and modeling. This paper defines a generic framework for transforming heterogeneous data within scientific workflows. Our approach relies on a formalized ontology which serves as a simple unstructured global schema. In the framework inputs and outputs of services within scientific workflows can have structural types and separate semantic types (expressions of the target ontology). In addition a registration mapping can be defined to relate input and output structural types to their corresponding semantic types. Using registration mappings appropriate data transformations can then be generated for each desired service composition. Here we describe our proposed framework and an initial implementation for services that consume and produce XML data. 46:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,470:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Steps in scientific workflows often generate collections of results causing the data flowing through workflows to become increasingly nested. Because conventional workflow components (or actors) typically operate on simple or application specific data types additional actors often are required to manage these nested data collections. As a result conventional workflows become increasingly complex as data becomes more nested. This paper describes a new paradigm for developing scientific workflows that transparently manages nested data collections. Collection oriented workflows have a number of advantages over conventional approaches including simpler workflow designs  requiring fewer actors and control flow constructs) that are invariant under changes in data nesting. Our implementation within the KEPLER scientific workflow system enables the explicit representation of collections and collection schemas concurrent operation over collection contents via multi level pipeline parallelism and allows collection aware actors to be composed readily from conventional actors. 471:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,This paper discusses an ontology based visual query system of Ecosystem Services Database.

Despite this concerns remain that the invasion process is too complex for accurate predictions to be made. Our goal was to test risk assessment performance across a range of taxonomic and geographical scales at different points in the invasion process with a range of statistical and machine learning algorithms. Regional to global data sets. We selected six data sets differing in size geography and taxonomic scope. For each data set we created seven risk assessment tools using a range of statistical and machine learning algorithms. Performance of tools was compared to determine the effects of data set size and scale the algorithm used and to determine overall performance of the trait based risk assessment approach. Risk assessment tools with good performance were generated for all data sets. Random forests (RF) and logistic regression (LR) consistently produced tools with high performance. Other algorithms had varied performance. Despite their greater power and flexibility machine learning algorithms did not systematically outperform statistical algorithms. Geographic scope of the data set and size of the data set did not systematically affect risk assessment performance. Across six representative data sets we were able to create risk assessment tools with high performance. Additional data sets could be generated for other taxonomic groups and regions and these could support efforts to prevent the arrival of new invaders. Random forests and LR approaches performed well for all data sets and could be used as a standard approach to risk assessment development. 482:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Current circumstances that the majority of species distribution records exist as presence only data  from museums and herbaria) and that there is an established need for predictions of species distributions mean that scientists and conservation managers seek to develop robust methods for using these data. Such methods must in particular accommodate the difficulties caused by lack of reliable information about sites where species are absent. Here we test two approaches for overcoming these difficulties analysing a range of data sets using the technique of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). MARS is closely related to regression techniques such as generalized additive models (GAMs) that are commonly and successfully used in modelling species distributions but has particular advantages in its analytical speed and the ease of transfer of analysis results to other computational environments such as a Geographic Information System. MARS also has the advantage that it can model multiple responses meaning that it can combine information from a set of species to determine the dominant environmental drivers of variation in species composition. We use data from 226 species from six regions of the world and demonstrate the use of MARS for distribution modelling using presence only data. We test whether (1) the type of data used to represent absence or background and (2) the signal from multiple species affect predictive performance by evaluating predictions at completely independent sites where genuine presence absence data were recorded. Models developed with absences inferred from the total set of presence only sites for a biological group and using simultaneous analysis of multiple species to inform the choice of predictor variables performed better than models in which species were analysed singly or in which pseudo absences were drawn randomly from the study area. The methods are fast relatively simple to understand and useful for situations where data are limited. A tutorial is included. 486:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predictive species distribution modelling (SDM) has become an essential tool in biodiversity conservation and management. The choice of grain size (resolution) of environmental layers used in modelling is one important factor that may affect predictions. We applied 10 distinct modelling techniques to presence only data for 50 species in five different regions to test whether: (1) a 10 fold coarsening of resolution affects predictive performance of SDMs and (2) any observed effects are dependent on the type of region modelling technique or species considered. Results show that a 10 times change in grain size does not severely affect predictions from species distribution models. The overall trend is towards degradation of model performance but improvement can also be observed. Changing grain size does not equally affect models across regions techniques and species types. The strongest effect is on regions and species types with tree species in the data sets (regions) with highest locational accuracy being most affected. Changing grain size had little influence on the ranking of techniques: boosted regression trees remain best at both resolutions. The number of occurrences used for model training had an important effect with larger sample sizes resulting in better models which tended to be more sensitive to grain. Effect of grain change was only noticeable for models reaching sufficient performance and or with initial data that have an intrinsic error smaller than the coarser grain size. 487:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,492:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Concepts of spatial scale such as extent grain resolution range footprint support and cartographic ratio are not interchangeable. Because of the potential confusion among the definitions of these terms we suggest that authors avoid the term   scale   and instead refer to specific concepts. In particular we are careful to discriminate between observation scales scales of ecological phenomena and scales used in spatial statistical analysis. When scales of observation or analysis change that is when the unit size shape spacing or extent are altered statistical results are expected to change. The kinds of results that may change include estimates of the population mean and variance the strength and character of spatial autocorrelation and spatial anisotropy patch and gap sizes and multivariate relationships The First three of these results (precision of the mean variance and spatial autocorrelation) can sometimes be estimated using geostatistical support effect models. We present four case studies of organism abundance and cover illustrating some of these changes and how conclusions about ecological phenomena (process and structure) may be affected. We identify the influence of observational scale on statistical results as a subset of what geographers call the Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP). The way to avoid the MAUP is by careful construction of sampling design and analysis. We recommend a set of considerations for sampling design to allow useful tests for specific scales of a phenomenon under study. We further recommend that ecological studies completely report all components of observation and analysis scales to increase the possibility of cross study comparisons. 495:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In ecological field surveys observations are gathered at different spatial locations. The purpose may be to relate biological response variables  species abundances) to explanatory environmental variables  soil characteristics). In the absence of prior knowledge ecologists have been taught to rely on systematic or random sampling designs. If there is prior knowledge about the spatial patterning of the explanatory variables obtained from either previous surveys or a pilot study can we use this information to optimize the sampling design in order to maximize our ability to detect the relationships between the response and explanatory variables? The specific questions addressed in this paper are: a) What is the effect (type I error) of spatial autocorrelation on the statistical tests commonly used by ecologists to analyse field survey data? b) Can we eliminate or at least minimize the effect of spatial autocorrelation by the design of the survey? Are there designs that provide greater power for surveys at least tinder certain circumstances? c) Can we eliminate or control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation during the analysis? To answer the last question we compared regular regression analysis to a niodified t test developed by Dutilleul for correlation coefficients in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Replicated surfaces (typically 1000 of them) were simulated using different spatial parameters and these surfaces were subjected to different sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis. The simulated surfaces may represent for example vegetation response to underlying environmental variation. This allowed us 1) to measure the frequency of type I error (the failure to reject the null hypothesis when in fact there is no effect of the environment on the response variable) and 2) to estimate the power of the different combinations of sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis (power is measured by the rate of rejection of the null hypothesis when an effect of the environment on the response variable has been created). Our results indicate that: 1) Spatial autocorrelation in both the response and environmental variables affects the classical tests of significance of correlation or regression coefficients. Spatial autocorrelation in only one of the two variables does not affect the test of significance 2) A broad scale spatial structure present in data has the same effect on the tests as spatial autocorrelation. When such a structure is present in one of the variables and autocorrelation is found in the other or in both the tests of significance have inflated rates of type I error. 3) Dutilleuls modified t test for the correlation coefficient corrected for spatial auto correlation effectively corrects for spatial autocorrelation in the data It also effectively corrects for the presence of deterministic structures with or without spatial autocorrelation. The presence of a broad scale deterministic structure may in some cases reduce the power of the modified t test. 496:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In many areas of ecology there is an increasing emphasis on spatial relationships. Often ecologists are interested in new ways of analyzing data with the objective of quantifying spatial patterns and in designing surveys and experiments in light of the recognition that there may be underlying spatial pattern in biotic responses. In doing so ecologists have adopted a number of widely different techniques and approaches derived from different schools of thought and from other scientific disciplines. While the adaptation of a diverse array of statistical approaches and methodologies for the analysis of spatial data has yielded considerable insight into various ecological problems this diversity of approaches has sometimes impeded communication and retarded more rapid progress in this emergent area. Many of these different statistical methods provide similar information about spatial characteristics but the differences among these methods make it difficult to compare the results of studies that employ contrasting approaches. The papers in this mini series explore possible areas of agreement and synthesis between a diversity of approaches to spatial analysis in ecology. 498:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Prediction of species distributions is central to diverse applications in ecology evolution and conservation science. There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence only data to fit models and independent presence absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species distributions. These include machine learning methods and community models both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information as is typical of species occurrence data. Presence only data were effective for modelling species distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve. 499:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Statistical models of environment abundance relationships may be influenced by spatial autocorrelation in abundance environmental variables or both Failure to account for spatial autocorrelation can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding both the absolute and relative importance of environmental variables as determinants of abundance. We consider several classes of statistical models that are appropriate for modeling environment abundance relationships in the presence of spatial autocorrelation and apply these to three case studies: 1) abundance of voles in relation to habitat characteristics; 2) a plant competition experiment; and 3) abundance of Orbatid mites along environmental gradients. We find that when spatial pattern is accounted for in the modeling process conclusions about environmental control over abundance can change dramatically. We conclude with five lessons: 1) spatial models are easy to calculate with several of the most common statistical packages; 2) results from spatially structured models may point to conclusions radically different from those suggested by a spatially independent model; 3) not all spatial autocorrelation in abundances results from spatial population dynamics; it may also result from abundance associations with environmental variables not included in the model; 4) the different spatial models do have different mechanistic interpretations in terms of ecological processes thus ecological model selection should take primacy over statistical model selection; 5) the conclusions of the different spatial models are typically fairly similar making any correction is more important than quibbling about which correction to make. 500:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper aims to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in spatial analysis to help in their choice of techniques It uses examples to compare methods of spatial analysis for ecological field data. A taxonomy of different data types is presented including point and area referenced data with and without attributes. Spatially and non spatially explicit data are distinguished. The effects of sampling and other transformations that convert one data type to another are discussed; the possible loss of spatial information is considered. Techniques for analyzing spatial pattern developed in plant ecology animal ecology landscape ecology geostatistics and applied statistics are reviewed briefly and their overlap in methodology and philosophy noted. The techniques are categorized according to their output and the inferences that may be drawn from them in a discursive style without formulae. Methods are compared for four case studies with field data covering a range of types. These are: 1) percentage cover of three shrubs along a line transect 2) locations and volume of a desert plant in a I ha area: 3) a remotely sensed spectral index and elevation from 10(5) km(2) of a mountainous region; and 4) land cover from three rangeland types within 800 km2 of a coastal region. Initial approaches utilize mapping frequency distributions and variance mean indices. Analysis techniques we compare include: local quadrat variance block quadrat variance correlograms variograms angular correlation directional variograms wavelets SADIE nearest neighbour methods Ripleys L(t) and various landscape ecology metrics. Our advice to ecologists is to use simple visualization techniques for initial analysis and subsequently to select methods that are appropriate for the data type and that answer their specific questions of interest It is usually prudent to employ several different techniques. 505:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,508:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,515:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,520:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,524:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Estimating the risk of extinction is one of the central foci of conservation biology but such estimates are often constrained by the available data. In the face of limited data. several authors have suggested using diffusion approximations to estimate the mean time to extinction as a means of quantifying the risk of extinction. However the accuracy of the diffusion approximation for characterizing extinction processes has not been well tested. We develop a simulation model that includes life history parameters and incorporates both demographic and environmental stochasticity in population dynamics. We use the simulation model to study the effects of stochasticity on the accuracy of the diffusion approximation across different life history strategies. Our results show that predictions for mean time to extinction from the diffusion approximation may differ significantly from simulated ones and that the amount and direction of the error in the approximation is not systematic. Given that this error is unpredictable and may be very sensitive to the exact demographic rates. we believe that the diffusion approximation should be used with caution as a basis for assessing extinction risk or making management decisions. 533:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In conservation biology it is necessary to make management decisions for endangered and threatened species under severe uncertainty. Failure to acknowledge and treat uncertainty can lead to poor decisions. To illustrate the importance of considering uncertainty we reanalyze a decision problem for the Sumatran rhino Dicerorhinus sumatrensis using information gap theory to propagate uncertainties and to rank management options. Rather than requiring information about the extent of parameter uncertainty at the outset information gap theory addresses the question of how much uncertainty can be tolerated before our decision would change. It assesses the robustness of decisions in the face of severe uncertainty. We show that different management decisions may result when uncertainty in utilities and probabilities are considered in decision making problems. We highlight the importance of a full assessment of uncertainty in conservation management decisions to avoid as much as possible undesirable outcomes. 541:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,543:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,543:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Models can be used to direct the management of population spread for the control of invasives or to encourage species of conservation value. Analytical models are attractive because of their theoretical basis and limited data requirements but there is concern that their simplicity may limit their practical utility. We address the applied use of simple models in a study of a declining annual herb Rhinanthus minor. We parameterized a population spread model using field data on demography and dispersal for four management systems: grazed only (GR) hay cut once (H1) hay cut twice (H2) and hay cut with autumn grazing (HG). Within a replicated experiment we measured spread rates of introduced R. minor populations over eight years. The modeled and measured spread rates were very similar in terms of both patterns of management effects and absolute values so that in both cases HG   H2 H1   GR. The treatments affected both dispersal and demography (establishment and survival) and so we used decomposition approaches to analyze the major causes of differences in population spread. Increased dispersal under hay cutting was more important than demographic changes and accounted for similar to 70 PeRcEnT of the differences in spread rate between the hay cut and grazed only treatments. Furthermore management effects on the tail of the dispersal curve were by far the most critical in governing spread. This study suggests that simple models can be used to inform practical conservation management and we demonstrate straightforward uses of our model to predict the impacts of different management strategies. While simple models can give accurate projections we emphasize that they must be parameterized with high quality data gathered at the appropriate spatial scale. 544:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Models of the geographic distributions of species have wide application in ecology. But the nonspatial single level regression models that ecologists have often employed do not deal with problems of irregular sampling intensity or spatial dependence and do not adequately quantify uncertainty. We show here how to build statistical models that can handle these features of spatial prediction and provide richer more powerful inference about species niche relations distributions and the effects of human disturbance. We begin with a familiar generalized linear model and build in additional features including spatial random effects and hierarchical levels. Since these models are fully specified statistical models we show that it is possible to add complexity without sacrificing interpretability. This step by step approach together with attached code that implements a simple spatially explicit regression model is structured to facilitate self teaching. All models are developed in a Bayesian framework. We assess the performance of the models by using them to predict the distributions of two plant species (Proteaceae) from South Africas Cape Floristic Region. We demonstrate that making distribution models spatially explicit can be essential for accurately characterizing the environmental response of species predicting their probability of occurrence and assessing uncertainty in the model results. Adding hierarchical levels to the models has further advantages in allowing human transformation of the landscape to be taken into account as well as additional features of the sampling process. 545:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most methods for modeling species distributions from occurrence records require additional data representing the range of environmental conditions in the modeled region. These data called background or pseudo absence data are usually drawn at random from the entire region whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. We therefore explore the use of all occurrences within a target group as biased background data. We compare model performance using target group background and randomly sampled background on a comprehensive collection of data for 226 species from diverse regions of the world. We find that target group background improves average performance for all the modeling methods we consider with the choice of background data having as large an effect on predictive performance as the choice of modeling method. The performance improvement due to target group background is greatest when there is strong bias in the target group presence records. Our approach applies to regression based modeling methods that have been adapted for use with occurrence data such as generalized linear or additive models and boosted regression trees and to Maxent a probability density estimation method. We argue that increased awareness of the implications of spatial bias in surveys and possible modeling remedies will substantially improve predictions of species distributions. 555:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Small populations are often at risk of extinction through processes that are effectively stochastic. Prediction of this extinction risk requires that the observed temporal variation in demographic rates be accurately partitioned between demographic stochasticity (variation among individuals) and environmental stochasticity (variation among years correlated across individuals). However studies of population viability analysis that include both forms of stochasticity parameterize the magnitude of environmental stochasticity incorrectly (they overestimate it). I describe and evaluate tests (1) to determine whether all the year to year variation in observed survivorship can be explained by demographic stochasticity alone and (2) if not to estimate the magnitude of environmental stochasticity in survival. The first issue can be resolved with a G test. I used simulated data to show that this test has an appropriate type I error rate unless the individual survival probability is either very low or very high. Small amounts of environmental stochasticity often are not detected by the G test (type II error) but the hypothesis of demographic stochasticity alone is consistently rejected when environmental stochasticity is large. In contrast estimating the magnitude of environmental stochasticity requires explicit hypotheses about the nature of the underlying variation but I provide a flexible framework in which many such hypotheses can be examined. In particular I show using simulated data that if the temporal variability in individual survival probabilities is distributed according to a beta distribution then the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance of the survival probability is biased but in a consistent and correctable way. The estimate obtained with my method is usually superior to an estimate that assumes that all of the variation in the observed survivorship is due to environmental stochasticity. I show how to include deterministic sources of variability such as density dependence and how to apply different assumptions about the underlying environmental stochasticity. I illustrate these tests with data from a population of Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus). With these data I can determine that there is strong environmental stochasticity in juvenile survival whereas variation in adult survival can be explained either by density dependence or by weak environmental stochasticity. 559:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,55:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,569:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Uncertainty is pervasive in ecology where the difficulties of dealing with sources of uncertainty are exacerbated by variation in the system itself. Attempts at classifying uncertainty in ecology have for the most part focused exclusively on epistemic uncertainty. In this paper we classify uncertainty into two main categories: episternic uncertainty (uncertainty in determinate facts) and linguistic uncertainty (uncertainty in language). We provide a classification of sources of uncertainty under the two main categories and demonstrate how each impacts on applications in ecology and conservation biology. In particular we demonstrate the importance of recognizing the effect of linguistic uncertainty in addition to epistemic uncertainty in ecological applications. The significance to ecology and conservation biology of developing a clear understanding of the various types of uncertainty how they arise and how they might best be dealt with is highlighted. Finally we discuss the various general strategies for dealing with each type of uncertainty and offer suggestions for treating compounding uncertainty from a range of sources. 570:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding what determines a species range is a central objective in ecology and evolutionary biology. It has important applications for predicting species distributions and how they might respond to environmental perturbations. This paper describes a mechanistic approach to predict past and present distribution of the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) on Honshu Japan. We applied state of the art microclimate and animal biophysical behavioral models coupled with climate and vegetation data to estimate the distribution of potential range expansion under protection. We tested the model results against detailed empirical distribution data from the Ministry of the Environment for a five prefecture area in central Honshu. We also applied the models to time series land use cover maps to investigate the historical transitions in habitat suitability during 1947 1999 in the Arai Keinan region. This is the first time to our knowledge that mechanistic models have successfully predicted the landscape scale distribution of a mammal species in the absence of other animal species interactions such as predators. In this case animal energetics behavior plant interactions seem to be critical. Forest cover appears to be important in summer and winter for suitable serow habitats. The energetics model results indicate that the serow can overheat in some open environments in midday hours in summer. In winter simulation results suggested that forest cover provides effective refuge to avoid increased metabolic demands of cold temperatures and strong winds. The model simulations suggested that land use cover changes documented during 1947 1999 resulted in increased suitable serow habitat due to expanding forest cover from agricultural marginalization and ecological succession. The models provide a unique tool for estimating species range expansion under protection or for selecting suitable reintroduction sites. 577:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examined trends in abundance of four pelagic fish species (delta smelt longfin smelt striped bass and threadfin shad) in the upper San Francisco Estuary California USA over 40 years using Bayesian change point models. Change point models identify times of abrupt or unusual changes in absolute abundance (step changes) or in rates of change in abundance (trend changes). We coupled Bayesian model selection with linear regression splines to identify biotic or abiotic covariates with the strongest associations with abundances of each species. We then refitted change point models conditional on the selected covariates to explore whether those covariates could explain statistical trends or change points in species abundances. We also fitted a multispecies change point model that identified change points common to all species. All models included hierarchical structures to model data uncertainties including observation errors and missing covariate values. There were step declines in abundances of all four species in the early 2000s with a likely common decline in 2002. Abiotic variables including water clarity position of the 2 PeRcEnT isohaline (X2) and the volume of freshwater exported from the estuary explained some variation in species abundances over the time series but no selected covariates could explain statistically the post 2000 change points for any species. 581:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This book the last work of the late mathematician and engineer Hans G. Natke promotes a comprehensive systems theoretical approach to the activity of model building in science with examples taken from disciplines ranging from population biology to economics sociology and engineering. The work of a leading systems scientists the book guides the reader through the fundamentals of model building laying out a taxonomy of analytical approaches to the construction of the __system maps__ we call models clarifying their relationship with the set of original hypotheses and exploring the fundamental issues in model verification validation and system identification with a swift and steady pace that never compromises clarity. While the scope of the book remains introductory the book does touch on more advanced topics like decision making and time variant models making for a reasonably complete introduction that many will find useful. No new theory or approaches are presented in this book whose natural role is that of a compendium of introductory systems theory suitable for use as a textbook. The major rationale for the existence of the book seems to be its multi disciplinary scope evident in the title as well as in the choice of examples and case studies. In this sense the reader of Ecological Economics should not expect the book to break any new ground in pointing out conceptual instruments or mathematical tools that can facilitate interdisciplinary dialogue. Whereas the book does draw examples from several disciplines many of which are indeed struggling to find common conceptual grounds and points out common theoretical aspects in the abstract view of the respective systems of interest one would be hard pressed to find methodologies criteria or even definitions that add substantially to the limited bag of tools at the disposal of the interdisciplinary scientist. The reader should be aware that multi disciplinary and inter disciplinary are indeed different words a semantic distinction that the book whose approach is based on the artificial simplicity of linearized systems sometimes confuses. I do find truth in the fact often repeated in the book that conceptual toolkits such as systems theory can be highly useful for model formalization in several fields and that scientists that operate in any of these fields should therefore be conversant with it. Nevertheless I find some disappointment in the fact that the book title seems to hold more promise for an analysis of the vocabulary and grammar of cross disciplinary dialogue than the contents in fact warrant. The main source of skepticism in my reading of this book is the attempt to promote the instrument of systems theory__an established useful but also limited discipline as seen in the fact that as the author remarks it can hardly deal with nonlinearity__as a unifying metanarrative. So I tend to read some of the conclusive sections of the book like the proposal for a quantitative aesthetics sketched in Chapter 7 as unlikely and rather stretched attempts to identify a synthetic paradigm ranking somewhere between mildly interesting and downright pointless. The use of systems theory promoted by Natke is legitimate as an attempt to identify a conceptual vocabulary that can enable and support a multi disciplinary conversation. Nevertheless I am left with the feeling that the modernist faith that pervades the book constitutes its main problem__at least as much as its main strength. The risk I see in embracing the books proposal of stretching the bounded depth of mathematical systems analysis to cover the unbounded complexity of multi disciplinary scientific problems is that of overlooking the unexplained tagging as noise all the aspects__like the extreme complexities of coupled multiple scale human__natural systems__that systems science as presented cannot even begin to describe. I think the value of the book would only be enhanced by an admission that even the formal aspects of a language that is suitable for multi disciplinary investigation are far richer than systems theory can provide. Also the multi disciplinary dialogue fostered by this book will not see its chances increased by the fact that many domain scientists do not have enough mathematical background to be able to follow it. This is not a book that can be profitably used or even appreciated by the mathematically challenged. Like many this book contains a mathematical refresher course in the appendix__an approach that I have rarely found useful. Despite this the book requires a serious investment on the part of the reader as well epitomized by the chapter dedications in German with no translation. A domain scientist in one of the disciplines of interest who does not deal with this level of formalism on an every day basis will probably find it hard to follow. On the other hand a reader with a good mathematical background and no overt expectations in terms of cross disciplinary analysis will find it a very useful and eminently practical compendium of systems theory for model building whose multi disciplinary focus does provide illuminating cross comparisons and has clear potential of deepening ones understanding. 58:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,5:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Models of population dynamics are commonly used to predict risks in ecology particularly risks of population decline. There is often considerable uncertainty associated with these predictions. However alternatives to predictions based on population models have not been assessed. We used simulation models of hypothetical species to generate the kinds of data that might typically be available to ecologists and then invited other researchers to predict risks of population declines using these data. The accuracy of the predictions was assessed by comparison with the forecasts of the original model. The researchers used either population models or subjective judgement to make their predictions. Predictions made using models were only slightly more accurate than subjective judgements of risk. However predictions using models tended to be unbiased while subjective judgements were biased towards over estimation. Psychology literature suggests that the bias of subjective judgements is likely to vary somewhat unpredictably among people depending on their stake in the outcome. This will make subjective predictions more uncertain and less transparent than those based on models. 602:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,603:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,605:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,607:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Exploratory modeling is an approach used when process and or parameter uncertainties are such that modeling attempts at realistic prediction are not appropriate. Exploratory modeling makes use of computational experimentation to test how varying model scenarios drive model outcome. The goal of exploratory modeling is to better understand the system of interest through delineation of plausible boundaries description of patterns within multidimensional model space and to the extent possible quantification of the likelihood of occurrence of different model outcomes. This study makes use of exploratory modeling in GIS to delineate boundaries of likely and plausible variability in past Oregon forests due to natural fire disturbance processes interacting with climate change and compares those with current forests modified by harvest disturbance and with a hypothetical forest scenario. The implications of different forest landscapes for biodiversity are quantified using a rule base constructed from empirical data describing forest age class elevation and heterogeneity requirements by species. Results show: 1) a wide range of natural forest structure plausibly existed in the past 2) portions of the current forest are outside of the most liberal models of the natural range of forest variability and 3) large changes in forest structure produce relatively small changes in biodiversity indicators. These findings suggest that disturbance processes (natural or human) that retain forested land cover but alter forest age class structure do not have a strong impact on biodiversity. As an exploratory exercise the findings are not the end objective; rather they serve as a basis for dialogue about which forest landscape factors are most important for assessment of biodiversity impacts. 608:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Research in ecology increasingly. relies on the integration of small focused studies to produce larger datasets that allow for more powerful synthetic analyses. The results of these synthetic analyses are critical in guiding decisions about how to sustainably manage our natural environment so it is important for researchers to effectively discover relevant data and appropriately integrate these within their analyses. However ecological data encompasses an extremely broad range of data types structures and semantic concepts. Moreover ecological data is widely distributed with few well established repositories or standard protocols for their archiving and retrieval. These factors make the discovery and integration of ecological data sets a highly labor intensive task. Metadata standards such as the Ecological Metadata Language and Darwin Core are important steps for improving our ability to discover and access ecological data but are limited to describing only a few relatively specific aspects of data content  data owner and contact information variable   names   keyword descriptions etc.). A more flexible and powerful way to capture the semantic subtleties of complex ecological data its structure and contents and the interrelationships among data variables is needed. We present a formal ontology for capturing the semantics of generic scientific observation and measurement. The ontology provides a convenient basis for adding detailed semantic annotations to scientific data which crystallize the inherent   meaning   of observational data. The ontology can be used to characterize the context of an observation  space and time) and clarify inter observational relationships such as dependency hierarchies  nested experimental observations) and meaningful dimensions within the data  axes for cross classified categorical summarization). It also enables the robust description of measurement units  grams of carbon per liter of seawater) and can facilitate automatic unit conversions  pounds to kilograms). The ontology can be easily extended with specialized domain vocabularies making it both broadly applicable and highly custornizable. Finally we describe the utility of the ontology for enriching the capabilities of data discovery and integration processes. 610:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Ecological Metadata Language is an effective specification for describing data for long term storage and interpretation When used in Conjunction with a metadata repository such as Metacat and a metadata editing tool such as Morpho. the Ecological Metadata Language allows a large community of researchers to access and to share their data Although the Ecological Metadata Language Morpho Metacat toolkit provides a rich data documentation mechanism Current methods for retrieving metadata described data can be laborious and time consuming Moreover. the structural and semantic heterogeneity of ecological data sets makes the development of custom solutions for integrating and querying these data prohibitively costly for large scale synthesis The Data Manager Library leverages the Ecological Metadata Language to provide automated data processing features that allow efficient data access querying. and manipulation without custom development. The library can be used for many data management tasks and was designed to be immediately useful as well as extensible and easy to incorporate within existing applications. In this paper we describe the motivation for developing the Data Manager Library provide an overview of its implementation. illustrate ideas for potential use by describing several planned and existing deployments and describe future work to extend the library  612:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With the advent of affordable yet powerful handheld computers many ecologists now capture data electronically in the field while avoiding transcription errors found in more traditional field notebook or slate based approaches of recording data. Ecologists either use simple forms from generic handheld software that doesnt allow for needed optimizations or else they must spend substantial effort in the design and optimization of handheld software user interfaces. These efforts often produce highly customized software that is not easily repurposed and that produce non standard undocumented data formats. Our research is focused on reducing this effort by providing a flexible framework that uses highly structured metadata to drive the generation of customized data entry interfaces. our approach relies on formalized metadata encoded in either XML Schema or XML instance documents which facilitate the creation of graphical interfaces from arbitrary data schemas. Specifically we leverage the rich metadata descriptions and structures found in the Ecological Metadata Language to create data entry forms and output data sets that adhere to this specification. The interfaces are refined by using data typing and domain information found in the structured metadata to generate validation routines that assist in maintaining data integrity during the entry process. The framework utilizes a rule based engine to promote both reuse and extensibility of the modules that are created for any given data entry effort. Interfaces are rendered using open Internet based standards to maintain portability and to advocate the sharing of software components. The framework represents an initial implementation of a customizable user interface generator which should have broad applicability to researchers in need of rapidly creating field and laboratory based forms for varied collection efforts. 613:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A classification of spatial simulation models of fire and vegetation dynamics (landscape fire succession models or LFSMs) is presented. The classification was developed to provide a foundation for comparing models and to help identify the appropriate fire and vegetation processes and their simulation to include in coarse scale dynamic global vegetation models. Other uses include a decision tool for research and management applications and a vehicle to interpret differences between LFSMs. The classification is based on the four primary processes that influence fire and vegetation dynamics: fire ignition fire spread fire effects and vegetation succession. Forty four LFSMs that explicitly simulated the four processes were rated by the authors and the modelers on a scale from 0 to 10 for their inherent degree of stochasticity complexity and mechanism for each of the four processes. These ratings were then used to group LFSMs into similar classes using common ordination and clustering techniques. Another database was created to describe each LFSM using selected keywords for over 20 explanatory categories. This database and the ordination and clustering results were then used to create the final LFSM classification that contains 12 classes and a corresponding key. The database and analysis results were used to construct a second classification key so managers can pick the most appropriate model for their application based on computer resources available modeling expertise and management objective. 618:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Increasing use is being made in conservation management of statistical models that couple extensive collections of species and environmental data to make predictions of the geographic distributions of species. While the relationships fitted between a species and its environment are relatively transparent for many of these modeling techniques others are more black box in character only producing geographic predictions and providing minimal or untraditional summaries of the fitted relationships on which these predictions are based. This in turn prevents robust evaluation of the ecological sensibility of such models a necessary process if model predictions are to be treated with confidence. Here we propose a new but simple method for visualizing modeled responses that can be implemented with any modeling method and demonstrate its application using five common methods applied to the prediction of an Australian tree species. This is achieved by insetting an   evaluation strip   into the spatial data layers which after predictions have been made can be clipped out and used for creating plots of the modelled responses. We present findings of the application strip for algorithms GLMs GAMs CLIM DOMAIN and MARS. Evaluation strips can be constructed to investigate either uni variate responses or the simultaneous variation in predicted values in relation to two variables. The latter option is particularly useful for evaluating responses in models that allow the fitting of complex interaction terms. 619:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Lifemapper (http: www.lifemapper.org) is a predictive electronic atlas of the Earths biological biodiversity.

In many cases researchers faced with the task of constructing such maps are aware of problems with the modelling data and of decisions that they make within the modelling process that are likely to affect the output but they find it difficult to quantify this information. In some cases they attempt to evaluate the modelled predictions against independent data but the summary statistics have no spatial component and do not address errors in the predictions. It is proposed that maps of uncertainty would help in the interpretation of these summaries and to emphasize patterns in uncertainty such as spatial clustering or links with particular covariates. This paper reviews the aspects of uncertainty that are relevant to habitat maps developed with logistic regression and suggests methods for investigating and communicating these uncertainties. It addresses the problems of subjective judgement model uncertainty and vague concepts along with the more commonly considered uncertainties of random and systematic error. Methods for developing realistic confidence intervals are presented along with suggestions on how to visualize the information for use by decision makers. 622:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Objectively assessing the performance of a model and deriving model parameter values from observations are critical and challenging in landscape to regional modeling. In this paper we applied a nonlinear inversion technique to calibrate the ecosystem model CENTURY against carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stock measurements collected from 39 mature tropical forest sites in seven life zones in Costa Rica. Net primary productivity from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) C and N stocks in aboveground live biomass litter coarse woody debris (CWD) and in soils were used to calibrate the model. To investigate the resolution of available observations on the number of adjustable parameters inversion was performed using nine setups of adjustable parameters. Statistics including observation sensitivity parameter correlation coefficient parameter sensitivity and parameter confidence limits were used to evaluate the information content of observations resolution of model parameters and overall model performance. Results indicated that soil organic carbon content soil nitrogen content and total aboveground biomass carbon had the highest information contents while measurements of carbon in litter and nitrogen in CWD contributed little to the parameter estimation processes. The available information could resolve the values of 2 4 parameters. Adjusting just one parameter resulted in under fitting and unacceptable model performance while adjusting five parameters simultaneously led to over fitting. Results further indicated that the MODIS NPP values were compressed as compared with the spatial variability of net primary production (NPP) values infer red from inverse modeling. Using inverse modeling to infer NPP and other sensitive model parameters from C and N stock observations provides an opportunity to utilize data collected by national to regional forest inventory systems to reduce the uncertainties in the carbon cycle and generate valuable databases to validate and improve MODIS NPP algorithms. 623:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One often develops stochastic ecologic simulation models based on local interactions between individuals or groups and bases systemic conclusions on trends summarized over multiple data sets generated from the model. In many cases such models generate data sets (  realizations  ) each violating the usual assumptions associated with traditional statistical tests of c goodness of fit most notably that of independent observations. Monte Carlo hypothesis tests applied to multiple realizations from such models provide appropriate goodness of fit tests regardless of within model peculiarities. The Monte Carlo tests address the question   Do the observed data appear consistent with the model?   in contrast to the usual question   Does the model appear consistent with the observed data?  . In addition such tests can make use of the same data sets used to draw systemic inference  the tests require no additional simulation runs). We illustrate the concept using Pearsons chi square statistic with correlated data. We also consider the behavior of a similar statistic and of   modeling efficiency   in assessing the fit of a simulation model for the spatial spread of raccoon rabies in Connecticut. 624:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Planning land use for biodiversity conservation frequently involves computer assisted reserve selection algorithms. Typically such algorithms operate on matrices of species presence absence in sites or on species specific distributions of model predicted probabilities of occurrence in grid cells. There are practically always errors in input data erroneous species presence absence data structural and parametric uncertainty in predictive habitat models and lack of correspondence between temporal presence and long run persistence. Despite these uncertainties typical reserve selection methods proceed as if there is no uncertainty in the data or models. Having two conservation options of apparently equal biological value one would prefer the option whose value is relatively insensitive to errors in planning inputs. In this work we show how uncertainty analysis for reserve planning can be implemented within a framework of information gap decision theory generating reserve designs that are robust to uncertainty. Consideration of uncertainty involves modifications to the typical objective functions used in reserve selection. Search for robust optimal reserve structures can still be implemented via typical reserve selection optimization techniques including stepwise heuristics integer programming and stochastic global search. 625:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,625:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Range expansion rates vary by species habitat and time since initiation. These speeds are a key issue in the analysis of biological invasions and a wide variety of mathematical models address them. Many such models may provide an adequate estimate of invasion speeds and hence an adequate qualitative fit to spread data. In general however because of flexibility in choice of dispersal kernels integrodifference equation (IDE) Models are superior to reaction diffusion (RD) models when spread rates increase through time. Nevertheless additional differences in model complexity may arise through different approaches for dealing with habitat and temporal variability. This diversity of potential methodologies suggests the need for quantitative model selection criteria although to our knowledge IDE models have not been compared to RD models with diffusion that varies in space and time. To demonstrate our approach for choosing between a suite of spatially explicit models that vary in complexity; we use the classic California sea otter range expansion data and the Akaike Information Criterion which balances fit and parsimony. Our results show that the increasing speeds in the otter range expansion overwhelmingly support an IDE model for characterizing the entire data set. When focusing on certain stages of the range expansion however the more parsimonious reaction diffusion model can provide the best description. Thus the ideal spatial modeling framework can depend upon the temporal scale of the question. 628:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP) is one of several current approaches to modeling species distributions using occurrence records and environmental data. Because of stochastic elements in the algorithm and underdetermination of the system (multiple solutions with the same value for the optimization criterion) no unique solution is produced. Furthermore current implementations of GARP utilize only presence data rather than both presence and absence the more general case. Hence variability among GARP models which is typical of genetic algorithms and complications in interpreting results based on asymmetrical (presence only) input data make model selection critical. Generally some locality records are randomly selected to build a distributional model with others set aside to evaluate it. Here we use intrinsic and extrinsic measures of model performance to determine whether optimal models can be identified based on objective intrinsic criteria without resorting to an independent test data set. We modeled potential distributions of two rodents (Heteromys anomalus and Microryzomys minutus) and one passerine bird (Carpodacus mexicanus) creating 20 models for each species. For each model we calculated intrinsic and extrinsic measures of omission and commission error as well as composite indices of overall error. Although intrinsic and extrinsic composite measures of overall model performance were sometimes loosely related to each other none was consistently associated with expert judged model quality. In contrast intrinsic and extrinsic measures were highly correlated for both omission and commission in the two widespread species (H. anomalus and C mexicanus). Furthermore a clear inverse relationship existed between omission and commission there and the best models were consistently found at low levels of omission and moderate to high commission values. In contrast all models for M. minutus showed low values of both omission and commission. Because models are based only on presence data (and not all areas are adequately sampled) the corm nission index reflects not only true commission error but also a component that results from undersampled areas that the species actually inhabits. We here propose an operational procedure for determining an optimal region of the omission commission relationship and thus selecting high quality GARP models. Our implementation of this technique for H. anomalus gave a much more reasonable estimation of the species potential distribution than did the original suite of models. These findings are relevant to evaluation of other distributional modeling techniques based on presence only data and should also be considered with other machine learning applications modified for use with asymmetrical input data. 631:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, WhyWhere is a new ecological niche modeling (ENM) algorithm for mapping and explaining the distribution of species. The algorithm uses image processing methods to efficiently sift through large amounts of data to find the few variables that best predict species occurrence. The purpose of this paper is to describe and justify the main parameterizations and to show preliminary success at rapidly providing accurate scalable and simple ENMs. Preliminary results for six species of plants and animals in different regions indicate a significant (p   0.01) 14 PeRcEnT increase in accuracy over the GARP algorithm using models with few typically two variables. The increase is attributed to access to additional data particularly remotely sensed monthly versus annual climate averages. WhyWhere is also six times faster than GARP on large datasets.

Conversely population viability analysis (PVA) modelers have increased the sophistication and complexity of their approaches but most do not adequately address parameter and model uncertainties in viability assessments or include important ecological drivers. Merging the advances in these two fields could enable more defensible predictions of extinction risk and better evaluations of management options but only if clear and interpretable PVA results can be distilled from these complex analyses and outputs. Here we provide guidance on how to successfully conduct such a combined analysis using the example of the endangered island fox (Urocyon littoralis) endemic to the Channel Islands of California USA. This more rigorous demographic PVA was built by forming a close marriage between the statistical models used to estimate parameters from raw data and the details of the subsequent PVA simulation models. In particular the use of mark recapture analyses and other likelihood and information theoretic methods allowed us to carefully incorporate parameter and model uncertainty the effects of ecological drivers density dependence and other complexities into our PVA. Island fox populations show effects of density dependence predation and El Nino events as well as substantial unexplained temporal variation in survival rates. Accounting not only for these sources of variability but also for uncertainty in the models and parameters used to estimate their strengths proved important in assessing fox viability with different starting population sizes and predation levels. While incorporating ecological drivers into PVA assessments can help to predict realistic dynamics we also show that unexplained process variance has important effects even in our extremely well studied system and therefore must not be ignored in PVAs. Overall the treatment of causal factors and uncertainties in parameter values and model structures need not result in unwieldy models or highly complex predictions and we emphasize that future PVAs can and should include these effects when suitable data are available to support their analysis. 633:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Data characteristics and species traits are expected to influence the accuracy with which species distributions can be modeled and predicted. We compare 10 modeling techniques in terms of predictive power and sensitivity to location error change in map resolution and sample size and assess whether some species traits can explain variation in model performance. We focused on 30 native tree species in Switzerland and used presence only data to model current distribution which we evaluated against independent presence absence data. While there are important differences between the predictive performance of modeling methods the variance in model performance is greater among species than among techniques. Within the range of data perturbations in this study some extrinsic parameters of data affect model performance more than others: location error and sample size reduced performance of many techniques whereas grain had little effect on most techniques. No technique can rescue species that are difficult to predict. The predictive power of species distribution models can partly be predicted from a series of species characteristics and traits based on growth rate elevational distribution range and maximum elevation. Slow growing species or species with narrow and specialized niches tend to be better modeled. The Swiss presence only tree data produce models that are reliable enough to be useful in planning and management applications. 635:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution which is characterized by means variances and other statistical moments. Here we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time series data using first order multivariate autoregressive (MAk(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics. 640:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for Populations that exhibit regular oscillations in density there are several biological mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles; but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence: (1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation); (2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids) and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each model to three long term Population time series in Britain that exhibit some degree of regular cycling and we used parametric bootstrap to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three forests: at Culbin the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit equally well; at Roseisle the food quality and maternal effects models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir the parasitoid model fit best. However the best fit parasitism models required that the parasitism rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle greatly exceeding the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field. In contrast the required variation in the observable maternal quality variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations. Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location) the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal effects model then had uniformly strong support outperforming the constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidence. 642:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,646:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,646:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One gauge of the maturity of a scientific discipline is the extent to which results are synthesized across studies to test and refine the conceptual foundation of the discipline. Over the past three to four decades as field experiments have become entrenched as a primary ecological tool experimental results have flooded the literature. This vast literature has been treated in three different ways by most authors trying to summarize the state of the field: (1) as a large pool from which a small number of exemplars are selected to illustrate particular ecological principles; (2) as a source for narrative qualitative reviews as well as the discussions of most primary research papers; or (3) as a database from which to conduct semiquantitative reviews using votecounting procedures. Reaction in other fields to the problems with all of these approaches has led to the development of formal statistical techniques for meta analysis the quantitative synthesis and analysis of a collection of experimental studies. Although meta analysis holds great promise for addressing ecological questions that cannot be resolved by single studies its future role in ecology remains uncertain. As a result we convened a working group at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (Santa Barbara California USA) to help evaluate and guide the application of meta analysis to ecological questions. This Special Feature represents a summary of some of our findings and is intended to stimulate additional research into the development of meta analytic approaches appropriate to resolving ecological questions and furthering the development and testing of ecological theory. Many important issues relating to meta analysis have been discussed in the literature of other disciplines  medicine sociology psychology). However borrowing too heavily from other disciplines may mislead ecologists; we tend to study more diverse systems ask more diverse questions and use more diverse experimental methods than do the human focused disciplines in which meta analytical techniques have been developed. Therefore this Special Feature tackles issues that are ecological in nature and not illustrated or necessarily available in the existing literature on meta analysis. In the first paper Osenberg . set the stage by discussing the first and most critical step in any meta analysis: the specification of the question and therefore the definition of effect size. They argue that resolving ecological questions will demand approaches that move beyond null hypothesis tests and statistically based metrics toward greater reliance on estimation of the magnitudes of ecological response. Defining appropriate measures of effect size will often require specification of a biological model. However ecologists will not always have sufficient information to choose an appropriate model and therefore may need to rely on other considerations for choosing measures of effect size. Goldberg . describe a set of empirical criteria for making such choices and illustrate these issues by evaluating whether the intensity of competition among plants intensifies as primary production increases. Once the problem and metric have been specified data must be selected for analysis. By comparing the results of meta analyses in which data were selected using different sets of criteria Englund . illustrate that the conclusions of a meta analysis can be seriously influenced by peripheral decisions used to select data or studies. They recommend that meta analytic patterns be examined for their robustness to changes in selection criteria and they caution against the use of criteria that relate to the perceived quality of studies because of the potential for unconscious bias. With question metric and data in hand the meta analyst must consider statistical issues. One consideration arises because data used in meta analysis have two sources of variation: variation among studies in the true effect and variation arising from error in measuring the effect for any given study. The within study error term may be more heterogeneous in meta analyses than in primary studies due to differences in methodology and design. Thus as Gurevitch and Hedges discuss weighted analyses that rely on these estimates of variances are recommended. Separately estimating these sources of variance also can provide a means to test hypotheses about the consistency of the effect size among experiments. Estimation of effect sizes and variance components however requires access to appropriately summarized data. Often only statistical test results are given  reported as P values or ANOVA tables) or the data are summarized but in ways that preclude calculation of effect sizes and withinstudy variances. Indeed poor reporting of primary data is often the greatest impediment to conducting a meta analysis. The Ecological Society of America has addressed this need by creating Ecological Archives where primary data and meta analysis data sets can be permanently archived. To facilitate future meta analyses derived from the data used in this Special Feature all authors have archived their data in ESAs Electronic Data Archive Ecological Archives E080 005 through E080 009.We hope this becomes a common practice. The statistical procedures that exist for meta analysis assume that estimates of effect size are independent; an assumption that is likely to be violated in most ecological meta analyses when multiple estimates are taken from a single paper particular investigators contribute many papers on a topic or certain habitats or taxa are disproportionately represented in the literature. It is also likely that nonindependence arising from phylogenetic history and publication bias will further affect the universe to which the results have relevance. Although these issues were discussed extensively by the working group and peripherally addressed in several of the papers these topics demand further investigation and will certainly be a source of controversy in ecology as they have been in other fields. Aside from these general considerations of statistical inference application of meta analysis to any specific problem requires an understanding of the statistical properties of the chosen metric. Often ecologists use metrics whose statistical properties are not well known. In such cases the statistical properties must be specified so that efficient and unbiased estimators can be obtained and the domain of their applicability specified. Hedges . illustrate these issues with response ratios which underlie a family of metrics commonly used by ecologists. Finally Downing . provide an illuminating example of ecological meta analysis using data on the effects of nutrients on production of marine phytoplankton. Their results illustrate the importance of time scale in interpreting ecological data and demonstrate that current understanding of nutrient limitation in the worlds oceans is biased in part by nonrandom selection of study sites and by spatial variation in the magnitude by which algal production is limited by different nutrients. This Special Feature is hardly an exhaustive or definitive treatment of the role and application of meta analysis in ecology. It does however provide an initial foundation for ecologists seeking to apply meta analysis to their questions and more generally should help to define the role of synthesis in ecology. Meta analysis in combination with ecological theory and a collection of well executed primary studies helps us describe patterns of variation in responses test ideas designed to explain these patterns and generate new hypotheses when existing theory fails. In this light meta analysis__and quantitative synthesis in general__is a central and indispensable part of the scientific method. We hope this Special Feature will stimulate the development of better tools for applying meta analysis in ecology and thus improve quantitative syntheses as well as the primary studies whose quality ultimately constrains the insights gained from synthesis. 655:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A new test based on the generalized additive model is proposed to investigate density dependent mortality in the juvenile cohorts of cod. Density dependence implies that the function linking the count of a cohort in one year to the count in the succeeding year is convex. The method estimates (without functional assumptions) the function linking the two counts and provides a level of significance for any convexity. We investigate the power and bias of the new test on the basis of simulated data. The power compares well with a test of unit slope in a log log plot (although it is usually somewhat lower). However in contrast to the latter method the test for convexity is much more resistant to measurement error. We applied the model to long term survey data from two areas of the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. In both cases the variance is intermediate between the Gamma (variance proportional to the squared mean) and the Poisson (variance proportional to the mean) distributions. A negative binomial (with k approximate to 3.5) describes the variance well. The variance is interpreted as resulting from sampling errors spatial heterogeneity and environmental stochasticity. Incorporating this error structure the optimal models linking the two main juvenile stages are for each area nonlinear and significantly convex (P   0.05). The full models are highly significant (P   0.001) and the examination of the residuals does not reveal any remaining structure. We conclude that the survival of juvenile cod along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast is density dependent probably because of cannibalism competition for habitat and food limitation. The functional form of density dependence in the per capita survival rate is estimated to be approximately log linear. 658:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,666:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,68:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,6:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,6:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Several methods used in fisheries stock assessment models that can be applied to population viability analysis are presented. (1) Integrated analysis allows the use of all information on a particular population and ensures that all model assumptions and parameter are consistent throughout the analysis that uncertainty is propagated throughout the analysis and that the correlation among parameters is preserved. (2) Bayesian analysis allows for the inclusion of prior information and is a convenient way to represent uncertainty. (3) Random effects models based on hierarchical modeling allow information to be shared among parameter estimates and allow the separation of process error from estimation error. (4) Non parametric representation of parameters allows for a more flexible relationship among the parameters. (5) Robust likelihood functions provide an automatic method to reduce the influence of outliers when the data sets are large. These methods are applied to artificial data sets provided by the Extinction Risk Working Group of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) using AD Model Builder software (Otter Research(TM)). 702:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, How best to predict the effects of perturbations to ecological communities has been a long standing goal for both applied and basic ecology. This quest has recently been revived by new empirical data new analysis methods and increased computing speed with the promise that ecologically important insights may be obtainable from a limited knowledge of community interactions. We use empirically based and simulated networks of varying size and connectance to assess two limitations to predicting perturbation responses in multispecies communities: (1) the inaccuracy by which species interaction strengths are empirically quantified and (2) the indeterminacy of species responses due to indirect effects associated with network size and structure. We find that even modest levels of species richness and connectance (similar to 25 pairwise interactions) impose high requirements for interaction strength estimates because system indeterminacy rapidly overwhelms predictive insights. Nevertheless even poorly estimated interaction strengths provide greater average predictive certainty than an approach that uses only the sign of each interaction. Our simulations provide guidance in dealing with the trade offs involved in maximizing the utility of network approaches for predicting dynamics in multispecies communities. 705:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In experimental population ecology there is often a gap between realistic models used to hypothesize about population dynamics and statistical models used to analyze data. Ecologists routinely conduct experiments where the data from each replicate are short time series of estimated population abundances structured by stage species and or other information and the conventional test for treatment effects uses a general linear model (GLM) such as analysis of variance (ANOVA). However GLMs do not incorporate demographic relationships between abundances through time. An alternative is to use population dynamics models as frameworks for statistical hypothesis testing. This approach requires general methods for fitting structured population models that can incorporate both process noise (stochastic dynamics) and observation error (inaccurate data). This paper presents such methods and compares them to GLMs for testing population dynamics hypotheses from experiments. The methods are Monte Carlo state space likelihood methods including a basic Monte Carlo integration method and a recently developed Monte Carlo kernel likelihood method. Three simulated examples of population dynamics experiments were used to compare analysis with a population model to ANOVA analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and repeated measures ANOVA. The examples considered manipulations of host plant growth conditions causing decreased survival and increased fecundity; predator addition to investigate a behaviorally mediated change in prey demography; and changed host plant growth conditions with a more complex model for herbivore dynamics than the one used for analysis. For the first example a population model gave much higher statistical power than any of the ANOVA methods and provides greater biological insight. For the second example ANOVA models are not suited to test for the behavioral effect but a population model detected it with high statistical power. The third example suggests that even incorrect biological structure can provide better inferences than omitting all biological structure. The likelihood methods presented here make analysis with structured population models feasible for a wide range of models incorporating process noise and observation error thus offering higher statistical power and greater biological insight for population dynamics experiments. 717:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Meta analysis is the use of statistical methods to summarize research findings across studies. Special statistical methods are usually needed for meta analysis both because effect size indexes are typically highly heteroscedastic and because it is desirable to be able to distinguish between study variance from within study sampling error variance. We outline a number of considerations related to choosing methods for the meta analysis of ecological data including the choice of parametric vs. resampling methods reasons for conducting weighted analyses where possible and comparisons fixed vs. mixed models in categorical and regression type analyses. 724:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One commonly used PVA (population viability analysis) approach applies a diffusion approximation (DA) of population growth to time series of abundance data to estimate population parameters and various metrics of extinction risk. The simplest versions of this PVA assume density independent population growth an assumption that is commonly called into question for populations experiencing self limitation. Using time series data generated from simulations of populations limited by three commonly used forms of density dependence (ceiling Beverton Holt and Ricker) we asked the question:   When do simple density independent PVA models provide useful guidelines for prioritizing extinction risk despite density dependence inherent in the underlying real populations?   Simple DA methods severely underestimated maximum growth rates (mu(max)) used to generate time series data for all three forms of density dependence. These methods also underestimated the intrinsic environmental variability in growth rates or process error (sigma(2)) for the ceiling model but overestimated this parameter for the Beverton Holt and Ricker models. Despite misestimation of the intrinsic parameters the estimated probabilities of 50 PeRcEnT and 75 PeRcEnT declines were highly correlated with the observed probabilities for populations growing with a ceiling (coefficients of correlation or R 2 equals 0.87 0.93). DA methods were less accurate for populations exhibiting more complex forms of density dependence (R 2 equals 0.61 0.79). Although correlations between observed and estimated risks were high bias  over and underestimation) was extensive. Estimated probabilities of 50 PeRcEnT declines were typically much lower (overly optimistic) than observed probabilities of the same decline. By contrast accuracy increased substantially for predictions of 75 PeRcEnT decline and the   optimistic   bias was replaced by conservative bias (overestimates of risk). Regardless of the form of density dependence estimates of risk were least accurate when populations were recovering rapidly but were much more accurate when most needed by conservation practitioners: when the population fluctuated near its carrying capacity recovered slowly to this abundance level or declined toward extinction. Finally when we classified risk in broad categories  extremely low low moderate high and extremely high) DA methods correctly or conservatively estimated the risk of a 75 PeRcEnT decline for  85 PeRcEnT of the parameter combinations regardless of the form of density dependence followed by the real population. 736:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most studied populations however scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles Over the past three decades theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary and heretofore mostly independent quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles using both long term population time series and the often rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time series data using modern statistical techniques Finally we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series using a variety of statistical descriptors which we refer to collectively as   probes.   The model most similar to the data as measured by these probes is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of Nicholsons blowfly populations in which we know the   true   governing mechanism. Our analysis which uses only a subset of the information available about the population uncovers the correct answer suggesting that this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as well. 789:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We describe and test a method for fitting noisy differential equation models to a time series of Population counts motivated by stage structured models of insect and zooplankton populations. We consider semimechanistic models in which the model structure is derived from knowledge of the life cycle but the rate equations are estimated nonparametrically from the time series data. The method involves smoothing the population time series x(t) in order to estimate the gradient dx dt and then fitting rate equations using penalized regression splines. Computer intensive methods are used to estimate and remove the biases that result from the data being discrete time samples with sampling errors from a continuous time process. Semimechanistic modeling makes it possible to test assumptions about the mechanisms behind population fluctuations without the results being confounded by possibly arbitrary choices of parametric forms for process rate equations. To illustrate this application we analyze time series data on laboratory populations of blowflies Lucilia cuprina and Lucilia sericata. The models assume that the populations are limited by competition among adults affecting their current birth and death rates. The results cot respond to the actual experimental conditions. For L. cuprina (where the models structure is appropriate) a good fit can be obtained while for L. sericata (where the model is inappropriate) the fitted model does not reproduce some major features of the observed cycles. A documented set of R functions for all steps in the model fitting process is provided as a supplement to this article. 790:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We evaluate the goals of meta analysis critique its recent application in ecology and highlight an approach that more explicitly links meta analysis and ecological theory. One goal of meta analysis is testing null hypotheses of no response to experimental manipulations. Many ecologists however are more interested in quantitatively measuring processes and examining their systematic variation across systems and conditions. This latter goal requires a suite of diverse ecologically based metrics of effect size with each appropriately matched to an ecological question of interest. By specifying ecological models we can develop metrics of effect size that quantify the underlying process or response of interest and are insensitive to extraneous factors irrelevant to the focal question. A model will also help to delineate the set of studies that fit the question addressed by the meta analysis. We discuss factors that can give rise to heterogeneity in effect sizes  due to differences in experimental protocol parameter values or the structure of the models that describe system dynamics) and illustrate this variation using some simple models of plant competition. Variation in time scale will be one of the most common factors affecting a meta analysis by introducing heterogeneity in effect sizes. Different metrics will apply to different time scales and time series data will be vital in evaluating the appropriateness of different metrics to different collections of studies. We then illustrate the application of ecological models and associated metrics of effect size in meta analysis by discussing and or synthesizing data on species interactions mutual interference between consumers and individual physiology. We also examine the use of metrics when no single specific model applies to the synthesized studies. These examples illustrate that the diversity of ecological questions demands a diversity of ecologically meaningful metrics of effect size. The successful application of meta analysis in ecology will benefit by clear and explicit linkages among ecological theory the questions being addressed and the metrics used to summarize the available information. 810:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As we and Mangel point out there are essentially two types of numerical uncertainty one type can be removed with more data (epistemic uncertainty) and the other type cannot (natural variation or aleatory uncertainty). Biological ignorance sensu Mangel is simply a combination of these two types. In the context of choosing between management options the techniques we described in our paper can deal with both types of uncertainty. Probability bounds address both types of uncertainty explicitly in a probabilistic framework. Other bounding techniques such as interval and info gap analyses subsume both types of uncertainty within bounds. While we recognize that the mathematical notation for techniques such as info gap can be an initial challenge info gap is conceptually straightforward. The analysis of robustness using info gap simply asks: which is the best management option if the models parameters are x per cent worse than expected? By plotting the management outcome extinction probability vs. x for each management option one can find the option that provides an acceptable outcome and is at the same time most robust to uncertainty. Ignoring uncertainty can have profound implications. As pointed out in our paper management decisions can be suboptimal if uncertainty is ignored. Although we agree with Mangel that our criterion of metapopulation persistence  the species does not go extinct) is not particularly conservative for achieving fisheries management goals it is a reasonable minimum criterion for conservation and the approaches to evaluating uncertainty that we describe can easily be applied to fisheries population models if one wants to minimize the chance a stock falls below a certain level (or quasiextinction). What Mangel clearly exposes with his comment is that decision making under uncertainty is not always an objective problem that can be solved exclusively with scientific information. Management and conservation are necessarily value driven activities where people decide how much of something they want or are willing to risk losing. Is our objective to minimize the risk of a catastrophic outcome such as extinction or the risk of an unfavourable yield such as a poor harvest or a combination of the two? These are decisions that need to be hammered out during a problem definition phase which is often the hardest part of any environmental decision making. While different groups will define the problem in different ways dealing with this higher level of uncertainty problem definition uncertainty is beyond the scope of our work. The info gap model presented in our paper assumes a risk averse decision maker at the outset. Other methods of uncertainty analysis such as precise probability distributions and probability bounds require positions on acceptable levels of risk and attitudes to risk in order to make a final decision. But even when a decision is based upon a model no particular outcome can be guaranteed. Very low probability but high consequence events such as catastrophes are difficult to fully anticipate and account for in models. Mangel points this out when he states that even well managed systems can still crash . His point strengthens the case for using uncertainty modelling methods such as those presented in our paper. One can decide how resistant to uncertainty a management plan needs to be and then model appropriate management solutions. Tools for making decisions under uncertainty will perform better than methods that ignore the probability of such crashes. Finally we wish to clarify a point in Mangels response. In eqn 1 the parameter 1 b is the mean dispersal distance (and not simply dispersal distance as stated by Mangel). A lognormal probability distribution is constructed for b using the average and standard deviation of all the reciprocal mean dispersal distances for fishes in Kinlan and Gaines. Mangel is correct that in general the average of the reciprocal of a distribution is not the reciprocal of the average of the distribution. However we did not present the average of the mean dispersal distance (which from Kinlan and Gaines is 112 km and not 22 km as Mangel calculates). Rather we simply presented the mean dispersal distance that corresponds to the value b 0.05 or 1 b because that is how beta is defined. Although the treatment of uncertainty can seem daunting to incorporate into conservation planning people have long accepted it in many aspects of their daily lives. We fly in aeroplanes we drive across bridges and we manufacture and use chemicals. Engineers and risk assessors have figured out how to make these activities relatively safe for us despite the uncertainty inherent in such complex systems. We argue here that conservationists and resource managers can learn a lot from the techniques developed in these fields of research. The methods we present in our paper are not exhaustive. There is no single best tool for dealing with uncertainty the best choice will depend on the management context and the quality and quantity of data available. Most importantly such tools need to be integrated into management and conservation planning if we are to have any hope of making effective decisions. 834:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystems and the species and communities within them are highly complex systems that defy predictions with any degree of certainty. Managing and conserving these systems in the face of uncertainty remains a daunting challenge particularly with respect to developing networks of marine reserves. Here we review several modelling frameworks that explicitly acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty and then use these methods to evaluate reserve spacing rules given increasing levels of uncertainty about larval dispersal distances. Our approach finds similar spacing rules as have been proposed elsewhere roughly 20 200 km but highlights several advantages provided by uncertainty modelling over more traditional approaches to developing these estimates. In particular we argue that uncertainty modelling can allow for (1) an evaluation of the risk associated with any decision based on the assumed uncertainty; (2) a method for quantifying the costs and benefits of reducing uncertainty; and (3) a useful tool for communicating to stakeholders the challenges in managing highly uncertain systems. We also argue that incorporating rather than avoiding uncertainty will increase the chances of successfully achieving conservation and management goals. 837:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Forecasting population decline to a certain critical threshold (the quasi extinction risk) is one of the central objectives of population viability analysis (PVA) and such predictions figure prominently in the decisions of major conservation organizations. In this paper we argue that accurate forecasting of a populations quasi extinction risk does not necessarily require knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms. Because of the stochastic and multiplicative nature of population growth the ensemble behaviour of population trajectories converges to common statistical forms across a wide variety of stochastic population processes. This paper provides a theoretical basis for this argument. We show that the quasi extinction surfaces of a variety of complex stochastic population processes (including age structured density dependent and spatially structured populations) can be modelled by a simple stochastic approximation: the stochastic exponential growth process overlaid with Gaussian errors. Using simulated and real data we show that this model can be estimated with 20 30 years of data and can provide relatively unbiased quasi extinction risk with confidence intervals considerably smaller than (0 1). This was found to be true even for simulated data derived from some of the noisiest population processes (density dependent feedback species interactions and strong age structure cycling). A key advantage of statistical models is that their parameters and the uncertainty of those parameters can be estimated from time series data using standard statistical methods. In contrast for most species of conservation concern biologically realistic models must often be specified rather than estimated because of the limited data available for all the various parameters. Biologically realistic models will always have a prominent place in PVA for evaluating specific management options which affect a single segment of a population a single demographic rate or different geographic areas. However for forecasting quasi extinction risk statistical models that are based on the convergent statistical properties of population processes offer many advantages over biologically realistic models. 862:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P Matrix projection models are among the most widely used tools in plant ecology. However the way in which plant ecologists use and interpret these models differs from the way in which they are presented in the broader academic literature. In contrast to calls from earlier reviews most studies of plant populations are based on   5 matrices and present simple metrics such as deterministic population growth rates. However plant ecologists also cautioned against literal interpretation of model predictions. Although academic studies have emphasized testing quantitative model predictions such forecasts are not the way in which plant ecologists find matrix models to be most useful. Improving forecasting ability would necessitate increased model complexity and longer studies. Therefore in addition to longer term studies with better links to environmental drivers priorities for research include critically evaluating relative comparative uses of matrix models and asking how we can use many short term studies to understand long term population dynamics. 864:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P Two major approaches address the need to predict species distributions in response to environmental changes. Correlative models estimate parameters phenomenologically by relating current distributions to environmental conditions. By contrast mechanistic models incorporate explicit relationships between environmental conditions and organismal performance estimated independently of current distributions. Mechanistic approaches include models that translate environmental conditions into biologically relevant metrics  potential duration of activity) models that capture environmental sensitivities of survivorship and fecundity and models that use energetics to link environmental conditions and demography. We compared how two correlative and three mechanistic models predicted the ranges of two species: a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris) and a fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Correlative and mechanistic models performed similarly in predicting current distributions but mechanistic models predicted larger range shifts in response to climate change. Although mechanistic models theoretically should provide more accurate distribution predictions there is much potential for improving their flexibility and performance. 87:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,888:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The concept of a group is ubiquitous in biology. It underlies classifications in evolution and ecology including those used to describe phylogenetic levels the habitat and functional roles of organisms in ecosystems. Surprisingly this concept is not explicitly included in simple models for the structure of food webs the ecological networks formed by consumer resource interactions. We present here the simplest possible model based on groups and show that it performs substantially better than current models at predicting the structure of large food webs. Our group based model can be applied to different types of biological and non biological networks and for the first time merges in the same framework two important notions in network theory: that of compartments (sets of highly interacting nodes) and that of roles (sets of nodes that have similar interaction patterns). This model provides a basis to examine the significance of groups in biological networks and to develop more accurate models for ecological network structure. It is especially relevant at a time when a new generation of empirical data is providing increasingly large food webs. 931:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The great diversity of terrestrial plants testifies to a wide variety of life history strategies for dealing with the problem of surviving to reproduce in a stressful environment while competing with other biota. It is essential to develop an understanding of how global environmental changes are perturbing the distribution of species throughout the globe. However the most abundant collections of historic data on species distributions museums and herbaria are affected by sample biases that strongly compromise our ability to use these data for change detection studies. Here we present a simulation study to find robust methods for rejecting spurious shifts in the geographic range or the environmental niche occupied by species under a variety of sampling biases. We present two methods for addressing bias. The first method is a Bayesian weighting method from machine learning theory in which each specimen is reweighted to achieve uniform sampling intensity in time based on sampling intensity for all specimens. An alternative method uses binomial probabilities of selecting the observed number of samples of a target relative to all specimens and estimates the likelihood associated with the binomial probabilities using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We find that without dealing with sampling bias using raw data is almost certain to provide inaccurate results under even the mildest perturbations to idealized sampling. Among the two methods for addressing bias the empirical estimate of the probability density of a change provided by MCMC was essential for accurately rejecting false changes. The performance of the weighting method while an improvement over the use of raw data was limited to cases in which the bias was weak. We conclude that species distribution changes are most robustly estimated using binomial probabilities in which the probability space is explored empirically by MCMC. 937:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide virtually no attention has been paid to the quantification of error in fragmentation statistics. Landscape pattern indices (LPIs) such as mean patch size and number of patches are routinely used to quantify fragmentation and are often calculated using remote sensing imagery that has been classified into different land cover classes. No classified map is ever completely correct so we asked if different maps with similar misclassification rates could result in widely different errors in pattern indices. We simulated landscapes with varying proportions of habitat and clumpiness (autocorrelation) and then simulated classification errors on the same maps. We simulated higher misclassification at patch edges (as is often observed) and then used a smoothing algorithm routinely used on images to correct salt and pepper classification error. We determined how well classification errors (and smoothing) corresponded to errors seen in four pattern indices. Maps with low misclassification rates often yielded errors in LPIs of much larger magnitude and substantial variability. Although smoothing usually improved classification error it sometimes increased LPI error and reversed the direction of error in LPIs introduced by misclassification. Our results show that classification error is not always a good predictor of errors in LPIs and some types of image postprocessing (for example smoothing) might result in the underestimation of habitat fragmentation. Furthermore our results suggest that there is potential for large errors in nearly every landscape pattern analysis ever published because virtually none quantify the errors in LPIs themselves. 963:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial autocorrelation techniques are commonly used to describe genetic and ecological patterns. To improve statistical inference about spatial covariance we propose a continuous nonparametric estimator of the covariance function in place of the spatial correlogram. The spline correlogram is an adaptation of a recent development in spatial statistics and is a generalization of the commonly used correlogram. We propose a bootstrap algorithm to erect a confidence envelope around the entire covariance function. The meaning of this envelope is discussed. Not all functions that can be drawn inside the envelope are candidate covariance functions as they may not be positive semidefinite. However covariance functions that do not fit are not supported by the data. A direct estimate of the Lo spatial correlation length with associated confidence interval is offered and its interpretation is discussed. The spline correlogram is found to have high precision when applied to synthetic data. For illustration the method is applied to electrophoretic data of an alpine grass (Poa alpina). 973:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Models and to a lesser extent datasets embody sophisticated statements of environmental knowledge. Yet the knowledge they incorporate is rarely self contained enough for them to be understood and used by humans or machines without the modellers mediation. This severely limits the options in reusing environmental models and connecting them to datasets or other models. The notion of   declarative modelling   has been suggested as a remedy to help design communicate share and integrate models. Yet not all these objectives have been achieved by declarative modelling in its current implementations. Semantically aware environmental modelling is a way of designing implementing and deploying environmental datasets and models based on the independent standardized formalization of the underlying environmental science. It can be seen as the result of merging the rationale of declarative modelling with modern knowledge representation theory through the mediation of the integrative vision of a Semantic Web. In this paper we review the present and preview the future of semantic modelling in environmental science: from the mediation approach where formal knowledge is the key to automatic integration of datasets models and analytical pipelines to the knowledge cl riven approach where the knowledge is the key not only to integration but also to overcoming scale and paradigm differences and to novel potentials for model design and automated knowledge discovery. 999:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Genetic methods are routinely used to estimate contemporary effective population size (N(e)) in natural populations but the vast majority of applications have used only the temporal (two sample) method. We use simulated data to evaluate how highly polymorphic molecular markers affect precision and bias in the single sample method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results of this study are as follows: (1) Low frequency alleles upwardly bias (N) over cap (e) but a simple rule can reduce bias to   about 10 PeRcEnT without sacrificing much precision. (2) With datasets routinely available today (10 20 loci with 10 alleles; 50 individuals) precise estimates can be obtained for relatively small populations (N(e)   200) and small populations are not likely to be mistaken for large ones. However it is very difficult to obtain reliable estimates for large populations. (3) With microsatellite data the LD method has greater precision than the temporal method unless the latter is based on samples taken many generations apart. Our results indicate the LD method has widespread applicability to conservation (which typically focuses on small populations) and the study of evolutionary processes in local populations. Considerable opportunity exists to extract more information about N(e) in nature by wider use of single sample estimators and by combining estimates from different methods. 103:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1051:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological reserves are set aside to conserve species in dynamic human dominated landscapes; however most reserve systems protect only small potentially biased samples of environmental conditions across the range of individual species or habitat types. Such biases can result in counter intuitive distributions of environmental conditions under combinations of climate change and habitat loss. This study outlines the potential range of interactions and presents a case study investigating vernal pool wetlands in California USA. The results indicate that future distributions of environmental conditions will be determined as much by land use decisions as by atmospheric emissions. 1055:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecology has emerged as a global science and there is a pressing need to identify ecological rules general principles that will improve its predictive capability for scientists and its usefulness for managers and policy makers. Ideally the generality and limits of these ecological rules should be assessed using extensive coordinated experiments that ensure consistency in design and comparability of data. To improve the design of these large scale efforts existing data should be used to test prospective ecological rules and to identify their limits and contingencies. As an example of this approach we describe prospective rules for grassland responses to fire and rainfall gradients identified from long term studies of North American grasslands and tested with existing data from long term experiments in South African savanna grasslands. Analyses indicated consistent effects of fire on the abundance of the dominant (grasses) and subdominant (forbs) flora on both continents but no common response of grass or forb abundance across a rainfall gradient. Such analyses can inform future research designs to refine and more explicitly test ecological rules. 1067:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Range shifts due to climate change may cause species to move out of protected areas. Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity. 1076:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We conducted an intensive review of conservation science to find out whether the field has tracked priorities over the past 20 years. A total of 628 papers from the literature for the years 1984 1994 and 2004 were surveyed. For each paper we recorded where conservation research was done and what was studied. We found geographic gaps in conservation research with marine tundra and desert biomes being studied less than other systems. We also found taxonomic gaps with amphibians being understudied as compared to other less threatened taxonomic groups. Finally we discovered that studies of invasive species are still lacking despite the magnitude of the threat they pose to global biodiversity. Although there was a weak trend towards filling these gaps between 1984 and 2004 progress has been slow. To be more effective the research community must quickly redirect research to better match conservation priorities. 107:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,108:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,111:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,112:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,114:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A review of 43 habitat conservation plans reveals numerous ways to reduce uncertainty for landowners and imperiled species alike A town meeting in eastern Texas virtually erupts at the mention of a small songbird. The marbled halls of the U.S. Congress echo with angry debate over federal regulation of private property. Two thousand miles away in a rapidly growing area of Tucson Arizona a biologists heart races when she hears an endangered cactus ferruginous pygmy owl reply to calls from her tape recorder. Underlying these seemingly disparate scenes is a common theme that has recently risen to the forefront of both conservation science and national politics: how to effectively manage privately owned habitat for threatened and endangered species. In the past decade habitat conservation plans (HCPs) have emerged as tools of compromise allowing nonfederal landowners to develop their land and thereby damage habitat for imperiled species provided that the impacts are offset through minimization and mitigation measures. These plans have caused considerable controversy largely because of uncertainty about their ultimate impacts on the survival and recovery of imperiled species. A recent exhaustive review of the use of science in HCPs has illustrated the threads of uncertainty in the planning process and the results suggest some general measures that can reduce uncertainty for both landowners and wildlife. 115:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological consciousness has been rising in the United States and Europe over the past 30 years making people more aware of their guardianship of the earths natural resources. In the recent past several projects have been launched to catalogue all living species in an attempt to protect them from extinction. But this sense of protectionism is not applied evenly to all species. Every year populations of plants insects and even microbes reach the brink of extinction virtually unnoticed. In the meantime the threat of large mammal extinctions arouses public passions attention and ultimately money. It is here at the intersection of sentimentality and scientific controversy that conservation biologists typically face their greatest challenge. This challenge is twofold. First biologists need to determine which populations really need recovery action and just as important we need to know when a population no longer requires our intervention. Clearly the efficiency with which these are done can have important economic consequences. Inefficient assessment of conservation activities can lead to economic inequities. It can lead groups to spend money on animal populations that have recovered at the expense of other lesser known and possibly less photogenic species that actually need the help. In short a well defined ecological policy could translate into sound economic policy as well. Yet putting sound conservation policies into place is hardly straightforward. The Endangered Species Conservation Act (ESCA) of 1969 and its 1973 iteration the Endangered Species Act (ESA) defined categories for endangered and threatened species but provided no criteria for deciding when a species should be listed delisted or   downlisted   from endangered to threatened. As a result listing and recovery actions for marine mammals as well as other species are widely inconsistent. The ESA was amended in 1988 to require that recovery plans include specific criteria to determine when a species should be removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. Nevertheless our own work with whales has shown this to be a rather sticky epistemological problem. We are barely at the point that we can determine with any kind of certainty when a population has recovered. Recognizing this we have been working to solve this problem for several populations of endangered whales with the hope that it will move us into a time where rigorous data collection and analysis and not sentimentality drive conservation policy.  117:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1184:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Investigators in the ecological sciences use a wide variety of protocols to collect data on complex topics such as marine bacterial community functions and global carbon flux. The resulting heterogeneous data are stored in autonomous database systems dispersed throughout the research community. There is growing recognition that these data should be networked and preserved for future studies to reuse in replicating and validating scientific conclusions enlarging spatiotemporal scale and so on. Ideally these archived data should be stored in a framework that enables rapid powerful access and discovery. In response to this situation we at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara have developed the modular Metacat framework (short for metadata catalog). The system (available from the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity homepage) incorporates RDF like methods for packaging data sets to allow researchers to customize and revise their metadata. It is extensible and flexible enough to preserve utility and interpretability working with future content standards. Metacat solves several key challenges that impede data confederation efforts in ecological research __ or any field in which independent agencies collect heterogeneous data that they wish to control locally while enabling networked access. This distributed solution integrates with existing site infrastructures because it works with any SQL compliant database system. The frameworks open source based components are widely available and individual sites can extend and customize the system to support their data and metadata needs. 127:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,131:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1324:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, American society derives many benefits from farmland and is often willing to pay to preserve it from urbanization. We present an innovative framework to support farmland preservation programs in prioritizing conservation investments. The framework considers the full range of social benefits of farmland and improves the application of decision analysis methods to the process. Key factors for ranking farms are: 1) social objectives and priorities 2) how much farmland value is expected to be lost to development if not preserved 3) how much farmland value is already secured in the agricultural region and 4) how much it will cost to secure the farms benefits. The framework can be applied strategically over an entire region or to rank a set of applications from landowners. We demonstrate our framework using three criteria in the Bay Area Delta bioregion of California. 1359:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Assessing threats to protected areas is a critical step to ensure effective resource conservation and to leverage future conservation actions. It is equally important to assess external and internal threats because human activities both in and around a protected area can impair the areas ecological goals or impart important ecological benefits to adjacent lands. We applied a threat framework that accounts for both local and surrounding threats to identify areas in the conterminous United States that provide or offer opportunities for ecological conservation. We find that of the lands that are least threatened locally 49 PeRcEnT have some existing formal protection but that more than 35 PeRcEnT of the existing protected portfolio is at risk from external threats. However over 20 PeRcEnT of currently unprotected lands provide potential opportunities for conservation. Of the area identified with highest potential conservation opportunities over 50 PeRcEnT is on private lands highlighting the need to engage owners of private land in conservation. There is greater potential for large buffered core conservation areas in the West but other areas require networks of stepping stone conservation islands. We summarize our results by ecoregions and within 40 national parks identifying areas that are notably unthreatened (Colorado Plateau and Northwestern Glaciated Plains ecoregions and Great Basin and Canyonlands parks) versus those that may require more intense management actions (Eastern Great Lakes and Hudson Lowlands and Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains ecoregions and Cuyahoga Valley and Great Smoky Mountains parks). Finally we discuss how the approach could be applied and improved for finer grained local assessments. . 135:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1360:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Concern over the fate of plant and animal species throughout the world has accelerated over recent decades. Habitat loss is considered the main culprit in reducing many species abundance and range leading to numerous efforts to plan and manage habitat preservation. Our work uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data and modeling to define a spatially explicit analysis of habitat value using the San Joaquin Kit Fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) of California (USA) as an example. Over the last 30 years many field studies and surveys have enhanced our knowledge of the life history behavior and needs of the kit fox which has been proposed as an umbrella or indicator species for grassland habitat in the San Joaquin Valley of California. There has yet been no attempt to convert much of this field knowledge into a model of spatial habitat value useful for planning purposes. This is a significant omission given the importance and visibility of the imperiled kit fox and increasing trends toward spatially explicit modeling and planning. In this paper we apply data from northern California to derive a small cell GIS raster of habitat value for the kit fox that incorporates both intrinsic habitat quality and neighborhood context as well the effects of barriers such as roads. Such a product is a useful basis for assessing the presence and amounts of good (and poor) quality habitat and for eventually constructing GIS representations of viable animal territories that could be included in future reserves. 136:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,137:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,139:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1439:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation measures that were designed to balance the interests of endangered species and land developers are often based on inadequate scientific data according to the most comprehensive review yet of government sanctioned Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs). Improving the science in HCPs would require major government agency initiatives or policy alterations according to the study sponsored by the American Institute of Biological Sciences and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Under the US Endangered Species Act landowners are allowed to kill (or take ) endangered plants and animals or destroy habitat as long as they produce a formal plan to mitigate the loss. The Clinton administration has promoted HCPs as a way of defusing tension between property rights advocates and conservationists. But some scientists have criticized the plans as being too inflexible. The 18 month study involved more than 100 graduate students and 13 faculty advisors at eight universities who reviewed more than 200 HCPs 43 of them in detail. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) the main government agency responsible for protecting endangered species has approved more than 240 HCPs and 200 more are on the way. The reviewers point out that it is too early to evaluate whether the plans are working. Rather they looked at the quality of data used in forming the plans and how well the data were analysed. In general the FWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service which administers a much smaller number of HCPs were found to be doing a good job of analysing the data they have. But in many cases crucial yet basic information on species is unavailable. Although the current status of species on HCP affected lands is generally clear much less is known about the likely effects of takes or the effectiveness of mitigation measures. In only 25 per cent of cases was there a quantitative estimate of take as a result of development and the effect that this would have on the populations viability. The proposed mitigation measures commonly suffered from an absence of data indicating they were likely to succeed. Only about half of the 43 HCPs reviewed in detail included a clearly outlined programme to monitor whether a species declined or recovered after the plan was enacted. The review team led by Peter Kareiva of the University of Washington and Frances James of Florida State University acknowledged that science and the law have different standards. The Endangered Species Act requires only that a plan be based on the best available information and gathering sufficient data may not be practical in all cases. But they say HCPs covering large areas protecting several species or lasting for long periods should be held to higher standards. When critical data are absent an HCP should not be initiated or approved. These high impact plans should go through scientific advisory committees and independent peer review according to the scientists. The study team recommends the creation of a federally funded database containing information about listed species which should be made available to HCP planners as well as the general scientific community. Frankly we think that centralized and readily accessible data on endangered species could do for species protection what centralized and accessible data on criminals and outstanding warrants has done for public safety protection says the team. Surely if we can do this for law enforcement we can also do it for environmental protection. The environmental group Defenders of Wildlife said the report pointed to serious holes in conservation plans. The groups legal director Bill Snape said HCPs must have solid scientific information and assured protections for species. This study confirms our greatest fear that this is not the case. But the FWS takes issue with the study findings in a response posted on its web site: We do not agree with the reports conclusion that the Service lacks adequate scientific data and analysis to support many of the approved HCPs it says. The FWS accuses the study authors of a questionable methodology in using a onesize fits all questionnaire to judge the adequacy of data and claims that reviewers may have overlooked relevant information. They may not have considered that states or tribes would do some of the monitoring. And answers may not have reflected how the FWS gathers information on take. James says the authors reviewed a wide range of documents including biological opinions. Even if some material was missed she says it is unlikely to have changed the reports overall conclusions. Meanwhile the FWS says it will address most of the problems identified in the study in a soon to be revised version of a handbook for HCP planners. It will call for HCPs to establish measurable biological goals and objectives and to be more flexible when there are significant biological data gaps or uncertainty. HCP developers will be asked to develop better monitoring strategies and will be expected to increase public participation in the planning process. 144:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,146:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1481:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Fifth World Parks Congress in Durban South Africa announced in September 2003 that the global network of protected areas now covers 11.5 PeRcEnT of the planets land surface. This surpasses the 10 PeRcEnT target proposed a decade earlier at the Caracas Congress for 9 out of 14 major terrestrial biomes. Such uniform targets based on percentage of area have become deeply embedded into national and international conservation planning. Although politically expedient the scientific basis and conservation value of these targets have been questioned. In practice however little is known of how to set appropriate targets or of the extent to which the current global protected area network fulfils its goal of protecting biodiversity. Here we combine five global data sets on the distribution of species and protected areas to provide the first global gap analysis assessing the effectiveness of protected areas in representing species diversity. We show that the global network is far from complete and demonstrate the inadequacy of uniform that is one size fits all conservation targets. 149:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1638:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,Location models continue to be recognized as valuable tools for providing insights to decision makers regarding the impacts and relative attributes of potential planning alternatives.

There is asubstantial under representation of non vascular species in threatened plant lists reflected in an absence ofdocumented extinctions among fungi and algae. Turnover in the composition of extinct flora lists in Australiasuggests that the lists of threatened species may not be sufficiently reliable to form the basis for reporting on thestate of the environment. They are of limited use in distinguishing between levels of threat and may not be a reliableguide for the allocation of scarce conservation resources among plant species. Systems for listing threatened speciescreate a feedback loop responsive to the subjective preferences of scientists largely unresponsive to underlying truethreats self perpetuating and accentuating bias with each iteration. Other tools including formal decisionapproaches and the acquisition of new kinds of data are needed to fill the roles. 1669:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation priority setting schemes have not yet combined geographic priorities with a framework that can guide the allocation of funds among alternate conservation actions that address specific threats. We develop such a framework and apply it to 17 of the worlds 39 Mediterranean ecoregions. This framework offers an improvement over approaches that only focus on land purchase or species richness and do not account for threats. We discover that one could protect many more plant and vertebrate species by investing in a sequence of conservation actions targeted towards specific threats such as invasive species control land acquisition and off reserve management than by relying solely on acquiring land for protected areas. Applying this new framework will ensure investment in actions that provide the most cost effective outcomes for biodiversity conservation. This will help to minimise the misallocation of scarce conservation resources. 167:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Responding to potential hazards is likely to require precaution related recalibration the extensive integration of complex variables related to inferred risk and fitness.

Most conservation efforts occur at local scales and when effective can increase the resilience of coral reefs to global threats such as climate change  warming water and ocean acidification). Limited resources for conservation require that we efficiently prioritize where and how to best sustain coral reef ecosystems. Here we develop the first prioritization approach that can guide regional scale conservation investments in land and sea based conservation actions that cost effectively mitigate threats to coral reefs and apply it to the Coral Triangle an area of significant global attention and funding. Using information on threats to marine ecosystems effectiveness of management actions at abating threats and the management and opportunity costs of actions we calculate the rate of return on investment in two conservation actions in sixteen ecoregions. We discover that marine conservation almost always trumps terrestrial conservation within any ecoregion but terrestrial conservation in one ecoregion can be a better investment than marine conservation in another. We show how these results could be used to allocate a limited budget for conservation and compare them to priorities based on individual criteria. Previous prioritization approaches do not consider both land and sea based threats or the socioeconomic costs of conserving coral reefs. A simple and transparent approach like ours is essential to support effective coral reef conservation decisions in a large and diverse region like the Coral Triangle but can be applied at any scale and to other marine ecosystems. 1682:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Decision analysis and game theory 1 2 have proved useful tools in various biodiversity conservation planning and modeling contexts 3 5 . This paper shows how game theory may be used to inform group decisions in biodiversity conservation scenarios by modeling conflicts between stakeholders to identify Pareto inefficient Nash equilibria. These are cases in which each agent pursuing individual self interest leads to a worse outcome for all relative to other feasible outcomes. Three case studies from biodiversity conservation contexts showing this feature are modeled to demonstrate how game theoretical representation can inform group decision making. The mathematical theory of games is used to model three biodiversity conservation scenarios with Pareto inefficient Nash equilibria: (i) a two agent case involving wild dogs in South Africa; (ii) a three agent raptor and grouse conservation scenario from the United Kingdom; and (iii) an n agent fish and coral conservation scenario from the Philippines. In each case there is reason to believe that traditional mechanism design solutions that appeal to material incentives may be inadequate and the game theoretical analysis recommends a resumption of further deliberation between agents and the initiation of trust and confidence building measures. Game theory can and should be used as a normative tool in biodiversity conservation contexts: identifying scenarios with Pareto inefficient Nash equilibria enables constructive action in order to achieve (closer to) optimal conservation outcomes whether by policy solutions based on mechanism design or otherwise. However there is mounting evidence 6 that formal mechanism design solutions may backfire in certain cases. Such scenarios demand a return to group deliberation and the creation of reciprocal relationships of trust. 1704:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, People value the existence of a variety of marine species and habitats many of which are negatively impacted by human activities. The Convention on Biological Diversity and other international and national policy agreements have set broad goals for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss. However efforts to conserve biodiversity cannot be effective without comprehensive metrics both to assess progress towards meeting conservation goals and to account for measures that reduce pressures so that positive actions are encouraged. We developed an index based on a global assessment of the condition of marine biodiversity using publically available data to estimate the condition of species and habitats within 151 coastal countries. Our assessment also included data on social and ecological pressures on biodiversity as well as variables that indicate whether good governance is in place to reduce them. Thus our index is a social as well as ecological measure of the current and likely future status of biodiversity. As part of our analyses we set explicit reference points or targets that provide benchmarks for success and allow for comparative assessment of current conditions. Overall country level scores ranged from 43 to 95 on a scale of 1 to 100 but countries that scored high for species did not necessarily score high for habitats. Although most current status scores were relatively high likely future status scores for biodiversity were much lower in most countries due to negative trends for both species and habitats. We also found a strong positive relationship between the Human Development Index and resilience measures that could promote greater sustainability by reducing pressures. This relationship suggests that many developing countries lack effective governance further jeopardizing their ability to maintain species and habitats in the future. 1707:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The characteristics of referees and the potential subsequent effects on the peer review process are an important consideration for science since the integrity of the system depends on the appropriate evaluation of merit. In 2006 we conducted an online survey of 1334 ecologists and evolutionary biologists pertaining to the review process. Respondents were from Europe North America and other regions of the world with the majority from English first language countries. Women comprised a third of all respondents consistent with their representation in the scientific academic community. Among respondents we found no correlation between the time typically taken over a review and the reported average rejection rate. On average Europeans took longer over reviewing a manuscript than North Americans and females took longer than males but reviewed fewer manuscripts. Males recommended rejection of manuscripts more frequently than females regardless of region. Hence editors and potential authors should consider alternative sets of criteria to what exists now when selecting a panel of referees to potentially balance different tendencies by gender or region. 170:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,173:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1762:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species diversity is unevenly distributed across the globe with terrestrial diversity concentrated in a few restricted biodiversity hotspots. These areas are associated with high losses of primary vegetation and increased human population density resulting in growing numbers of threatened species. We show that conservation of these hotspots is critical because they harbor even greater amounts of evolutionary history than expected by species numbers alone. We used supertrees for carnivores and primates to estimate that nearly 70 PeRcEnT of the total amount of evolutionary history represented in these groups is found in 25 biodiversity hotspots. 176:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this paper we present the results of a multi criteria decision analysis used to identify a comprehensive set of criteria for assigning biodiversity value to sites for conservation planning. For effective conservation management biodiversity value needs to be a composite of biotic and abiotic factors. However in the reserve design literature conservation value is assigned with a limited set of metrics usually based on comprehensiveness representativeness and persistence which may be insufficient at fully capturing biodiversity value. A group of conservation specialists in California USA used a multi criteria decision making framework to elucidate and weight criteria for scoring biodiversity value at sites. A formal model for consensus and negotiation was applied to aggregate individuals criteria weights across all group members. The group identified ecological condition followed by biotic composition as the most important contributors to site conservation value. Long and short term threats causing fragmentation and degradation are also important criteria to consider. Key criteria are identified for which further data collection would serve the greatest purpose in prioritizing sites and the role of prioritization criteria in the larger context of systematic conservation planning is discussed. With the recognition that biodiversity value plays an important role in conservation decisions the criteria presented here represents a comprehensive suite of factors to consider when assigning biodiversity value to sites for conservation planning. These can serve as an encompassing list which other groups can customize for the purpose of biodiversity evaluation for alternative conservation planning contexts. 1775:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The use of umbrella and flagship species as surrogates for regional biota whose spatial distributions are poorly known is a popular conservation strategy. Yet many assumptions underlying the choice of surrogate species remain untested. By using biodiversity databases containing spatial incidence data for species of concern for (i) the southern California coastal sage scrub habitat (ii) the Columbia Plateau ecoregion and (iii) the continental United States we evaluate the potential effectiveness of a range of conservation surrogate schemes  big carnivores charismatic species keystone species wide ranging species) asking how many species potentially are protected by each scheme and at what cost in each habitat area. For all three databases we find that none of the surrogate schemes we evaluated performs significantly better than do a comparable number of species randomly selected from the database. Although some surrogate species may have considerable publicity value based on the databases we analyzed representing diverse taxa on three different geographic scales we find that the utility of umbrella and flagship species as surrogates for regional biodiversity may be limited. 177:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1787:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With intensifying demands for food and biofuels a critical threat to biodiversity is agricultural expansion into native tropical ecosystems. Tropical agriculture particularly intensive agriculture often supports few native organisms and consequently has been largely overlooked in conservation planning; yet recent work in the Neotropics demonstrates that tropical agriculture with certain features can support significant biodiversity decades after conversion to farmland. It remains unknown whether this conservation value can be sustained for centuries to millennia. Here we quantify the bird diversity affiliated with agricultural systems in southwest India a region continuously cultivated for  2 000 years. We show that arecanut palm (Areca catechu) production systems retain 90 PeRcEnT of the bird species associated with regional native forest. Two factors promote this high conservation value. First the system involves intercropping with multiple usually woody understory species and thus has high vertical structural complexity that is positively correlated with bird species richness. Second the system encompasses nearby forests where large quantities of leaf litter are extracted for mulch. The preservation of these forests on productive land traces back to their value in supplying inputs to arecanut cultivation. The long term biodiversity value of an agricultural ecosystem has not been documented in South and Southeast Asia. Our findings open a new conservation opportunity for this imperiled region that may well extend to other crops. Some of these working lands may be able to sustain native species over long time scales indicating that conservation investments in agriculture today could pay off for people and for nature. 178:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,179:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The goal of biodiversity hotspots is to identify regions around the world where conservation priorities should be focused. We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a 300 m pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than 10 PeRcEnT forest cover in protected areas. San F lix San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests Maldives Lakshadweep Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than 500 km(2) forest cover is less than 50 km(2) and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions. This should improve our ability to compare prioritize and monitor forests in biodiversity hotspots. 181:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1861:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An index of deforestation pressure is suggested as useful for reserve planning alongside the currently used information on the species present at candidate sites. For any location the index value is correlated with threats to habitat and thus also survival probabilities over time for members of species dependent on that habitat. Threats in the absence of reserves are key information for planning new reserves. The index is estimated using a regression approach derived from a dynamic micro econornic model of land use with data on observed clearing of forest over space and time as well as biophysical and socioeconomic factors in land returns. Applying an estimated threat (or probability of clearing) function for Costa Rica to locations of interest yields relevant estimates of sites deforestation pressure which are used to evaluate proposed reserves and to suggest other candidate sites. 1862:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biodiversity is a valuable but poorly understood natural resource which is being lost at an accelerating rate as a result of human actions. We present a broad introductory review of biodiversity concepts. Biodiversity is first defined at the species and community levels. Available methods and approaches for quantifying biodiversity are discussed with specific reference to the spatial scales over which these measures can be applied. Dominant threats to biodiversity are reviewed. Fundamental patterns and processes that underlie ecological production functions are outlined. Differing rationales for biodiversity conservation are given and compared. Finally the Current suite of approaches employed in biodiversity conservation is discussed. Our aim in writing this review is to encourage further much needed inter disciplinary collaboration among economists and ecologists on biodiversity questions. 1867:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We analyze the problem of choosing sites through time to include in a network of biological reserves for species conservation. When sites cannot all be protected immediately and excluded sites are threatened by development planning should factor in both expected biodiversity benefits of sites and development risk. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic integer programming problem. We find that the timing of selections is critical; conservation budgets available up front yield significantly greater biodiversity protection. We also compare results using optimal and heuristic algorithms. The theory is applied to vertebrate and development threat data from southwestern California. 1872:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Across the Pacific Northwest (PNW) both public and private agents are working to improve riverine habitat for a variety of reasons including improving conditions for threatened and endangered salmon. These projects are moving forward with little or no knowledge of specific linkages between restoration actions and the responses of target species. Targeted effectiveness monitoring of these actions is required to redress this lack of mechanistic understanding but such monitoring depends on detailed restoration information that is implementation monitoring. This article describes the process of assembling a database of restoration projects intended to improve stream and river habitat throughout the PNW. We designed the database specifically to address the needs of regional monitoring programs that evaluate the effectiveness of restoration actions. The database currently contains spatially referenced project level data on over 23 000 restoration actions initiated ai over 35 000 locations in the last 15 years (98 PeRcEnT of projects report start or end dates between 1991 and 2005) in the states of Washington Oregon Idaho and Montana. Data sources included federal state local nongovernmental organization and tribal contributors. The process of database production identified difficulties in the design of regional project tracking systems. The technical design issues range from low level information such as what defines a project or a location to high level issues that include data validation and legalities of interagency data sharing. The completed database will inform efficient monitoring design effectiveness assessments and restoration project planning. 1898:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Environmental change and anthrepogenic activities threaten biodiversity and compromise essential ecosystem services at local to global scales. Despite this current ecological understanding derives mainly from site specific research and measurements at scales of 10 m2 and at durations of 5 years. Several new Conservation Internationals TEAM the National Park Service Vital Signs and SAEON (South African Environmental Observatory Network) or proposed the U.S. National Science Foundations NEON and ORION) initiatives for continental and global scale research and monitoring networks represent unprecedented new funding in support of ecological research. These programs promise to expand scales of ecological understanding and transform ecology into a more mechanistic and predictive science. Some assume that such networks should be assembled by locating a single site in each of a number of ecoregions biomes or biodiversity hotspots or that by developing large networks employing standard methods many questions will be answered by brute force. However the high degree of variability inherent in large scale systems makes it difficult to disentangle exogenous and endogenous sources of change and may compromise the efficacy of network designs. Designing an effective largescale ecological network is remarkably complex. In particular ensuring appropriate levels of integrated sampling to achieve adequate statistical power at multiple spatial and temporal scales is extremely demanding. Previous efforts often involving substantial expense have been limited by several recurring problems: absence of clear questions underlying the design sampling inadequacy and bias inadequate statistical power heterogeneity of measurement incomplete and unstructured metadata lack of tools for integration and analysis of heterogeneous data and cultural or institutional impediments to data sharing. By tradition ecology has been a grassroots discipline in which individual investigators drive the scientific enterprise in an uncoordinated and serendipitous fashion. Transforming this paradigm to one that will advance large scale mechanistic understanding across multiple spatial and temporal scales that reflect critical environmental gradients will require a revolutionary change in approach and in the culture of the discipline.  1915:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, For 2 months earlier this fall University of Washington Seattle grad student Amanda Stanley sifted through reams of documents from dense scientific articles to denser federal reports bearing on the fate of northern spotted owls marbled murrelets and other imperiled icons of the Pacific Northwest. Her task was to assess the quality of the science underpinning the state of Washingtons 1996 plan to protect these species while allowing some logging on the states land. Sound like a nightmarish grad school assignment?   I had no idea what I was getting into    Stanley admits. The slogging was no mere academic exercise: Stanley was one of 106 grad students from eight universities who played a role in one of the most unusual ecological studies ever undertaken. Led by Peter Kareiva of the University of Washington and 12 other ecologists the students last week completed an initial assessment of the science behind a divisive environmental policy tool: habitat conservation plans (HCPs) agreements that allow developers to harm endangered species in return for specified efforts to protect habitat. A growing chorus of environmentalists and scientists has argued that many HCPs usually drafted by scientific consultants hired by landowners are flawed and effectively promote extinction (Science 13 June p. 1636). But at a meeting here last week at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) Kareivas group offered a different view: HCPs are far from the junk science giveaways to developers depicted by their harshest critics. Although the group also reported that the plans are frequently plagued by inadequate monitoring and a lack of key data the analysis puts HCPs in a better light.   What did surprise me    says meeting attendee Ron Pulliam of the University of Georgia in Athens   was how well the science was used when it was available.   194:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,2023:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Possingham . have warned against the improper use of threatened species lists. However their characterization of misuse masks the essential role of these lists in conservation. Although threatened species lists are indeed typically problematic the IUCN Red List provides quantitative measures rather than qualitative estimates of extinction risk and as such is a major exception. We agree with Possingham .s main point that (i)t is na __ve and counterproductive from all points of view for recovery to guide reserve planning or to constrain the use of the natural environment . However most recovery and planning efforts already avoid this danger by using a diverse array of information. The strongest evidence that they present of sole reliance on threatened species lists is the link between such lists and the allocation of funds for species recovery. Even where this is true it does not support rejecting the use of threatened species lists to inform prioritization. However that is what Possingham . appear to endorse when they declare (i)t is inappropriate to use threatened species lists for resource allocation . Contradictorily the second half of the same paragraph states (s)tatus is only part of the information required for resource allocation . We can only assume that the authors realize the value of threatened species lists for prioritizing species recovery but object to the allocation of resources to the most threatened species. However in their attempt to highlight a particular misuse of threatened species lists they manage to discredit the use of such lists in general. Possingham . draw attention to several genuine problems that can undermine the credibility of threatened species lists and invite misuse which have also been raised by other authors: that is qualitative estimate of risk political influence uneven taxonomic or geographical coverage. That changes in the lists reflect changes in knowledge more often than do changes in status has also been discussed. Over the past 15 years the IUCN Red List has concentrated on overcoming these problems. IUCN The World Conservation Union has been producing Red Data Books and Red Lists since 1963. The current list updated annually is a product of the Species Survival Commission (SSC) a network of .7000 scientists who provide assessments with independent peer review. Transparency and accountability are the cornerstones; species assessors are named and data sources referenced. The listing protocol is clear and comprehensive but flexible enough to handle uncertainty and also incorporates detailed quantitative data. Listings can be challenged and the SSC seeks to facilitate the resolution of disagreements. The IUCN Red List is global and strives for taxonomic completeness. BirdLife International (then ICBP) produced the first worldwide list of threatened birds in 1988 and has revised it twice. All mammals have been assessed since 1996 and a comprehensive update is ongoing. An assessment of all amphibians including range maps is due in 2003. The IUCN Red List database also records whether a species has been assessed for the first time and logs the reasons for any change in status. This information heightens the awareness of species groups for which real extinction risk has increased  albatrosses and freshwater turtles of South East Asia). The IUCN Red List is one of the most effective sources of information for conservation planners. Possingham . acknowledge the value of sound threatened species lists when they describe them as a tool that should be a part of the contributing information but this point deserves greater prominence. The IUCN Red List is unique in its efforts to be both quantitative and comprehensive to reduce the potential for misuse. Therefore as the IUCN Red List continues to advance it will remain an essential data set for informing conservation planning in all the ways outlined by Possingham . 2032:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation biology research exhibits a striking but unhelpful dichotomy. Analyses of species decline extinction risk and threat mitigation typically encompass broad taxonomic and spatial scales. By contrast most studies of recovery lack generality pertaining to specific species populations or locales. Narrowly focused analyses offer a weak empirical basis for identifying generic recovery correlates across species particularly in cases where recovery is not effected by an abatement of threats. We present a research framework for multi species meta analyses to identify early warning signals red flags of impaired recovery that can be used as predictors of recovery potential before recovery efforts are initiated. An empirically comprehensive understanding of the demographic ecological evolutionary and threat related factors affecting the rate and trajectory of species recovery will strengthen conservation efforts to set recovery priorities targets and timelines. 203:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological reserves are established to protect natural resources and represent the diversity of environments found within a region. Unfortunately many systems of protected areas do not proportionally capture the range of environmental conditions occupied by species and communities. Combinations of habitat loss and climate change may exacerbate these representational biases and result in future distributions of environmental conditions that bare little resemblance to historic patterns. New protected areas need to tie established to correct existing biases and create conservation networks that remain representative despite climate change. habitat loss and changes in species distributions. We demonstrate a new method to identify and prioritize habitat based on its value for improving bioclimatic representation. We assessed representation provided by existing protected areas for 301 Proteaceae specius under historic and projected 2050 climate across the Cape Floristic Region in South Africa. The existing reserve system has relatively modest biases with respect to current species distributions and climate. However if the system is not supplemented protected areas in 2050 will capture an increasingly skewed sample of climatic conditions occupied by Proteaceae. These biases can be repaired through the systematic establishment of new protected areas and many of the most valuable areas coincide with high priority ecosystem components and irreplaceable elements identified in the Cape Action for People and the Environmental conservation plan. Protecting these areas achieves nearly the best possible improvement in climatic representation while also meeting biodiversity representation goals. 2048:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many conservation biologists believe the best ethical basis for conserving natural entities is their claimed intrinsic value not their instrumental value for humans. But there is significant confusion about what intrinsic value is and flow it could govern conservation decision making. After examining what intrinsic value is supposed to be we argue that it cannot guide the decision making conservation requires. An adequate ethical basis for conservation must do this and instrumental value does it best. 204:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological reserves are intended to protect species communities and ecosystems in human dominated landscapes. However existing protected areas represent only relatively small geographically biased samples of species and habitats. Climate change and habitat loss can exacerbate these biases and the net result is a small skewed subset of historic environmental conditions. We developed a general model to improve the representation of environmental conditions across the range of at risk species or any other elements targeted for conservation. We implemented the model as an integer linear programming problem to select additional areas to complement existing reserves and create new portfolios that are bioclimatically representative across a range of climatic scenarios. We demonstrated the use of the model for a small dataset including two hydrologic variables across the range of five species of fairy shrimp (Anostraca) in the Central Valley ecoregion of California USA under three climate scenarios. The bioclimatic representation model identified solutions that meet biodiversity representation goals and substantially improve bioclimatic representation at minimal additional cost in terms of total land selected for a conservation portfolio. Additional constraints rewarding bioclimatic representation under two conflicting climate scenarios resulted in only a small decrease in the performance of solutions with respect to current climate. We conclude that this model provides a general tool for improving bioclimatic representation and results from the Central Valley case study suggest an encouraging testable hypothesis that climatically robust bioclimatic representation can be achieved at negligible marginal costs. 205:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation problems typically involve groups with competing objectives and strategies. Taking effective conservation action requires identifying dependencies between competing strategies and determining which action optimally achieves the appropriate conservation goals given those dependencies. We show how several real world conservation problems can be modeled game theoretically. Three types of problems drive our analysis: multi national conservation cooperation management of common pool resources and games against nature. By revealing the underlying structure of these and other problems game theoretic models suggest potential solutions that are often invisible to the usual management protocol: decision followed by monitoring feedback and revised decisions. The kind of adaptive management provided by the game theoretic approach therefore complements existing adaptive management methodologies. 2065:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the most comprehensive resource detailing the global conservation status of plants and animals. The 2004 edition represents a milestone in the four decade long history of the Red List including the first Global Amphibian Assessment and a near doubling in assessed species since 2000. Moreover the Red List assessment process itself has developed substantially over the past decade extending the value of the Red List far beyond the assignation of threat status. We highlight here how the Red List in conjunction with the comprehensive data compiled to support it and in spite of several important limitations has become an increasingly powerful tool for conservation planning management monitoring and decision making. 2068:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Threatened species lists are designed primarily to provide an easily understood qualitative estimate of risk of extinction. Although these estimates of risk can be accurate the lists have inevitably become linked to several decision making processes. There are four ways in which such lists are commonly used: to set priorities for resource allocation for species recovery; to inform reserve system design; to constrain development and exploitation; and to report on the state of the environment. The lists were not designed for any one of these purposes and consequently perform some of them poorly. We discuss why if and how they should be used to achieve these purposes. 2074:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Scientific workflow systems are problem solving environments that allow scientists to automate and reproduce data management and analysis tasks. Workflow components include actors  queries transformations analyses simulations visualizations) and datasets which are produced and consumed by actors. The increasing number of such components creates the problem of discovering suitable components and of composing them to form the desired scientific workflow. In previous work we proposed the use of semantic types (annotations relative to an ontology) to solve these problems. Since creating semantic types can be complex and time consuming scalability of the approach becomes an issue. In this paper we propose a framework to automatically derive semantic types from a (possibly small) number of initial types. Our approach propagates the given semantic types through workflow steps whose input and output data structures are related via query expressions. By propagating semantic types we can significantly reduce the effort required to annotate datasets and components and even derive new   candidate axioms   for inclusion in annotation ontologies. 207:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Efficient planning for biodiversity conservation requires a consideration of complementarity when assessing the value of adding new areas for management. Unfortunately complementarity in biodiversity across all groups cannot usually be measured directly so methods are needed to choose good surrogates (or indicators) for predicting this overall complementarity. Previous attempts at assessment of biological surrogates have measured dissimilarity among biotas or congruence between sets of selected areas or species representation within a set of selected areas all of which can seriously misrepresent the strength of a surrogate relationship across all areas. Therefore we propose a new approach to complementarity analysis. We show that the pattern of complementarity among all biotas can be assessed in terms of the frequency of false high and false low predictions by the surrogates. We also show how the spatial pattern in these false predictions can be mapped and discuss their usefulness. On the one hand areas on these maps associated with many false high predictions are overvalued and would be an inefficient investment for scarce conservation resources. On the other hand areas associated with many false low predictions are under valued and unlikely to attract conservation action so we need to know whether they are particularly likely to be highly threatened. These geographical patterns can be used to identify habitat associated biases in the performance of surrogate groups. 208:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Expanding habitat protection is a common strategy for species conservation. We present a model to optimize the expansion of reserves for disjunct populations of all endangered species. The objective is to maximize the expected number of surviving populations subject to budget and habitat constraints. The model accounts for benefits of reserve expansion in teens of likelihood of persistence of each population and monetary cost. Solving the model with incrementally higher budgets helps prioritize sites for expansion and produces a cost curve showing funds required for incremental increases in the objective. We applied the model to the problem of allocating funds among eight reserves for the endangered San Joaquin kit fox ( Vulpes macrotis mutica) in California USA. The priorities for reserve expansion were related to land cost and amount of already protected habitat at each site. Western Kern and Ciervo Panoche sites received highest priority because land costs were low and moderate amounts of already protected habitat resulted in large reductions in extinction risk for small increments of habitat protection. The sensitivity analysis focused oil the impacts of kit fox reproductive success and home range ill non native grassland sites. If grassland habitat is lower quality than brushland habitat resulting in higher annual variation in reproductive success or larger home ranges then protecting habitat at the best grassland site (Ciervo Panoche) is not cost efficient relative to shrubland sites (Western Kern Antelope Plain Carrizo Plain). Finally results suggested that lowest priority should be given to three relatively high cost grassland sites (Camp Roberts Contra Costa and Western Madera) because protecting habitat at those sites would be expensive and have little effect oil the expected number of surviving kit fox populations. 211:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Global conservation needs far exceed the available resources so scarce resources must be used cost effectively. Although many conservation priory setting frameworks used by NGOs or public agencies explicitly claim to emphasize efficiency or wise investment none actually incorporates costs in a formal return on investment (ROI) framework. We illustrate here how an ROI framework can be applied to real world resource allocation decisions faced by conservation organizations. We present two examples: (1) allocating resources to purchase land in 21 ecoregions that make up the Temperate Forest Habitat in the US; (2) allocating resources among a variety of conservation actions (not just land purchase) in Mediterranean habitats with rates of habitat loss factored into the analysis. An important feature of both case studies is that costs vary by orders of magnitude depending on where or how one is doing conservation. Second because costs and biodiversity are not well correlated enormous savings are possible by applying an ROI analysis. Moreover recommended priorities after including costs in the calculations often deviate substantially from priorities based solely on biodiversity measures. Hence we argue that a major effort of conservationist biologists should be to include and record the costs of conservation actions. If serious attention is not given to returns on investment it implies that   money is no object.   216:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Lists of extinct Australian plants created over the last 20 years were examined and were shown to have high levels of turnover. In general the lists are contracting in length and their composition changes substantially a phenomenon we term the Lazarus effect. There is little explanation for these changes ill the cryptic nature of species habits or their distribution ill remote locations. Most of the turnover is due to changes ill knowledge about the species status. and changes in taxonomy. Lists maintained in some other countries are more stable but at the potential cost of underestimating the extent of extinction. Comparisons between jurisdictions and between lists are difficult because of different attitudes taken towards uncertainty and variation in research effort among different taxa. For any assessment that uses lists of extinct or threatened species as indicators of environmental change we recommend that sources of bias M e reduced and that uncertainties ill lists are made snore transparent. An important step in this process is to distinguish listing changes due to a change in status from those due to a change ill knowledge about distribution abundance and taxonomy. Assessments of environmental change based oil species lists should be standardised to exclude these latter sources of variation. and take into account new assessments of previously unevaluated taxa. 219:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,219:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The primary goals of marine reserves include protecting biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Therefore a multispecies approach to designing and monitoring reserve networks is necessary. To gain insight into how the interactions between species in marine communities may affect reserve design we synthesize marine reserve community models and community models with habitat destruction and fragmentation and we develop new extensions of existing models. This synthesis highlights the potential for species interactions to alter reserve design criteria; in particular accounting for species interactions often leads to an increase in reserve size necessary to protect populations. Accounting for species interactions also indicates the need to base reserve design and monitoring on a variety of species especially long distance dispersers inferior colonizers and specialists. Finally the new model extensions highlight how given dispersal source populations outside reserves as well as increases in fished populations after reserve establishment may negatively affect reserve populations of competitors or prey. Therefore multispecies harvest dynamics outside reserves and before reserve establishment are critical to determining the appropriate reserve size spacing and expectations after establishment. These models highlight the importance of species interactions to reserve design and provide guidelines for how this complexity can begin to be incorporated into conservation planning. 220:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The transformation and degradation of tropical forest is thought to be the primary driving force in the loss of biodiversity worldwide. Developing countries are trying to counter act this massive lost of biodiversity by implementing national parks and biological reserves. Costa Rica is no exception to this rule. National development strategies in Costa Rica since the early 1970s have involved the creation of several National Parks and Biological Reserves. This has led to monitoring the integrity of and interactions between these protected areas. Key questions include:   Are these areas boundaries respected?  ;   Do they create a functioning network?  ; and   Are they effective conservation tools?  . This paper quantifies deforestation and secondary growth trends within and around protected areas between 1960 and 1997. We find that inside of national parks and biological reserves deforestation rates were negligible. For areas outside of National Parks and Biological reserves we report that for 1 km buffer zones around such protected areas. there is a net forest gain for the 1987 1997 time period. Thus it appears that to this point the boundaries of protected areas are respected.

Department of Applied Mathematics University of Adelaide Adelaide SA 5005; Australia.) and a model that incorporates both sampling and process error in estimating population parameters from timeseries data (Gerber and DeMaster 1999; Gerber L.R. DeMaster D.P 1999. An approach to endangered species act classification of long lived vertebrates: a case study of north Pacific humpback whales. Conservation Biology 13 (5);1203 1214.). Results are compared with a third model that encompasses three different geographic scales (York . 1996; York A.E. Merrick R.L. Loughlin T.R. 1996. An analysis of the Steller Sea lion metapopulation in Alaska. In: McCullough D.R. (Ed.) Metapopulations and Wildlife Conservation. Island Press Covelo CA pp. 259 292). The combination of modeling approaches provides a basis for considering how model parameterization and the selection of classification criteria affect both model results and potential status determinations. Results from the models generally agree with regard to central tendency 25th and 75th percentile times to extinction. For Steller sea lions the distributions of time to extinction for each model were narrower than the range of extinction distributions between models. If this finding applies generally to listed species it would suggest that more than one viability model should be considered when listing decisions are made. On a more applied basis the results of our analysis provide a quantitative assessment of extinction risk of Steller sea lions in the context of its status pursuant to the US Endangered Species Act. 223:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,237:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,239:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,241:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,242:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,243:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, When President Clinton appointed Bruce Babbitt as Secretary of the Interior in January 1993 the country had been wrestling with the spotted owl issue for several years. A US Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) environmental impact statement had been challenged by conservation groups who then petitioned the US Department of Interior (DOI) Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to place the spotted owl on the endangered species list. The ensuing FWS decision not to list the spotted owl had gone to the courts and been judged to be arbitrary capricious and lacking in scientific justification. Subsequent negotiations over timber cutting in the national forests and a recovery plan for the spotted owl included heavy involvement by President Clinton; continuing confrontation between conservation groups the timber industry and the Pacific Northwest congressional delegations; and death threats to agency employees caught in the middle. Secretary Babbitt saw all of these events as a __train wreck.__ He reasoned that if incipient threatened and endangered species could be identified and their habitats saved or improved to stem further decline such disputes could be avoided and new train wrecks headed off. Such an effort would require a concerted survey of US biota to identify incipient threatened and endangered species and an agency in DOI to conduct the survey. The secretary was also aware of charges that the objectivity of agency research is often biased or used selectively to support agency policy positions. A separate research agency in DOI could distance investigators from policy pressures of DOI management agencies and free objective research on contentious issues. It was on the basis of these rationales that a new research agency the National Biological Survey (NBS) was formed in 1993 within DOI. Its subsequent history is a stark object lesson in how constructive intentions can have a cost__indeed how they can be sent on a tortuous path by unanticipated political tides and insufficient attention to organizational sensitivities. Indeed DOI came to the brink of losing all of its biological research. 246:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservationists from Muir to McCauley have championed intrinsic value as the right basis for conservation one that derives from qualities innate to nonhuman biota independent of human affairs. They argue that intrinsic value acknowledges the integrity of all species and eco systems protects them from short term human whims and gives conservation the ethical status it deserves. Many of the same authors deride instrumental value as a basis for conservation claiming that valuing nonhuman biota in relation to human interests and preferences cheapens the biotas innate worth and makes them vulnerable to competing demands from human population growth and land use change. In contrast they describe intrinsic value as priceless even infinite trumping other assertions of value and thus providing the strongest foundation for conservation. We think this view is mistaken for two reasons: (1) intrinsic value is a vaguely formulated concept and not amenable to the sort of comparative expression needed for conservation decision making and (2) instrumental value is a much richer concept than generally appreciated permitting a full range of values of biota to be considered in conservation decisions. Whats wrong with intrinsic value? The idea that species and ecosystems have intrinsic value inspires many conservationists perhaps drawing on deep seated emotional connections to the non human environment. However although intrinsic value may get conservationists out of bed in the morning and into the field or up to the bargaining table it does not serve them well once they get there. Conservation requires decision making and here intrinsic value falls short. Decision making requires tradeoffs: competition among conservation projects for limited funds and personnel compromises between preservation of biota and other human uses and even conflicts between conservation goals  predation by endangered peregrine falcons threatening recovery of also endangered California least terns). Trade offs require comparative evaluation of competing claims whether this evaluation is done explicitly  by eliciting preferences as in multicriteria decision analysis or by monetizing value as in contingent valuation) or implicitly by taking a particular decision  approving a development proposal for a land parcel that harbors a threatened ecosystem such as longleaf pine savannah). Proponents of intrinsic value as a basis for conservation action hope that it will take precedence over competing claims and guarantee conservation. This rarely happens even for decisions relatively insulated from the pressures of competing demands. For example any species that is threatened or endangered is eligible for protection under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA). In principle intrinsic value should give any kind of species equal access to ESA listing. In practice however limited funds and personnel to administer the ESA and political and legal pressures to list particular species (or not) have forced agencies responsible for listing decisions to assign priorities to species on the basis of scientific characteristics such as taxonomic distinctiveness and geographic distribution and visceral characteristics such as large size and charismatic appeal. Intrinsic value may get a proposed listing to the table but it does not muster the attention needed to get it off the table and into action. When protection of species and eco systems conflicts with economic development or with immediate human needs intrinsic value is even less likely to be an effective basis for conservation. Although proponents of intrinsic value hope that it will take priority over competing socio economic demands it is more likely that conservation goals will be cast aside in favor of those more easily computed in familiar metrics such as dollars. This is not unique to conservation decisionmaking. Many assert that human life has intrinsic value and object to evaluating the preservation or extension of a life in relation to profit convenience or other desired ends. Yet decisions about health and safety regulations such as setting highway speed limits or permissable levels of pesticide residues in food require at least implicit calculation of what human life is worth. Sometimes that calculation is made explicitly and extension of life or prevention of illness is expressed in quantitative perhaps monetary terms. Whats right about instrumental value? Characteristics such as those used to assign priorities among species proposed for ESA listing show that some people attribute greater conservation value to some species than to others. These characteristics depend upon instrumental values which express values species have in relation to other desired ends  preservation of genetic diversity or evolutionary processes or aesthetically desirable ecosystems) rather than in terms of the value intrinsic to the species itself. This is a comparative concept of value rather than the incommensurate priceless or perhaps infinite value that some claim for intrinsic value; this comparative value is exactly what conservation decision making requires. Proponents of intrinsic value have objected to the use of instrumental value as a basis for conservation on several grounds. One is that valuing nonhuman biota in relation to some further end is morally objectionable. In this view species and ecosystems are regarded as having sacred value in the sense used by Hanselmann and Tanner who characterized trade offs involving sacred values as taboo distressing those facing such choices. But such trade offs must be made and methods of measuring conservation values against competing demands are therefore required. Some objections to instrumental value as a basis for conservation stem from too narrow a view of instrumental value in particular one that puts too much emphasis on market based and monetary expressions of instrumental value. For example McCauley criticized the use of ecosystem services markets to motivate conservation as selling out on nature arguing that only rarely will conservation of biota provide the services that humans need more cheaply than engineered solutions. But this neglects other types of instrumental value that might contribute to the value of species and ecosystems: aesthetic spiritual educational scientific and even existence value__satisfaction humans derive from knowing that species and ecosystems remain even if they are not experienced directly. This broader view of instrumental value captures much that proponents ascribe to intrinsic value but in a form that can be evaluated comparatively and used in conservation decision making. There are qualitative and quantitative methods for eliciting different kinds of instrumental value for use in formal and informal decision frameworks. Some such as contingent valuation through willingness to pay or willingness to accept survey protocols express various kinds of instrumental value and trade offs between costs and benefits in monetary terms. Others such as utility or preference elicitation protocols from decision analysis express value in terms of relative preference of decision makers or stakeholders among possible levels for particular instrumental values such as aesthetic value. These methods articulate tradeoffs among competing goals by showing how much of one instrumental value  aesthetics) a stakeholder or decision maker would be willing to exchange for another  an ecosystem service such as clean water). These protocols represent relative value in numerical but nonmonetary terms. Monetary expressions of instrumental value can be used in cost benefit analyses and both monetary and nonmonetary expressions can be used in cost effectiveness analyses and in multi criteria decision frameworks such as multi attribute utility analysis the analytic hierarchy process or outranking procedures. Cost benefit analyses and multi criteria decision frameworks can aid stakeholder negotiations convened to adjudicate controversies about conservation actions. Undoubtedly arguing that instrumental value is more useful for conservation decisions than intrinsic value will not satisfy everyone. The essential tension between the emotional appeal of intrinsic value and the trade offs required by conservation decisions is probably irreconcilable. Using instrumental value to bring aesthetic spiritual and cultural values of biota into conservation decision making will not satisfy deep ecologists and others who find weighing one form of value against another abhorrent. But those defending conservation against competing uses and allocating scarce resources among conservation actions are better served by building their decisions on a strong foundation of instrumental value rather than on the weak concept of intrinsic value. 256:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Science should be able to guide management actions intended to help species that are at risk of extinction. One of the best ways to ask whether science is doing this job in conservation is to examine the implementation of the US Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESAs ultimate goal is to recover listed species. As part of the recovery process the ESA requires the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to develop recovery plans for all listed species unless the agency determines that a recovery plan will not promote the conservation of a particular species. Recovery plans are the central documents available to decisionmakers and serve as guides for the management and recovery of threatened and endangered species. Because these plans play a critical role in endangered species management we undertook a systematic and quantitative analysis of recovery plans to evaluate the extent to which scientific principles and analyses were used when designing strategies for species recovery and whether the presence of solid science was measurably correlated with indicators of plan effectiveness. Here we present analyses that test four major hypotheses concerning factors we expected a priori to influence the effectiveness of recovery plans as measured by trends in species status  improving stable or declining): 1. Revised plans would be more effective than plans that had never been revised. Recovery plans developed by a diverse group of authors would be more effective than those written only by federal employees. Plans in which recovery criteria (or goals) were explicitly linked to a species biology would be more effective than those without such links to biology. Multispecies plans would be more effective than singlespecies plans because multispecies plans must adopt a broad view of threats and be more integrative. Hypotheses 1 2 and 4 were motivated largely by USFWS policy initiatives based on the veracity of those propositions. The USFWS and NMFS issued joint policies addressing the diversification of expertise and background of participants in plan development and the development of ecosystem plans where multiple listed species or species that are candidates for listing co occur. In addition official USFWS Recovery Planning Training courses stress that recovery plans should be revised whenever there is significant new information or changes in a species status. Hypothesis 3 represents what we considered the most central query regarding the value of science in recovery planning. Our approach like that of traditional studies of plant or animal populations was to collect attribute data on a sample of individuals drawn from the population of approved recovery plans.We gleaned generalizations by examining the aggregated data for patterns of covariation among plan attributes or by asking whether there were marked differences among subgroups of the population. Statistical analyses were used to determine whether observed patterns in the data were significant  unlikely to be attributable to sampling error or recording observation error). The key advantage to this approach was its power to detect statistically significant population level patterns and trends among individual level data on plan attributes. 258:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The 29 PeRcEnT of the area of the United States that is in public land contains a rich store of biotic and abiotic resources available to its owners the American people. Deciding whether how and by whom these resources are to be used is the foremost challenge facing those who set public policy for natural resources. A number of land management agencies are vested with the responsibility of carrying out the prescriptions of public policy and have or had until recently research arms charged with providing scientific information to enlighten policymaking and management. Ecologists understand very well that deciding whether and how public resources are to be used__that is the process of setting public policy__is highly contentious because of the differing values attached to these resources by different subsets of American society. Those values commonly conflict and resolution is not often mutually satisfactory. It is also not news to ecologists that the structure and function of biological resources as well as the responses to their use and management are among the most complex issues addressed by the field of ecology. Policy setting is most likely to be rational and socially optimal if this complexity is thoroughly elucidated by accurate and objective research. This is not to say that policies are set only on the basis of science. As Sabatier states No policy decision can be based solely on technical information. Normative elements invariably enter. But if not enlightened by quality research policy is based on guess hearsay and traditional knowledge and ultimately is determined by power politics. Thus the research carried out to enlighten the policymaking process not only copes with the conceptual and methodological challenges posed by the complexity of its subject matter but is commonly conducted in the contentious climate of policy disputes within which the agencies function. As a result agency researchers often struggle to produce the accurate and objective research that is needed to fully enlighten the policy process and management. These efforts are often successful as shown by a long history of distinguished research on many natural resources issues. Hence I find extremely disturbing the continuing flow of literature describing instances in which research is manipulated to support agency policy positions. One of the most recent and troubling is a book by Todd Wilkinson Science under Siege. It chronicles the cases of eight scientists in five federal agencies and one state agency who were ordered either to condone management actions they knew to be environmentally damaging and contrary to their agencies mandates; rewrite environmental documents which would condone management actions inimical to resource protection; make public statements contrary to their professional judgment that proposed activities would damage resources; or simply remain silent. These are admittedly extreme cases used by Wilkinson to call attention to the problem. But on the basis of his investigations he believes that the problem is widespread although generally more subtle than indicated by the egregious instances described in his book. In those cases the agencies were facilitating or supporting land use actions by private economic interests that the scientists who spoke out considered detrimental to the natural resources in their care. In most cases the economic interests sought the support of politically influential persons to pressure the agencies under the threat of discontinued funding into silencing transferring or dismissing the employees who were attempting to protect the resources. I argue in this article that agency research is more likely to be objective if it is conducted at some administrative distance from the policymaking process either in a separate division or other administrative structure or carried out in an organization that does not have sole responsibility for setting policy internally. I conclude with a case study of the difficulty of getting scientific objectivity when research is conducted in or controlled by the administrative body that sets policy.  259:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The growing recognition that the species extinction crisis has deepened and that there are limited conservation dollars to address this crisis has had a profound influence on the planning methods and conservation strategies of governmental and nongovernmental organizations. For example World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Conservation International have pinpointed priority ecoregions and biodiversity hotspots respectively that represent some of the most significant remaining regions for conserving the worlds biological diversity. Both The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and World Wildlife Fund have set conservation priorities at the scale of large watersheds for freshwater ecosystems in the United States. The National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) of the US Geological Surveys Biological Resources Division is using biological survey data remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) technology at the state level to identify those native species and ecosystems that are not adequately represented in existing conservation lands__in other words the aim of the program is to detect conservation gaps. Some state governments in the United States are also developing their own biodiversity conservation plans. Internationally more than 175 countries are mandated as signatories to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity to prepare National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans. All of these assessments and priority setting exercises have a common trait: They focus on relatively large spatial areas or regions inhabited by thousands of species and hundreds of identifiable natural communities.To implement conservation actions on priorities identified in these coarse scale assessments requires a practical yet science based planning framework for the conservation of biodiversity within these regions. Recognizing that most conservation efforts are reactive and that its own conservation investments needed to be more strategic The Nature Conservancy has been developing such a framework for conservation planning in terrestrial freshwater and near shore marine environments. This framework has been tested and revised through the preparation and implementation of over 45 ecoregional and regional conservation plans in the United States Latin America the Caribbean Micronesia and Yunnan China. The frameworks methods are based on theories and principles from ecology and conservation biology and have been developed in consultations with scientists from research natural resource management and conservation institutions and organizations. It has been applied across many types of ecosystems by numerous scientists and practitioners under a variety of levels of funding and availability of information. In this article we report the lessons learned from implementing TNCs planning framework as a model for the many agencies and institutions around the world that face similar challenges in conservation planning. Four significant scientific advances in the last decade of the 20th century have shaped the development of this framework. First the growing list of endangered species highlighted the need for approaches to conservation that are proactive and complement the reactive measures of most endangered species programs. Second scientists increasingly recognized the importance of conserving the underlying ecological processes that support the patterns of biological diversity. Third we began to realize that biodiversity occurs at multiple spatial scales and levels of biological organization and that a greater emphasis to conserve this diversity must be placed at all appropriate levels and scales. Finally we learned that systematic conservation planning approaches are more effective at conserving biological diversity than are the ad hoc approaches of the past. These ad hoc approaches have resulted in a biased distribution of lands and waters set aside for conservation purposes with the majority of these areas occurring at relatively higher elevations and on steeper slopes and poorer soils. TNCs seven step conservation planning framework incorporates all four of these scientific advances. We have applied the framework to ecoregions__large areas of the earths surface that have similarities in faunal and floral composition due to large scale predictable patterns of solar radiation and moisture. Most ecoregional classifications are based upon criteria such as climate soils geology vegetation cover types or in the case of marine systems oceanographic factors because these environmental variables are assumed to have a major influence on the evolutionary history and distribution of many species and communities. The US Forest Service and the US Environ mental Protection Agency developed ecoregional classifications for the United States and the World Wildlife Fund has done so for every continent. For this planning framework we used a modified version of Baileys ecoregions for the United States and relied on WWFs ecoregional classifications for other countries. Although intended for application at an ecoregional scale this framework should be applicable to other types of planning regions  Conservation Internationals biodiversity hotspots) at similar spatial scales.Redford and colleagues (forthcoming) provide an overview of approaches that various organizations use to conserve biodiversity including the spatial scale at which these different approaches are intended to operate. The primary product of applying this framework is the identification of a portfolio or network of lands and waters for conserving the elements of biodiversity within an ecoregion. We refer to these lands and waters as conservation areas. We separate the identification of conservation areas from their design and management.We emphasize that the primary purpose of regional scale conservation planning as articulated in this article is to identify a set of conservation areas that best represents the native species and ecosystems of the region and the underlying ecological processes that sustain them. Determining how those areas are best designed and managed requires a more detailed analysis usually at finer spatial scales. Planning at the scale of conservation areas  Nature Conservancy preserve national park national or state wildlife refuge) aims to maintain or improve the ecological condition of targeted biological or environmental features of these areas and to abate threats to these features. Noss and Cooperrider and Meffe and Carroll provide overviews of the design and management of conservation areas.  265:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,265:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological field stations in North America have significant potential for addressing the most pressing environmental challenges facing science and society. Many of these field stations are now actively engaged in research networks and developing environmental observatory networks. The Resource Discovery Initiative for Field Stations (RDIFS) represents a research coordination network developed to enhance data management capacity and better position field stations for the critical role they are to play in addressing environmental challenges. The RDIFS developed information resources and training programs to facilitate storage discovery and access to data and information that are collectively held at North American biological field stations. In this article we highlight the capabilities and needs of biological field stations identify specific data management challenges faced by field stations describe the products of the RDIFS effort and provide insight into the future of data management at field stations especially in relation to participation in environmental observatory networks. 266:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Canadas Species at Risk Act (SARA) and the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) have adopted different approaches to achieve overlapping goals. We compare the ESA and SARA focusing on the roles of science and policy in determining which species warrant legal protection. Our analysis suggests that each act could benefit from mimicking the strengths of the other and both could be strengthened by greater clarity and transparency of listing determinations. A particular strength of SARA is that all evaluations of species status are conducted by a single national scientific body. The ESA does not involve a comparable national body but has more stringent legal deadlines for listing actions and listing decisions cannot by law consider socioeconomic factors (as can occur under SARA). The conservation of biodiversity would be enhanced if both acts were complemented by additional programs focused on broader efforts that protect more species before individual intervention is needed. 270:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,272:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,276:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Protected areas are the single most important conservation tool. The global protected area network has grown substantially in recent decades now occupying 11.5 PeRcEnT of Earths land surface but such growth has not been strategically aimed at maximizing the coverage of global biodiversity. In a previous study we demonstrated that the global network is far from complete even for the representation of terrestrial vertebrate species. Here we present a first attempt to provide a global framework for the next step of strategically expanding the network to cover mammals amphibians freshwater turtles and tortoises and globally threatened birds. We identify unprotected areas of the world that have remarkably high conservation value (irreplaceability) and are under serious threat. These areas concentrate overwhelmingly in tropical and subtropical moist forests particularly on tropical mountains and islands. The expansion of the global protected area network in these regions is urgently needed to prevent the loss of unique biodiversity. 277:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,277:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Protected area targets of 10 PeRcEnT of a biome of a country or of the planet have often been used in conservation planning. The new World Database on Protected Areas shows that terrestrial protected area coverage now approaches 12 PeRcEnT worldwide. Does this mean that the establishment of new protected areas can cease? This was the core question of the   Building Comprehensive Protected Area Systems   stream of the Fifth World Parks Congress in Durban South Africa in 2003. To answer it requires global gap analysis the subject of the special section of BioScience for which this article serves as an introduction. We also provide an overview of the extraordinary data sets now available to allow global gap analysis and based on these an assessment of the degree to which existing protected area systems represent biodiversity. Coverage varies geographically but is less than 2 PeRcEnT for some bioregions and more than 12 PeRcEnT of 11 633 bird mammal amphibian and turtle species are wholly unrepresented.

The subsurface retention of oil as finely dispersed droplets and emulsions wellhead injection of dispersants and deepwater retention of plumes of natural gas undergoing rapid microbial degradation were unprecedented and demanded the development of a new model for deepwater well blowouts that includes subsurface consequences. Existing governmental programs and policies had not anticipated this new theater of impacts which thereby challenged decisionmaking on the spill response on the assessment of natural resource damages on the preparation for litigation to achieve compensation for public trust losses and on restoration. Modification of laws and policies designed to protect and restore ocean resources is needed in order to accommodate oil drilling in the deep sea and other frontiers. 282:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The conservation and sustainable use of marine resources is a highlighted goal on a growing number of national and international policy agendas. Unfortunately efforts to assess progress as well as to strategically plan and prioritize new marine conservation measures have been hampered by the lack of a detailed comprehensive biogeographic system to classify the oceans. Here we report on a new global system for coastal and shelf areas: the Marine Ecoregions of the World or MEOW a nested system of 12 realms 62 provinces and 232 ecoregions. This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications. The designation of terrestrial ecoregions has revolutionized priority setting and planning for terrestrial conservation; we anticipate similar benefits from the use of a coherent and credible marine system. 2:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,304:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,308:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,310:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,315:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,31:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,323:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation objectives aimed at maintaining the diversity of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are often expressed as a desire to ensure that spawner abundance is spread out over a number of spawning sites. However sampling is not usually possible at all sites or in all years. For such incomplete data sets rotating panel sampling designs and hierarchical estimation models have been suggested as ways to improve monitoring performance. To evaluate the potential benefits of using these approaches to assess the conservation status of coho salmon (O. kisutch) we developed a simulation procedure that modelled spatial and temporal variation in salmon abundance at multiple sites within a region. Results show that both approaches were largely unsuccessful at reducing classification errors for conservation status. Furthermore indicators describing distributions of abundance levels and temporal trends in abundance within a region were more sensitive to missing data than to observation error variance on annual abundance estimates. Thus sampling effort might be better spent reducing the level of missing data within a regional data set as opposed to obtaining more precise estimates for only a few site year combinations. Our results also show that the best monitoring plans for regions depend on monitoring objectives as well as the relative magnitudes of spatial and temporal variability. 329:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,343:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,352:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,358:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,360:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This special issue on ecosystem based management (EBM) an outcome of a National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) working group consists of six case studies two comparative analyses and a synthetic essay.

We discuss concerns about the effects on the study design of inherent differences between the oiled and unoiled areas; about interpretations of results that use inconsistent criteria to define the spatial scales of analysis; and about explanations of underlying causes that are not empirically founded. These comments highlight general difficulties in assessing the effects of large scale environmental perturbations. It is important to draw conclusions about the effects of such events but the conclusions must be founded on accuracy in reporting study results caution in interpreting the results and adequate consideration of alternative causal explanations for the observed results. 382:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Genetic diversity is the foundation for all biological diversity; the persistence and evolutionary potential of species depend on it. World leaders have agreed on the conservation of genetic diversity as an explicit goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Nevertheless actions to protect genetic diversity are largely lacking. With only months left to the 2010 biodiversity target when the 191 parties to the CBD have agreed on achieving a significant reduction of the rate of biodiversity loss gene level diversity is still not being monitored and indicators and thresholds that can be used to devise strategies to conserve this important component of biodiversity are missing. Immediate action is needed to ensure that genetic diversity is not neglected in conservation targets beyond 2010. The risks associated with depletion of genetic diversity were recognized in classic publications 4 decades ago and this message has been repeatedly stressed ever since. In that time a body of theory and empirical work has emerged that demonstrates how populations and even species can collapse due to loss of genetic diversity. Evidence supporting the importance of maintaining genetic variation to sustain species and ecosystems continues to accumulate. Gene level biodiversity is recognized in the CBD as one of three levels of diversity__ ecosystems species and genes__that are to be conserved and sustainably used. Since its adoption in 1992 this convention has become the most important international political instrument for halting biodiversity loss. At present 192 nations are parties to the CBD representing every nation in the world except for Andorra the Holy See (the Vatican) Somalia (party from mid December 2009) and the United States. Integral to the CBD is the task of monitor ing through sampling and other techniques the components of biological diversity to identify processes and categories of activities which have or are likely to have significant adverse impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and monitor their effects. In 2002 parties to the CBD committed themselves to reduce significantly by 2010 the current rates of biodiversity loss at global regional and national levels as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on Earth. This 2010 biodiversity target was subsequently endorsed by the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the United Nations General Assembly and incorporated as a new target under the UN Millennium Development Goals. To evaluate progress toward the 2010 biodiversity target for genetic variation it is necessary to assess and monitor this critical level of diversity. The CBD is not a mandatory instrument; it is the responsibility of each country to develop and implement a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). To assess the extent to which genetic diversity is currently recognized in national biodiversity policy programs we used information available at the conventions website to review NBSAPs of a subset of countries party to the CBD. Our aim was to investigate whether individual parties state in their strategies and action plans that genetic variation of wild animals and plants is to be conserved in their country and whether they explicitly recognize the need for developing monitoring programs for this diversity. For our analysis we selected every 10th country ranked according to its gross national product. If a country was not part of the CBD or not a sovereign nation or if a document was missing not searchable or not in English we chose the next country on the list. We reviewed 24 NBSAPs. Of these 67 PeRcEnT (16 countries) state that genetic variation should be conserved. Nevertheless 38 PeRcEnT (six) of these plans focus only on the genetic diversity of domesticated populations compared with 62 PeRcEnT (10) that also recognize the genetic diversity of wild animals and plants as a conservation concern. Although most (90%; 21 countries) of the reviewed NBSAPs state that monitoring of biodiversity should be carried out only 21 PeRcEnT (five) explicitly acknowledge the need for developing means for monitoring diversity at the genetic level. These five countries all grouped in the upper 20 PeRcEnT of the GNP ranking  larger countries with strong economic performance). In contrast countries sharing the general goal of conserving genetic diversity represent the full spectrum of GNP ranks. This pattern of widespread recognition of the genetic component of biodiversity but a primary concern for gene pools of domesticated organisms is also reflected among four rapidly developing countries predicted to eclipse the combined economies of the current richest countries of the world by 2050: Brazil Russia India and China. We separately examined the NBSAPs for the BRIC countries and found that only one of them (Russia) explicitly stresses the need for developing monitoring programs for each level of biodiversity including genetic variation. Existing national plans for implementation of the CBD genetic diversity goal clearly are insufficient. Less than half of the reviewed countries have included explicitly the goal of conserving genetic variation of wild animals and plants and only 20 PeRcEnT recognize the need for monitoring this level of variation. Failure to maintain genetic diversity undermines efforts to maintain diversity at all other levels. International support and effort are urgently needed to monitor all components of diversity including genetic diversity. Several international facilities have been created to assist countries in implementing the CBD. Currently however these facilities fail to provide adequate information or assistance to help countries implement the CBD with respect to gene level variation. For instance the World Conservation Monitoring Center which is run in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme does not deal with gene level biodiversity. Similarly the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) created to collect and provide free and open access to biodiversity data is not constructed to deal with information on gene level biodiversity. To meet the 2010 biodiversity target several efforts have been made to identify indicators useful for detecting changes in species and ecosystem diversity. For instance the 2010 Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (http: www.twentyten.net) brings together a host of international organizations working at the forefront of biodiversity indicator development to assess progress toward the 2010 target. The only indicator that explicitly deals with genetic variation focuses on ex situ crop collections and the number of food production breeds of domestic animals. Similarly among the 11 indicators of status trends and threats to biodiversity proposed by the Pan European initiative Streamlining European 2010 Biodiversity Indicators the one indicator focusing on genetic variation deals exclusively with the number of domestic livestock breeds within countries. It does not monitor the genetic diversity within breeds let alone genetic diversity in domesticated plants or any wild species. The Global Environment Facility (GEF)__the designated financial mechanism for a number of multilateral environmental agreements and conventions including the CBD__has funded only seven projects that explicitly deal with genetic diversity among a total of 2471 funded projects (0.3 PeRcEnT of the funded projects and 0.2 PeRcEnT of the funds awarded by GEF). All seven projects deal with genetic diversity exploited in agriculture or forestry. Knowledge of conservation genetics as well as molecular genetic techniques and statistical tools to detect loss of genetic variation through genetic monitoring of species and populations exist and can be implemented. As we move to devise conservation targets beyond 2010 we urge all nations and international conservation programs to recognize the central importance of conserving genetic diversity. Currently Sweden appears to stand alone among CBD nations in having started to develop explicit conservation strategies to conserve genetic diversity although these have not yet been put into practice. There is an urgent need for consensus on standards for genetic monitoring as an explicit component of CBD implementation (Laikre . 2008) and international as well as national efforts from both policy makers and researchers are needed in this respect. Without meaningful indicators and targets for conservation of this critical component of biodiversity adaptive potential of all wild and domesticated species is likely to continue to erode. In 2009 we celebrated Charles Darwins 200 birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species. One of Darwins key insights crucial to the explanation of adaptation following natural selection was the importance of variation among individuals within populations. It is time for the importance of genetic variation for evolutionary processes to be taken into consideration in the development of international policy to conserve biodiversity.  384:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The major challenge in tropical land management is to meet the ever growing demand for agricultural products while conserving biodiversity providing critical ecosystem services and maintaining rural livelihoods. This challenge is particularly acute in the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot a region of high conservation value for both wild and domesticated species that is undergoing rapid human population growth ecological degradation and loss of traditional farming systems. Approximately 80 PeRcEnT of the regions vegetation has been converted to agriculture threatening biodiversity. More than 300 of the regions endemic species of flora and fauna are threatened including at least 107 that are critically endangered. With continuing habitat loss (deforestation is 1.2 PeRcEnT year in Central America and Mexico combined) and fragmentation of remaining forests pressure on the regions biodiversity will intensify. Habitat destruction and fragmentation are not the only drivers of biodiversity loss in the region however. Globalization of market forces agricultural industrialization migration public policy and cultural changes are driving the transformation of diverse traditional smallholder agroecosystems into agroindustrial systems dependent on chemical inputs and mechanization. Agroindustrial intensification is often accompanied by significant reductions in tree cover fallow vegetation habitat diversity and forest connectivity. These transformations directly threaten species dependent on natural habitat and undermine indigenous management practices that coevolved with this biodiversity for over 10 000 years. Despite considerable efforts to protect biodiversity in reserves and parks in Mesoamerica many of these refuges are small fragmented isolated or poorly protected and not all ecosystems or species are represented adequately. Besides having inadequate dimensions most protected areas are embedded within an agricultural landscape and existing buffer zones are inadequate to alleviate effects of fragmentation contamination by agrochemicals hunting and unsustainable or illegal logging. The fate of biodiversity within protected areas is therefore inextricably linked to the broader landscape context including how the surrounding agricultural matrix is designed and managed. Protecting biodiversity while sustaining agricultural productivity indigenous cultures and rural livelihoods requires a new approach to conservation particularly in regions such as Mesoamerica where substantial habitat conversion has already occurred. In contrast to the prevailing trend of managing protected areas and productive lands separately we propose integrated landscape management in which conservation and production units within the agricultural matrix are managed jointly for long term sustainability. We do not advocate agricultural intensification to spare further forest conversion because this approach is unlikely to have the intended outcome for reasons discussed elsewhere. Instead conservation efforts should be based on the recognition that how agriculture is conducted and how different land uses are distributed spatially and temporally determine the regions biodiversity. Lasting conservation will therefore require alliances among conservation biologists farmers and land managers to actively plan the future of Mesoamerican landscapes. Here we use an integrated landscape approach to highlight opportunities for achieving long term conservation in Mesoamerica. We provide an overview of the potential for agricultural landscapes and traditional smallholder farming to conserve biodiversity propose an urgent action agenda to guide conservation in agricultural landscapes and stem the loss of biodiversity and traditional farming systems and outline key socioeconomic legal and political conditions needed for successful implementation of the action plan. Although our examples and recommendations focus on Mesoamerica our approach is relevant to other regions where there are similar challenges to conserving biodiversity in human modified landscapes.  387:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Animal and plant population monitoring programs are critical for identifying species at risk evaluating the effects of management or harvest and tracking invasive and pest species. Nevertheless monitoring activities are highly decentralized which makes it difficult for researchers or conservation planners to get a good general picture of what real world monitoring programs actually entail. We used a Web based survey to collect information on population monitoring programs. The survey focused on basic questions about each program including motivations for monitoring types of data being collected spatiotemporal design of the program and reasons for choosing that design. We received responses from 311 people involved in monitoring of various species and used these responses to summarize ongoing monitoring efforts. We also used responses to determine whether monitoring strategies have changed over time and whether they differed among monitoring agencies. Most commonly monitoring entailed collection of count data at multiple sites with the primary goal of detecting trends. But we also found that goals and strategies for monitoring appeared to be diversifying that area occupied and presence absence approaches appeared to be gaining in popularity and that several other promising approaches (monitoring to reduce parameter uncertainty risk based monitoring and directly linking monitoring data to management decisions) have yet to become widely established. We suggest that improved communication between researchers studying monitoring designs and those who are charged with putting these designs into practice could further improve monitoring programs and better match sampling designs to the objectives of monitoring programs. 390:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Charismatic groups of animals and plants often are proposed as sentinels of environmental status and trends. Nevertheless many claims that a certain taxonomic group can provide more general information on environmental quality are not evaluated critically. To address several of the many definitions of indicator species we used butterflies to explore in some detail the attributes that affect implementation of indicators generically. There probably are few individual species or sets of species that can serve as scientifically valid cost effective measures of the status or trend of an environmental phenomenon that is difficult to measure directly. Nevertheless there are species with distributions abundances or demographic characteristics that are responsive to known environmental changes. In this context single or multiple species can serve as indicators when targets are defined explicitly ecological relationships between the target and the putative indicators are well understood and data are sufficient to differentiate between deterministic and stochastic responses. Although these situations exist they are less common than might be apparent from an extensive and often confounded literature on indicators. Instead the public appeal of charismatic groups may be driving much of their acclaim as indicators. The same taxon may not be appropriate for marketing a general conservation mission and for drawing strong inference about specific environmental changes. To provide insights into the progress of conservation efforts it is essential to identify scientific and practical criteria for selection and application of indicators and then to examine whether a given taxonomic group meets those criteria. 391:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,392:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change poses a challenge to the conventional approach to biodiversity conservation which relies on fixed protected areas because the changing climate is expected to shift the distribution of suitable areas for many species. Some species will persist only if they can colonize new areas although in some cases their dispersal abilities may be very limited. To address this problem we devised a quantitative method for identifying multiple corridors of connectivity through shifting habitat suitabilities that seeks to minimize dispersal demands first and then the area of land required. We applied the method to Proteaceae mapped on a 1 minute grid for the western part of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa to supplement the existing protected areas using Worldmap software. Our goal was to represent each species in at least 35 grid cells (approximately 100 km(2)) at all times between 2000 and 2050 despite climate change. Although it was possible to achieve the goal at reasonable cost caution will be needed in applying our method to reserves or other conservation investments until there is further information to support or refine the climate change models and the species habitat suitability and dispersal models. 394:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation organizations and public agencies are interested in identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation action often acquisition or easements. Typically this requires the use of uncertain data and vaguely defined decision criteria. I developed a decision support system to address these uncertainty issues and assist in evaluating conservation opportunities for the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) in Santa Barbara California. Functionally defined planning units were used to aggregate data on land suitability land cover change salamander presence and movement risk along potential linkages between breeding ponds. I used a fuzzy logic based inference engine to evaluate the planning units and rank the relative suitability of interpond linkages for conservation action. The sensitivity of the rankings was considered with respect to uncertainty in salamander occurrence data and the relationship between land cover change threats and site suitability. All linkages were substantially degraded but five areas were consistently identified with high relative suitability for conservation action despite differences in assumptions and uncertainty in biological data. The combination of functionally defined planning units and a fuzzy logic based decision support system provides a general framework for considering the suitability of sites for conservation action. 397:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,3:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Assessments for assigning the conservation status of threatened species that are based purely on subjective judgements become problematic because assessments can be influenced by hidden assumptions personal biases and perceptions of risks making the assessment process difficult to repeat. This can result in inconsistent assessments and misclassifications which can lead to a lack of confidence in species assessments. It is almost impossible to Understand an experts logic or visualise the underlying reasoning behind the many hidden assumptions used throughout the assessment process. In this paper we formalise the decision making process of experts by capturing their logical ordering of information their assumptions and reasoning and transferring them into a set of decisions rules. We illustrate this through the process used to evaluate the conservation status of species under the NatureServe system (Master 1991). NatureServe status assessments have been used for over two decades to set conservation priorities for threatened species throughout North America. We develop a conditional point scoring method to reflect the current subjective process. In two test comparisons 77 PeRcEnT of species assessments using the explicit NatureServe method matched the qualitative assessments done subjectively by NatureServe staff. Of those that differed no rank varied by more than one rank level under the two methods. In general the explicit NatureServe method tended to be more precautionary than the subjective assessments. The rank differences that emerged from the comparisons may be due at least in part to the flexibility of the qualitative system which allows different factors to be weighted on a species by species basis according to expert judgement. The method outlined in this study is the first documented attempt to explicitly define a transparent process for weighting and combining factors under the NatureServe system. The process of eliciting expert knowledge identifies how information is combined and highlights any inconsistent logic that may not be obvious in Subjective decisions. The method provides a repeatable transparent and explicit benchmark for feedback further development and improvement. 401:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Expanding habitat protection is a common tactic for species conservation. When unprotected habitat is privately owned decisions must be made about which areas to protect by land purchase or conservation easement. To address this problem we developed an optimization framework for choosing the habitat protection strategy that minimizes the risk of population extinction subject to an upper bound on funding. The framework is based on the idea that an extinction risk function that predicts the relative effects of varying the quantity and quality of habitat can be estimated from the results of a demographic model of population viability. We used the framework to address the problem of expanding the protected habitat of a core population of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) in the Panoche area in central California. We first developed a stochastic demographic model of the kit fox population. Predictions from the simulation model were used to estimate an extinction risk function that depended on areas of good and fair quality habitat. The risk function was combined with costs of habitat protection to determine cost efficient protection strategies and risk cost curves showing how extinction risk could be reduced at minimum cost for increasing levels of funding. One important result was that cost efficient shares of the budget used to protect different types of habitat changed as the budget increased and depended on the relative costs of available habitat and the relative effects of habitat protection on extinction risk. Another important finding was the sensitivity of the location and slope of the risk cost curve to assumptions about the spatial configuration of available habitat. When the location and slope of the risk cost curve are sensitive to model assumptions resulting predictions of extinction risk and risk reduction per unit cost should be used very cautiously in ranking conservation options among different species or populations. The application is an example of how the results of a complex demographic model of population viability can be synthesized for use in optimization analyses to determine cost efficient habitat protection strategies and risk cost tradeoffs. 403:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Little is known about how specific anthropogenic hazards affect the biology of organisms. Quantifying the effect of regional hazards is particularly challenging for species such as sea turtles because they are migratory difficult to study long lived and face multiple anthropogenic threats. Expert elicitation a technique used to synthesize opinions of experts while assessing uncertainty around those views has been in use for several decades in the social science and risk assessment sectors. We conducted an internet based survey to quantify expert opinion on the relative magnitude of anthropogenic hazards to sea turtle populations at the regional level. Fisheries bycatch and coastal development were most often ranked as the top hazards to sea turtle species in a geographic region. Nest predation and direct take followed as the second and third greatest threats respectively. Survey results suggest most experts believe sea turtles are threatened by multiple factors including substantial at sea threats such as fisheries bycatch. Resources invested by the sea turtle community however appear biased toward terrestrial based impacts. Results from the survey are useful for conservation planning because they provide estimates of relative impacts of hazards on sea turtles and a measure of consensus on the magnitude of those impacts among researchers and practitioners. Our survey results also revealed patterns of expert bias which we controlled for in our analysis. Respondents with no experience with respect to a sea turtle species tended to rank hazards affecting that sea turtle species higher than respondents with experience. A more striking pattern was with hazard based expertise: the more experience a respondent had with a specific hazard the higher the respondent scored the impact of that hazard on sea turtle populations. Bias controlled expert opinion surveys focused on threatened species and their hazards can help guide and expedite species recovery plans. 404:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Management of nonindigenous species is a crucial aspect of maintaining native biodiversity and normal ecosystem functions. We attempt to guide researchers in developing projects that will be of use to conservation practitioners tangibly improving applied conservation measures. We advocate a directed approach for conservation research to aid in prioritizing nonindigenous species for intervention by resource managers. This approach includes outlining what needs to be known to make such relative judgments about the impacts of nonindigenous species and the most promising methods by which to obtain such information. We also address active measures that should be taken once priorities have been set highlighting the roles of risk assessment and research in improving control efforts. Ultimately a better match between research and practical conservation needs should result in more effective reduction of the effects of nonindigenous species on native species. 405:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many different systems are used to assess levels of threat faced by species. Prominent ones are those used by the World Conservation Union NatureServe and the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission (now the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission). These systems assign taxa a threat ranking by assessing their demographic and ecological characteristics. These threat rankings support the legislative protection of species and guide the placement of conservation programs in order of priority. It is not known however whether these assessment systems rank species in a similar order To resolve this issue we assessed 55 mainly vertebrate taxa with widely differing life histories under each of these systems and determined the rank correlations among them. Moderate significant positive correlations were seen among the threat rankings provided by the three systems (correlations 0.58 0.69). Further the threat rankings for taxa obtained using these systems were significantly correlated to their rankings based on predicted probability of extinction within 100 years as determined by population viability analysis (correlations 0.28 0.37). The different categorization systems then yield related but not identical threat rankings and these rankings are associated with predicted extinction risk. 406:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many scientists lament the absence of data for endangered species and argue that mno e funds should be spent acquiring basic information about population trends Using 19 years of abundance estimates for the eastern North Pacific gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) we sampled subsets of the original survey data to identify the number of years of data required to remove the population from the U;S. Endangered Species Acts (ESA) list of endangered and threatened wildlife. I;or any given duration of monitoring we selected all possible combinations of consecutive counts. To incorporate variability in growth rates we extracted a maximum likelihood estimator of growth rate and confidence interval about that growth rate on the assumption that the population changes can be approximated by a simple diffusion process with drift. We then applied a new approach to determine ESA status for each subset of survey data and found that a quantitative decision to delist is unambiguously supported by 11 years of data but is precariously uncertain with fewer than 10 years of data. The data needed to produce an unequivocal decision to delist gray whales cost the National Marine Fisheries Service an estimated U.S.  DoLlQuAnT 660 000 a surprisingly modest expense given the fact that delisting can greatly simplify regulatory constraints This example highlights the value of population monitoring in administering the ESA and provides a compelling example of the utility of such information in identifying both imperiled and recovered species. The economic value of such data is that they provide the foundation for delisting which could ultimately save much more money than the collection of the data would ever cost. 407:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine ecosystems are threatened by a suite of anthropogenic stressors. Mitigating multiple threats is a daunting task particularly when funding constraints limit the number of threats that can be addressed. Threats are typically assessed and prioritized via expert opinion workshops that often leave no record of the rationale for decisions making it difficult to update recommendations with new information. We devised a transparent repeatable and modifiable method for collecting expert opinion that describes and documents how threat ; affect marine ecosystems. Experts were asked to assess the functional impact scale and frequency of a threat to an ecosystem; the resistance and recovery time of an ecosystem to a threat; and the certainty of these estimates. To quantify impacts of 38 distinct anthropogenic threats on 23 marine ecosystems we surveyed 135 experts from 19 different countries. Survey results showed that all ecosystems are threatened by at least nine threats and that nine ecosystems are threatened by  90 PeRcEnT of existing threats. The greatest threats (highest impact scores) were increasing sea temperature demersal destructive fishing and point source organic pollution. Rocky reef coral reef hard shelf mangrove and offshore epipelagic ecosystems were identified as the most threatened. These general results however may be partly influenced by the specific expertise and geography of respondents and should be interpreted with caution. This approach to threat analysis can identify the greatest threats (globally or locally) most widespread threats most (or least) sensitive ecosystems most (or least) threatened ecosystems and other metrics of conservation value. Additionally it can be easily modified updated as new data become available and scaled to local or regional settings which would facilitate informed and transparent conservation priority setting. 411:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,412:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Several international conservation organizations have recently produced global priority maps to guide conservation activities and spending in their own and other conservation organizations. Surprisingly it is not possible to directly evaluate the relationship between priorities and spending within a given organization because none of the organizations with global priority models tracks how they spend their money relative to their priorities. We were able however to evaluate the spending patterns of five other large biodiversity conservation organizations without their own published global priority models and investigate the potential influence of priority models on this spending. On average countries with priority areas received greater conservation investment; global prioritization systems however explained between only 2 and 32 PeRcEnT of the US DoLlQuAnT 1.5 billion spent in 2002 depending on whether the United States was removed from analyses and whether conservation spending was adjusted by the per capita gross domestic product within each country. We also found little overlap in the spending patterns of the five conservation organizations evaluated suggesting that informal coordination or segregation of effort may be occurring. Our results also highlight a number of potential gaps and mismatches in how limited conservation funds are spent and provide the first audit of global conservation spending patterns. More explicit presentation of conservation priorities by organizations currently without priority models and better tracking of spending by those with published priorities are clearly needed to help make future conservation activities as efficient as possible. 414:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial autocorrelation statistics can provide an efficient tool for exploring taxonomic patterns in extinction risk. Using Morans I we found that U.S. vertebrates exhibit little or no taxonomic clustering of extinction threat within orders but much greater clustering within families and genera. Among amphibians clustering was unusually high within families. Across classes most groups had a similar degree of clustering at all taxonomic levels despite their different evolutionary histories. Birds were the exception with higher clustering at the genus and family level. Our results suggest that intrinsic traits play a large role in species endangerment. The taxonomic pattern produced can guide policymakers in their allocation of scarce conservation dollars and in their efforts to develop pre emptive conservation programs. 416:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,416:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Systematic protocols that use decision rules or scores arc seen to improve consistency and transparency in classifying the conservation status of species. When applying these protocols assessors are typically required to decide on estimates for attributes That are inherently uncertain Input data and resulting classifications are usually treated as though they arc exact and hence without operator error We investigated the impact of data interpretation on the consistency of protocols of extinction risk classifications and diagnosed causes of discrepancies when they occurred. We tested three widely used systematic classification protocols employed by the World Conservation Union NatureServe and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. We provided 18 assessors with identical information for 13 different species to infer estimates for each of the required parameters for the three protocols. The threat classification of several of the species varied from low risk to high risk depending on who did the assessment. This occurred across the three Protocols investigated. Assessors tended to agree on their placement of species in the highest (50 70 PeRcEnT) and lowest risk categories (20 40 PeRcEnT) but There was poor agreement on which species should be placed in the intermediate categories Furthermore the correspondence between The three classification methods was unpredictable with large variation among assessors. These results highlight the importance of peer review and consensus among multiple assessors in species classifications and the need to be cautious with assessments carried out 4) a single assessor Greater consistency among assessors requires wide use of training manuals and formal methods for estimating parameters that allow uncertainties to be represented carried through chains of calculations and reported transparently. 417:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The application of systematic and quantitative approaches to conservation planning is increasing but the quality and quantity of data available to planners remains inadequate. We used two databases on bat species distributions at 25 sites in Paraguay to illustrate some of the effects of the spatial scale of sampling and data quality on decisions about reserve siting. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify alternative scenarios for comprehensive representation of the nations bat fauna within a system of reserves and to evaluate the contribution of existing protected areas in Paraguay to this conservation goal. The location efficiency and level of protection  the number of populations of each species protected) were affected by both spatial scale and source of data. Our results suggest that systematic and intensive biodiversity surveys are an important element of efficient conservation planning for biodiversity conservation. 419:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The number of habitat conservation plans (HCP) has risen dramatically since the first plan was written over 18 years ago. Until recently no studies have quantitatively investigated the scientific foundations underlying these documents. As part of a larger study of HCPs we examined 43 plans primarily to assess the availability and use of scientific data and secondarily to determine the extent of involvement by and influence of independent scientists within the process. Specifically our analysis focused on five key steps taken when an HCP is developed: assessing status of a species determining take predicting the project effects mitigating for those effects and monitoring of take and mitigation. In general we found that the preparers of HCPs utilized existing scientific information fairly well with 60 PeRcEnT of plans not missing any available information described by our study as   starkly necessary.   The most common types of underutilized available data included those describing the influence of stochastic processes and habitat quality or quantity on species persistence. For many species however data on biology or status simply did not exist as demonstrated by the fact that we could locate quantitative population estimates for only 10 PeRcEnT of the species. Furthermore for 42 PeRcEnT of the species examined we had insufficient data and analysis to determine clearly how predicted take might effect the population. In many cases mitigation measures proposed to offset take frequently addressed the most important local threats to the species with moderately reliable strategies. Species with monitoring programs rated as sufficient had plans that proposed to collect a greater amount of   quantitative   data than did those programs rated insufficient. Finally when species   experts   were consulted plan quality was generally higher. Overall available scientific information in a majority of categories was fairly well utilized but for many species additional studies and more indepth analysis were required to provide adequate support for issuance of an incidental take permit. 420:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) is the focus of intense concern as a species threatened by the destruction and fragmentation of primary forest in the Pacific Northwest (U.S.A.). Aside from habitat concerns an additional peril exists for the species: the larger and snore aggressive Barred Owl (S. varia) is invading the Pacific Northwest and has the potential to overrun much of the range of the endangered species. We evaluated the dimensions of this potential invasion by using ecological niche models based on point occurrence data. With these tools we developed models with significant predictions for the native distributions of both Spotted and Barred owls (tested via independent occurrence data) and for the invasive range of Barred Owls. Overlap between the models for the two species suggests that most of the northern portion of the Spotted Owls distribution (south to about lest. 38 degrees N) is vulnerable to Barred Owl invasion. We present an example of the potential effects of species invasions on endangered species conservation. 421:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires that recovery plans establish   objective measurable   criteria on which to base listing decisions. Recovery plans are more effective if these criteria are clearly linked to the biology of species of interest. We reviewed recovery plans for 27 listed insect species. Recovery criteria for threatened and endangered insects were poorly linked to species biology. We used population viability analysis to develop quantitative recovery criteria for insects whose population sizes can be estimated and applied this framework in the context of a recently listed butterfly the Fenders blue (Icaricia icarioides fenderi). We used a simple diffusion approximation approach developed to estimate extinction risk from count based census data. The method assumes that future trends can be predicted based on current conditions and that observer error is minimal. Of 12 sites we surveyed for at least 8 years only one population had a high likelihood of persistence. Given observed variation in population growth rate (sigma(2) equals 0.79) and an initial population size of 300 butterflies a minimum average growth rate (lambda) of 1.83 would be needed for there to be a 95 PeRcEnT probability that a population would survive 100 years. As the number of independent sites increased the minimum lambda required to have a 95 PeRcEnT probability that at least a population at one site would survive 100 years declined. For downlisting we recommend that three independent sites be maintained or restored in each region of the Fenders blue with minimum average growth rates of at least lambda equals 1.55 over 10 years. Given that 41 insect species are listed under the ESA development of quantitative recovery criteria would be useful and feasible for at risk insect species whose population sizes can be estimated. 424:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To promote more effective recovery planning for species listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) the Society for Conservation Biology sponsored a systematic review of a large sample of ESA recovery plans. The review was conducted in collaboration with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and 19 universities. We describe the genesis of the project and the development of the resulting database of information on ESA recovery plans. The projects primary goals were to characterize the content and attributes of recovery plans; to identify important differences patterns and trends among plans; and to use these results to develop recommendations for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service for improving recovery plans. We review key findings from published analyses of the project database and offer prioritized recommendations for improving recovery plan development and implementation. First the use of science in recovery plan development and implementation could be improved by making threats a primary focus of plans specifying adequate monitoring tasks for species status and recovery tasks and ensuring that species trend data are current quantitative and documented. Second recovery plan structure and development could be enhanced by keeping authorship teams small yet diverse making existing administrative designations more biologically relevant improving and standardizing the revision process and reevaluating the use of multispecies plans. Third agency resources and personnel could be better utilized by developing new recovery plan guidelines assigning personnel explicit responsibility for overseeing plan implementation expanding personnel training and tracking expenditures in recovery programs. And fourth several generic failings in the field of conservation biology could be addressed by reducing taxonomic bias and by collecting and fully integrating key biological information into recovery plans. The recovery plan project offers a model of how professional societies universities and government agencies can work together beneficially to address key issues in conservation biology. 426:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,427:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,427:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examined the relationship between authorship and the use of biological information in recovery plans under the U.S. Endangered Species Act Approximately one third of recovery plans were written solely by federal government employees and one third of plans included authors with university affiliations. The number of plans written strictly by federal staff increased significantly over time whereas the percentage of plans that included authors with university affiliation remained unchanged. We tested three hypotheses posed by Clark . (1994) regarding authorship and endangered species recovery and found that (1) groups of authors from diverse affiliations are likely to strengthen the recovery planning process (2) recovery plans lacking nonfederal participation suffer from inadequate attention to species biology and (3) academic affiliation is strongly associated with the use of focal species biology in recovery plans. Our results suggest that modifying the choice of participants in the recovery planning process may increase the use of biological information in recovery measures recommended in recovery plans and thus influence the eventual success of recovery efforts. 428:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We identified 100 scientific questions that if answered would have the greatest impact on conservation practice and policy. Representatives from 21 international organizations regional sections and working groups of the Society for Conservation Biology and 12 academics from all continents except Antarctica compiled 2291 questions of relevance to conservation of biological diversity worldwide. The questions were gathered from 761 individuals through workshops email requests and discussions. Voting by email to short list questions followed by a 2 day workshop was used to derive the final list of 100 questions. Most of the final questions were derived through a process of modification and combination as the workshop progressed. The questions are divided into 12 sections: ecosystem functions and services climate change technological change protected areas ecosystem management and restoration terrestrial ecosystems marine ecosystems freshwater ecosystems species management organizational systems and processes societal context and change and impacts of conservation interventions. We anticipate that these questions will help identify new directions for researchers and assist funders in directing funds. 433:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conflict and indecision are hallmarks of environmental policy formulation. Some argue that the requisite information and certainty fall short of scientific standards for decision making; others argue that science is not the issue and that indecisiveness reflects a lack of political willpower. One of the most difficult aspects of translating science into policy is scientific uncertainty. Whereas scientists are familiar with uncertainty and complexity the public and policy makers often seek certainty and deterministic solutions. We assert that environmental policy is most effective if scientific uncertainty is incorporated into a rigorous decision theoretic framework as knowledge not ignorance. The policies that best utilize scientific findings are defined here as those that accommodate the full scope of scientifically based predictions. 440:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,448:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The importance of genetic variation for maintaining biological diversity and evolutionary processes has been recognized by researchers for decades. This realization has prompted agreements by world leaders to conserve genetic diversity and this is an explicit goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Nevertheless very limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity on a global scale. International conservation efforts to halt biodiversity loss focus on habitats and species whereas little or no attention is paid to gene level variation. By this year 2010 world leaders have agreed that a significant reduction of the rate of biodiversity loss should have been achieved. However gene level diversity is still not monitored indicators that can help identify threats to genetic variation are missing and there is no strategy for how genetic aspects can be included in biodiversity targets beyond 2010. Important findings and conclusions from decades of conservation genetic research are not translated into concrete conservation action in the arena of international policy development. There is an urgent need for conservation geneticists worldwide to become involved in policy and practical conservation work beyond the universities and research institutions. 450:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,465:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,468:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,476:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,478:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,478:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In an era of global habitat loss and species extinction conservation biology is increasingly becoming a science of triage. A key approach has been the designation of global biodiversity hotspots areas of high species richness and endemism prioritizing regions that are disproportionately valuable. However traditional hotspot approaches leave absent information on species evolutionary histories. We argue that prioritizing the preservation of evolutionary diversity is one way to maximize genotypic and functional diversity providing ecosystems with the greatest number of options for dealing with an uncertain future. Global. We review methods for encapsulating phylogenetic diversity and distinctiveness and provide an illustration of how phylogenetic metrics can be extended to include data on geographical rarity and inform conservation prioritization at biogeographic scales. Abundance weighted metrics of evolutionary diversity can be used to simultaneously prioritize populations species habitats and biogeographical regions. Policy makers need to know where scarce conservation funds should be focused to maximize gains and minimize the loss of biological diversity. By incorporating these evolutionary diversity metrics into prioritization schemes managers can better quantify the valuation of different regions based on evolutionary information. 484:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Increasingly biogeographical knowledge and analysis are playing a fundamental role in assessing the representativeness of biodiversity in protected areas and in identifying critical areas for conservation. With almost 20 PeRcEnT of the country assigned to protected areas Chile is well above the conservation target  10 12 PeRcEnT) proposed by many international conservation organizations. Moreover the Chilean government has recently proposed new conservation priority sites to improve the current protected area network. Here we used all 653 terrestrial vertebrate species present in continental Chile to assess the performance of the existing and proposed reserve networks. Using geographical information systems we overlaid maps of species distribution current protected areas and proposed conservation priority sites to assess how well each species is represented within these networks. Additionally we performed a systematic reserve selection procedure to identify alternative conservation areas for expanding the current reserve system. Our results show that over 13 PeRcEnT of the species are not covered by any existing protected area and that 73 PeRcEnT of Chilean vertebrate species can be considered partial gaps with only a small fraction of their geographical ranges currently under protection. The coverage is also deficient for endemic (species confined to Chile) and threatened species. While the proposed priority sites do increase coverage we found that there are still several gaps and these are not the most efficient choices. Both the gap analysis and the reserve selection analysis identified important areas to be added to the existing reserve system mostly in northern and central Chile. This study underscores the need for a systematic conservation planning approach to redefine the conservation priority sites in order to maximize the representation of species particularly endemic and threatened species. 485:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,48:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,493:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,496:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,4:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In December 2000 the USDA Forest Service (USFS) commissioned a review of their process for conducting viability assessments under the National Forest Management Act (NFMA). The objectives of the USFS review were to establish the scientific basis for geographic and temporal scales used in the assessment of viability to identify and improve approaches that could be used to assess species viability within the context of NFMA and to describe the strengths and limitations of the approaches used in the viability assessment process. In this paper we present one aspect of this overall review: methods available and in use for selection of species at risk for the viability assessment process. A representative group of methods includes threatened and endangered species protocols such as the IUCN protocol the Heritage ranks the method devised by Millsap . (1990) to identify threatened and endangered species in Florida as well as protocols for narrower taxonomic and geographic ranges. We provide a description of each of the nine protocols reviewed and compare them in terms of their taxonomic and geographic range. biological attributes consideration of threats and population trends data requirements reliability and robustness transparency and ability to deal With Uncertainty. We found that all threatened and endangered species protocols are useful for classifying species at risk however those that explicitly include current and future threats are of most use in determining which species will be adversely affected by proposed management actions. We recommend that Heritage ranks be used to identify an initial set of candidate species for assessment of viability considerations with further refinement and supplementation based on species distributions relative to the scale of the planning area. 503:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The adoption of the National Resource Challenge (NR Challenge) as an action plan for preserving natural resources in national parks represents a monumental shift in the attitude toward and commitment to scientific research by the National Park Service (NPS). Historically the attitude toward scientific re search (and scientists) in national parks has varied widely among parks and was determined largely by the priorities of the park superintendent. While there are notable exceptions for the most part national parks have been an under exploited resource for ecological research. Now that there is a national man date to attract scientists to conduct and science in the properties managed by the NPS many of the logistical constraints and administrative obstacles that limited or pre vented ecologists from working in the parks are being removed. For example the permitting process has be come streamlined and is now accessible over the web. Information about park resources including the avail ability of and links to data on biological geopmorphological climatological and cultural resources in the national parks are now easily accessible over the web. These are important and necessary steps in making the parks and data about park resources more accessible to researchers. They also provide the framework for the establishment of rigorous scientific research pro grams that can take advantage of the diversity of habitats and broad spatial scales over which many patterns and processes occur in our national parks. Promoting the research agenda outlined in the NR Challenge and achieving the goal of getting the   good science and scientists   to work in national parks pre sent some serious challenges. Foremost among them is communicating this new philosophy to the scientific community encouraging and facilitating initial re search that will lead to the development of new programs and providing the funding to get new investigators to develop research projects in national parks. To meet these challenges the NPS has initiated an active outreach program to the scientific community to attract researchers to the parks. These include programs that target more senior scientists such as Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Units (CESUs) and the Sabbatical in the Parks program and research fellowships for pre and postdoctoral research in national parks. Both the CESU and Sabbatical in the Parks program are funded by the NPS. One goal of the NR Challenge is to provide financial support for these programs both directly and indirectly by enhancing the research infrastructure in the parks. However as Soukup points out there is a huge   intellectual backlog   in the understanding of how the ecological systems that occur in the parks operate. Even with the additional investment of funds provided by the NR Challenge more funding will be needed both to meet the needs of resource managers (  science for parks  ) and to develop a better under standing of the rich and diverse biological legacy that is preserved and protected in the natural areas of our national park system. The biggest challenge and largest potential payoff for the parks will be to promote and encourage opportunities that provide funding to attract new young scientists to conduct research in the Parks. Both the Canon Scholars and National Parks Ecological Re search (NPER) Fellowship Program are designed to meet this challenge. Both programs are funded by grants from private foundations (Canon and A. W. Mellon respectively) and importantly involve collaborations with professional scientific societies (American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS and Ecological Society of America ESA respectively). The involvement of these professional scientific societies in the selection of fellows for these programs is important for two reasons: it increases the visibility and impact of these programs within the NPS and it increases the awareness of the scientific com munity of the potential of the   parks for science.   When the Canon Scholars program was established in 1997 it was designed to enhance the   science for parks   program and did this by soliciting proposals in four focal areas identified in collaboration with park superintendents. Today it funds research in all areas of biological physical social and cultural science and technology innovation in support of conservation science and is not limited to issues important to park management. The NPER Fellowship Program has a narrower scientific focus than the Canon Scholars program in that it currently only funds projects in basic ecological sciences that focus on the flora of the parks. However the Mellon Foundation is supporting efforts by the National Parks Foundation to acquire additional support for the NPER program from other donors so that the taxonomic scope of the work supported by this program can be broadened. The third cohort of NPER fellows was selected in 2002 (a total of nine have been funded) and these individuals are working on a broad range of questions ranging from understanding controls on the biogeochemistry and N cycling of grasslands in Sequoia National Park to reconstructing historical pat terns of plant invasions in the Cape Cod National Sea shore to testing models of the evolution of mutualism with Senita cactus at Organic Pipe National Monument. One aspect of the NPER program that distinguishes it from the Canon Scholars Sabbatical in the Parks and CESU programs is that the focus is explicitly on   parks for science    not   science for parks.   The proposals are evaluated primarily on the scientific merit and creativity of the proposed work and credentials of the applicant. The applicants argument about the importance of the natural resources or ecological features of the proposed park (or parks) to the proposed research is also considered but the importance or relevance of the work for park management is not. In fact the application explicitly states:   Applicability of (the) re search for park management needs is not a criterion for selection.   The intent of this criteron is not to exclude proposals that could be done elsewhere (a reason frequently given in the past for rejecting research permits by some parks) but rather to raise the awareness of the value of our national parks for ecological research. This is a program in which the explicit intent it to support and encourage the use of national parks as sites for ecological research by new young investigators and by doing so to change the culture of support for basic research in both the parks and agencies that sup port ecological research. Two measures of the success of the NPER and Canon Scholars programs will be: Do the fellows continue to conduct research in national parks when they move into full time research or academic positions? and Are individuals (and mentors) who have not previously worked in national parks being attracted to this pro gram? While both these programs are still too young to evaluate them on these criteria their ultimate value to the parks will not be achieved until these goals are met. Both the AAAS and ESA are providing logistical support to promote these programs by distributing in formation and hosting opportunities at national meetings for the prospective applicants to learn more about research opportunities in national parks. These activities will certainly help meet the goal of attracting new people to consider working in national parks but with out support from funding sources the primary goal of both these programs and the NR Challenge will not be met. Fantastic as the Canon Scholars and NPER fellows programs are in providing opportunities for ecological research in national parks by themselves they are too small to achieve a marked increased in research activities in national parks in the near future. The Canon Scholars program currently has expanded its scope to include research in national parks in all of the Americas which is a valuable addition to the scope of the program. But as a consequence only four scholars per year will now be funded to work in U.S. National Parks and biology (broadly defined) is only one of the four areas supported. Similarly the NPER program is likely only to fund 2 3 fellows per year for the next 3 4 years. Consequently the combined   intellectual yield   from these programs of young scientists pursuing eco logical research in U.S. National Parks in the near future is likely to be small. Both these programs rely on private funds and their potential for growth is dependent on either the increased generosity from current funders or identifying additional sources of private funds. Is this the only way to promote ecological research in our national parks? Shouldnt it be feasible for federal programs that fund ecological research particularly at the pre and post doctoral level to promote research opportunities in national parks? For example what prevents the National Science Foundation (NSF) Dissertation Improvement Grants and postdoctoral fellowships in BioInformatics and Microbial Biology programs from including mention that our national parks (and other federal lands) provide unique opportunities for research? Similarly collaboration and cooperation with private foundations that support research in conservation biology should be encouraged. A potentially important collaboration that could be facilitated by members of the ESA is with the David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship Program.6 Established by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in 1998 the Smith Fellows program funds 5 7 fellows each year to con duct applied research in biological conservation in the United States. TNCs   Conservation by Design   pro gram explicitly focuses on the need to develop conservation tools that can be applied at scales great enough to impact the viability of species communities and ecosystems. Wouldnt our national parks be ideal laboratories for such research? While no preference need be given to applications to the NSF or Smith Fellows programs that use national parks and their re sources (though this might be something to consider in the future) simply identifying national parks as potential sites for research might go a long way in promoting   parks for science   and bring both good science and good (young) scientists to the parks. The inventory and monitoring data on biological cultural and physical features of the national parks that are being expanded and made available on the web under the NR Challenge program could provide a fantastic resource for research questions that require consideration of how patterns vary across spatial scales. Our national parks provide a living legacy of the natural resources and biological features of this country. Research to promote better understanding of how to preserve protect and manage these lands and to take advantage of the living laboratories that they provide should be promoted at all levels. The ESA is taking a small role in this by being involved in the NPER Fellowship Program but opportunities may exist for us as a Society and certainly as individuals to do more to promote ecological research in our national parks. This should include working to break down the cultural barriers that may in the past have prevented coordination of efforts among agencies and private and public organizations to support ecological research in national parks. At the very least we should encourage students to pursue these opportunities and facilitate their efforts to work in national parks. What we do now will certainly pay off in the future. 504:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There are perhaps few broader or more important stages for the application of ecological science than recovery planning for threatened and endangered species. The Endangered Species Act requires that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service produce a recovery plan for all listed species unless it can be argued that doing so will not help conservation efforts on behalf of that species. Essentially whenever species get in trouble in the United States biologists attempt to describe their status the threats to their persistence a strategy for bringing the species back from the brink and criteria that can be used to decide whether we have succeeded. The recovery plans that assemble and synthesize all of this information are not legally binding but they capture our thinking about what is needed to save species at risk. The topics raised in recovery plans range from the genetic details of population structure to species interactions maintaining ecosystem functions monitoring and evaluation and adaptive management. If the science of ecology is not helping us recover species then we have to wonder about the potential for applying our science to real world problems. This Invited Feature summarizes the results of a large national study of recovery plans involving 18 universities with funding from the Society for Conservation Biology the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Recovery plans for 181 species were examined in detail. The purpose was to identify aspects of recovery plans that might be improved with respect to the application of science to problems of species conservation. The process of conducting the study entailed a healthy tension between the practicality and limited resources of those who know what recovery planning means in the field and those in academia who champion textbook ideas of how ecological and population theory should be mustered to save species. The papers speak for themselves. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis website on recovery makes additional information available to the public for examination and downloading and is an important database which quantitatively summarizes attributes of a large sample of recovery plans. These data may allow us to identify associations between on the ground recovery success and particular aspects of recovery planning. Currently it is clear that we know too little about how we can make the application of ecological science more useful in producing meaningful policy results. It is certain that simply publishing papers in journals is not enough. This Invited Feature grew out of a commitment by the USFWS to scrutinize its efforts in recovery planning and learn where it could do better. It is unusual for government agencies which are overwhelmed with day to day management crises to take the time for reflection. I believe the USFWS should be applauded for encouraging this project. The last paper in this feature represents the USFWSs reaction to the study and includes several concrete ideas for improving the recovery process. One especially notable point made by the USFWS is that they need more help and participation from academic researchers. Unfortunately the fraction of academic ecologists willing to sign up and help with recovery planning is miniscule. Maybe this Invited Feature can help change that remoteness.  507:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As agency biologists with snore than 30 years of collective recovery experience we provide our perspective on the endangered species recovery planning process and the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) recovery planning study. As part of the continuum from listing through recovery planning and implementation to species recovery and delisting we believe that clearly written well designed recovery plans can play a key role in organizing and focusing the recovery effort for endangered and threatened species. We outline major opportunities constraints and limitations of the recovery planning process. Next we discuss some of the major results and recommendations of the SCB recovery plan study and identify 10 action items for further U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service consideration as possible ways to strengthen our recovery program for endangered and threatened species. 514:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coordinating management among multiple landowners and jurisdictional agencies is one of the greatest challenges confronting conservation planning. In this study we assessed the impacts on recovery progress of the people and property involved in recovery plan development and implementation. We compared indices of recovery progress among endangered species whose primary habitat falls into one of four federal jurisdiction categories: nonfederal land only  50 PeRcEnT federal land  50 PeRcEnT but not all federal land and all federal land. Species found exclusively on federal land are more likely to be improving in status. This may result from the fact that overall implementation of recovery tasks is lower among species occurring exclusively on nonfederal lands. Revision status the existence of a centralized database the designation of a person or committee to coordinate plan implementation the parties involved in drafting the plan and those designated as responsible for implementing recovery tasks are also significant factors in determining recovery plan implementation. Specifically diversity of recovery team membership and the average number of participants increase with increasing federal jurisdiction and tasks are more likely to be completed when more parties are involved in developing recovery plans. However fewer recovery tasks are completed as the number of parties involved in implementation increases suggesting that species on federal lands may benefit from less division of labor among agencies. Differences in drafting plans and administering their implementation appear to be stronger determinants of the observed variation in recovery success than differences in the kinds of threats facing species and their habitats. 517:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,521:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Endangered Species Act recovery plans have come under increased scrutiny in both political and academic arenas as species are continually added to the endangered species list but few are removed. To promote more effective recovery planning the Society for Conservation Biology in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis sponsored a collaborative project among 19 universities to systematically review a large representative sample of recovery plans. The primary goals of the project were to gather data about the content and characteristics of each sampled recovery plan; to analyze these data to identify important differences patterns and trends among the population of plan; and to use these results to inform recommendations for how the recovery planning process could be improved. We developed and used a detailed data collection Instrument to consider and characterize specific attributes of each sampled recovery plan. Topics covered by the Instrument included descriptive attributes of the plan and subject species information about species biology threats to species prescribed management actions monitoring protocols plan administration public relations and the criteria against which recovery was measured. Using a standardized data collection Instrument helped to ensure that data collection was systematic and consistent. Data were compiled into a single large database that could then be queried for quantitative statistical analyses. We describe the methods used to sample recovery plans develop the Instrument calibrate data collection and conduct recovery plan reviews. Finally we note potential benefits and limitations of this collaborative project. 531:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In 1988 the Endangered Species Act was amended to require that recovery plans include objective criteria for delisting. In this paper we characterized (1) temporal trends in the use of recovery criteria; (2) patterns of use for different categories of recovery criteria; (3) variability in the use of criteria by taxa and plan type; and (4) the relationship between categories of recovery criteria (population size population trend habitat fragmentation demography and legal policy other) and population status  declining stable improving). Of the 181 species (in 135 recovery plans) analyzed 91 PeRcEnT include at least one criterion and 81 PeRcEnT include at least one quantitative criterion. The total number of recovery criteria specified in plans increased significantly for species with plans approved after 1990. However the number of recovery criteria characterized as having an unclear relationship to biological information also increased significantly for plans approved after 1990. Population size was the most quantitative and frequently used criterion and there was a significant increase in the number of   population size   and   population trend   criteria with quantitative metrics after 1990. Species characterized as improving were more likely to include a very clear relationship to biological information. More recovery criteria are being developed for species in recent plans and there is some evidence that species with improving status have a larger number of recovery criteria. 534:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,541:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine reserves are being established worldwide in response to a growing recognition of the conservation crisis that is building in the oceans. However designation of reserves has been largely opportunistic or protective measures have been implemented (often overlapping and sometimes in conflict) by different entities seeking to achieve different ends. This has created confusion among both users and enforcers and the proliferation of different measures provides a false sense of protection where little is offered. This paper sets out a procedure grounded in current understanding of ecological processes that allows the evaluation and selection of reserve sites in order to develop functional interconnected networks of fully protected reserves that will fulfill multiple objectives. By fully protected we mean permanently closed to fishing and other resource extraction. We provide a framework that unifies the central aims of conservation and fishery management while also meeting other human needs such. as the provision of ecosystem services  maintenance of coastal water quality shoreline protection and recreational opportunities). In our scheme candidate sites for reserves are evaluated against 12 criteria focused toward sustaining the biological integrity and productivity of marine systems at both local and regional scales. While a limited number of sites will be indispensable in a network many will be of similar value as reserves allowing the design of numerous alternative biologically adequate networks. Devising multiple network designs will help ensure that ecological functionality is preserved throughout the socioeconomic evaluation process. Too often socioeconomic criteria have dominated the process of reserve selection potentially undermining their efficacy. We argue that application of biological criteria must precede and inform socioeconomic evaluation since maintenance of ecosystem functioning is essential for meeting all of the goals for reserves. It is critical that stakeholders are fully involved throughout this process. Application of the proposed criteria will lead to networks whose multifunctionality will help. unite the objectives of different management entities so accelerating progress toward improved stewardship of the oceans. 551:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recovery efforts for threatened and endangered species often must be initiated with incomplete data. The outcomes of such efforts are difficult to predict which makes monitoring the progress of recovery efforts an integral part of the recovery process. We evaluated the role of monitoring in recovery plans for 181 species listed as threatened and endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We considered both the extent to which monitoring tasks were proposed as part of the recovery effort and the extent to which the tasks proposed were actually implemented. In general tasks devoted to tracking the species population trend were more likely to be proposed and implemented than were other monitoring activities  those devoted to the species demographic its habitat requirements or the impact of predators competitors and exotics). We found that the extent and nature of the monitoring proposed and implemented appeared to reflect taxonomic biases that exist throughout the recovery process and were little influenced either by the level of understanding of the species biology or by the recovery priority assigned to the species. In particular monitoring efforts did not adequately address the specific threats affecting species. Proposals for and implementation of monitoring progress toward recovery goals were independent of the type of criteria defined in the plans  population level and habitat extent) although population related criteria were disproportionately common. Based on these findings we caution against an overemphasis on focal species monitoring especially when such an emphasis leads to the reduction or exclusion of other types of monitoring. We also recommend that species specific attributes factor more prominently in the development of monitoring to avoid monitoring action that is otherwise unnecessary. 552:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recovery plans for endangered and threatened species will not benefit conservation efforts unless prescribed tasks are actually implemented. We analyzed data collected on task implementation in early 1999 and found that an average of 70.3 PeRcEnT of recovery tasks were either partially or completely implemented although they ranged from 0 PeRcEnT to 100 PeRcEnT implemented. Plans approved in 1990 or earlier had relatively uniform task implementation whereas implementation of more recent plans varied with plan and species attributes. Among plans approved after 1990 mufti species plans had lower task implementation than single species plans. Recovery plans for plants terrestrial species and insular species had a lower degree of task implemention than those for animals aquatic species and continental species respectively. Analyses further indicated that species with: (1) critical habitat designation (2) conflict designation (3) revised recovery plans (4) a recovery coordinator and (5) a dedicated database had greater task implementation than species lacking these management features. These results suggest that mufti species plans are implemented snore slowly than single species plans and that recovery plans for species with greater public or agency profiles (as evidenced by critical habitat designation conflict designation and plan revision) are implemented at a higher rate. The effect of administrative strategies on higher rates of task implementation indicate that recovery efforts should include a recovery coordinator and database whenever possible. When developing recovery plans responsible agencies should explicitly consider attributes of species and plans that influence task implementation. 553:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Revisions allow the recovery planning process for threatened and endangered species to be flexible and responsive to new information or changes in the status of a species. However the Endangered Species Act defines neither firm criteria that trigger revision of recovery plans nor clear guidelines about how plans should be revised. Consequently the effect of revisions in the recovery planning process is unknown. We examined how species and recovery plan attributes influenced the likelihood that a plan would be revised and how the content of plans changed with revision. Vertebrate species with designated critical habitat were nearly four times more likely to have their recovery plans revised than were invertebrates or plants without designated critical habitat. Nonetheless recovery priorities assigned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) did not influence the likelihood of plan revision. Paired comparisons between original and revised versions suggested that knowledge of species biology and status had improved and that recognition of threats had increased since the original plans were written. However these improvements did not lead to recovery criteria or monitoring actions that were more clearly justified. We recommend that recovery plan authors strive to maximize benefits from improved biological information by defining management actions and goals that are more biologically justified. We also urge the USFWS to establish a consistent priority system for recovery plan revisions that affords consideration to listed species of all taxa and emphasizes revisions for those species most likely to benefit. 554:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Several schemes have been developed to help select the locations of marine reserves. All of them combine social economic and biological criteria and few offer any guidance as to how to prioritize among the criteria identified. This can imply that the relative weights given to different criteria are unimportant. Where two sites are of equal value ecologically; then socioeconomic criteria should dominate the choice of which should be protected. However in many cases socioeconomic criteria are given equal or greater weight than ecological considerations in the choice of sites. This can lead to selection of reserves with little biological value that fail to meet many of the desired objectives. To avoid such a possibility we develop a series of criteria that allow preliminary evaluation of candidate sites according to their relative biological values in advance of the application of socioeconomic criteria. We include criteria that . while not strictly biological have a strong influence on the species present or ecological processes. Out scheme enables sites to be assessed according to their biodiversity the processes which underpin that diversity and the processes that support fisheries and provide a spectrum of other services important to people. Criteria that capture biodiversity values include biogeographic representation habitat representation and heterogeneity and presence of species or populations of special interest  threatened species). Criteria that capture sustainability of biodiversity and fishery values include the size of reserves necessary to protect viable habitats presence of exploitable species vulnerable life stages connectivity among reserves links among ecosystems and provision of ecosystem services to people. Criteria measuring human and natural threats enable candidate sites to be eliminated from consideration if risks are too great but also help prioritize among sites where threats can be mitigated by protection. While our criteria can be applied to the design of reserve networks they also enable choice of single reserves to be made in the context of the attributes of existing protected areas. The overall goal of our scheme is to promote the development of reserve networks that will maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning at large scales. The values of eco system goods and services for people ultimately depend on meeting this objective. 555:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,559:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The recovery of threatened and endangered species is complicated by the number severity and tractability of the threats facing each species. We investigated the nature and the treatment of threats in recovery plans for 181 threatened and endangered species. We examined the types of threats facing species as well as the degree to which threats were understood and addressed. We found that  85 PeRcEnT of all species faced at least four out of nine distinct types of threats. The most common threats were those related to resource use exotic species construction and the alteration of habitat dynamics. Recovery plans lacked basic information about the magnitude timing frequency or severity of 39 PeRcEnT of all threats facing the 181 species. Likewise 37 PeRcEnT of all threats were not directly addressed with recovery tasks. Threats from pollution were more poorly understood than other threats and threats from exotics were better addressed than other types of threats. Finally we found that threats that were better understood were assigned recovery tasks more often than threats that were more poorly understood. Thus our results suggest that a lack of basic understanding of the nature of the threats facing threatened and endangered species may in part be undermining our recovery efforts. 560:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The species area relationship (SPAR) was the central paradigm for the emerging science of reserve design in the 1970s and early 1980s. The apparent consistency of the SPAR for natural areas suggested that it could be used to predict the number of species that would be maintained within the isolated confines of a nature reserve. This proposed use of the SPAR led to heated debates about how best to partition space among reserves. However by the end of the 1990s the SPAR was no longer a central issue in. reserve design. There was too much uncertainty about the underlying causes of the SPAR to trust that it would hold for reserves. The SPAR was also inappropriate for the design of single species reserves and thus did not answer the traditional needs of wildlife managers. Ecologists subsequently focused their reserve design efforts on the management of individual populations to reduce the probability of extinction and the loss of genetic variation. Nevertheless because the SPAR does not require detailed knowledge of the requirements of individual species it is still used to estimate local species richness and to predict the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity. These applications of the SPAR may be especially useful in the design of marine reserves which often differ in purpose from conventional terrestrial reserves and may require fundamentally different approaches. 563:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) generally requires that critical habitat be designated for all species listed as endangered or threatened. However it has been designated for only similar to10 PeRcEnT of listed species. Recently in response to several recent court orders and settlement agreements that require critical habitat to be designated for similar to300 species the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided to divert all available budget resources for 2001 to address the backlog of designations. This decision underscores a central question in the controversies surrounding critical habitat designation: How does critical habitat benefit the conservation and eventual recovery of listed species? Here we examined how designation of critical habitat influenced the recovery planning process by comparing the content and characteristics of recovery plans for species with and without designated critical habitat. Critical habitat designation did not increase the availability of information on species habitat requirements or increase the likelihood that recovery plans prescribed habitat management or habitat acquisition among the necessary recovery tasks. Recovery plans for species with critical habitat were not more likely to include habitat considerations among criteria for measuring recovery. Recovery plans for species with critical habitat uniformly ranked habitat concerns among the top threats to species and on average proposed a greater diversity of habitat monitoring efforts. Overall however we concluded that critical habitat designations have had negligible positive influence in the recovery planning process. We discuss possible explanations and suggest a standards based system for designating critical habitat that should promote more effective contributions to recovery efforts for threatened and endangered species. 564:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is relying increasingly on a mufti species rather than the more traditional single species approach to recovery planning under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Supporters of the mufti species approach note potential efficiency gains in terms of biodiversity protection and agency resources. By the end of 1998  55 PeRcEnT of all ESA listed species with recovery plans were covered within multi species plans. A recent analysis found that species within mufti species plans are significantly more likely to exhibit a declining status trend. Given this finding we compared single to mufti species plans and found that mufti species plans reflect a poorer understanding of species specific biology are less likely to include adaptive management provisions and are revised less frequently. USFWS guidelines recommend that species be combined into mufti species plans primarily on the basis of threat similarity. We developed a threat similarity index to evaluate the USFWSs conformance with these guidelines. Nearly half of the mufti species plans failed to display threat similarity greater than that for randomly selected groups of species. We advocate the explicit use of threat similarity analyses to identify appropriate groups of species for concurrent management thereby maximizing benefits and minimizing potential drawbacks of a mufti species approach. We conclude that as currently employed by the USFWS mufti species recovery plans are less effective management tools than single species plans. Given the increasing number of species covered by mufti species plans and the problems identified with these plans we recommend that the USFWS reevaluate its use of the mufti species approach to recovery planning. 571:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Using benthic habitat data from the Florida Keys (USA) we demonstrate how siting algorithms can help identify potential networks of marine reserves that comprehensively represent target habitat types. We applied a flexible optimization tool simulated annealing to represent a fixed proportion of different marine habitat types within a geographic area. We investigated the relative influence of spatial information planning unit size detail of habitat classification and magnitude of the overall conservation goal on the resulting network scenarios. With this method we were able to identify many adequate reserve systems that met the conservation goals representing at least 20 PeRcEnT of each conservation target  habitat type) while fulfilling the overall aim of minimizing the system area and perimeter. One of the most useful types of information provided by this siting algorithm comes from an   irreplaceability analysis    which is a count of the number of times unique planning units were included in reserve system scenarios. This analysis indicated that many different combinations of sites produced networks that met the conservation goals. While individual 1 km(2) areas were fairly interchangeable the irreplaceability analysis highlighted larger areas within the planning region that were chosen consistently to meet the goals incorporated into the algorithm. Additionally we found that reserve systems designed with a high degree of spatial clustering tended to have considerably less perimeter and larger overall areas in reserve a configuration that may be preferable particularly for sociopolitical reasons. This exercise illustrates the value of using the simulated annealing algorithm to help site marine reserves: the approach makes efficient use of;available resources can be used interactively by conservation decision makers and offers biologically suitable alternative networks from which an effective system of marine reserves can be crafted. 572:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Using ecological criteria as a theoretical framework we describe the steps involved in designing a network of marine reserves for conservation and fisheries management. Although we describe the case study of the Channel Islands the approach to marine reserve design may be effective in other regions where traditional management alone does not sustain marine resources. A group of agencies organizations and individuals established clear goals for marine reserves in the Channel Islands including conservation of ecosystem biodiversity sustainable fisheries economic viability natural and cultural heritage and education. Given the constraints of risk management experimental design monitoring and enforcement scientists recommended at least one but no more than four reserves in each biogeographic region. In general the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands after consideration of both conservation goals and the risk from human threats and natural catastrophes scientists recommended reserving an area of 30 50 PeRcEnT of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. For most species of concern except pinnipeds and seabirds information about distributions dispersal and population growth was limited. As an alternative to species distribution information suitable habitats for species of concern were used to locate potential reserve sites. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify potential reserve network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible. The analysis produced an array of potential reserve network scenarios that all met the established goals. 573:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Using the results of a survey of recovery plans for threatened and endangered species we evaluated the role that Population Viability Analysis (PVA) has played in recovery planning and management of rare species in the United States. Although there was a significant increase over time in the percentage of plans presenting information on PVA and assigning recovery tasks to collect more such information the use of PVA was still called for in less than half of the plans approved since 1991. Because scarcity of data for rare species may be limiting the application of PVA to endangered species we also assessed how often recovery plans proposed to collect the full complement of data required to perform four general types of PVA. For most of the species in the database proposed monitoring data would allow the simplest type of PVA method  analysis of total population counts) to be applied but more complex PVAs would be possible for  25 PeRcEnT of the species. We conclude with brief recommendations for how the use of PVA in endangered species recovery planning might be improved in the future. 574:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We asked two basic questions about endangered species recovery plans: (1) Have recovery plans improved over the last decade? (2) Are important features of recovery plans biased toward plants or animals? We answer these questions in the context of a large national study aimed at statistically summarizing key features of recovery plans and how those plans use science. In addition we asked if the status of endangered species tends to be improving. Overall the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is improving in its use of science in recovery plans. For example based on the increased number of monitoring tasks included in more recent plans the USFWS is becoming more concerned with the need to monitor changes in endangered species populations and their habitats. Similarly specific recovery criteria such as the number of years that a species needs to maintain a target population size are more often being included in recovery plans. However several features of recovery plans have not shown improvement such as the tasks recommended to address major threats and the limited influence of focal species biology on the selection of recovery criteria and monitoring protocols. Recovery plan features tend to be biased toward animals in several ways. Among animals more tasks are recommended to address limitations in current biological information to address major threats to the species and to enhance public relations than is the case for plants. Finally similar to30 PeRcEnT of species for which the current recovery plan is older than 1990 are increasing in abundance a marked improvement over those species for which the recovery plan was only recently written. These data suggest that the process of listing species and writing recovery plans is working. In addition animal populations are more often increasing in abundance than plant populations. 575:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We assessed the internal consistency of the planning process for endangered species by analyzing over 150 recovery plans. We evaluated consistency within recovery plans in three key areas: threats to species gaps in information and monitoring of species recovery. Our analyses revealed that recovery plans typically have high levels of internal consistency in all key areas with mean consistency  50 PeRcEnT for eight of the nine comparisons conducted. The only area with relatively low consistency was monitoring. Specifically we found low consistency in monitoring threats (25.7 1.76 PeRcEnT mean 1 SE) and monitoring of recovery criteria (consistency 51.3 3.35 PeRcEnT). In general multi species plans were more consistent than single species plans in monitoring identified threats. Our results suggest that recovery plans are effectively maintaining a consistent focus in their recommendations for endangered species recovery with the exception of monitoring. We emphasise however that internal consistency alone is not sufficient to assure that a recovery plan will be effective. 598:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,599:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,5:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,603:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biodiversity and ecosystem data are both geo referenced and   species referenced  . Ecoregion classification systems are relevant to basic ecological research and have been increasingly used for making policy and management decisions. There are practical needs to integrate taxonomic data with ecoregion data in a GIS to visualize and explore species distribution conveniently. In this study we represent the species distributed in an ecoregion as a taxonomic tree and extend the classic GIS data model to incorporate operations on taxonomic trees. A prototype called GBD Explorer was developed on top of the open source JUMP GIS. We use the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) terrestrial ecoregion and WildFinder species databases as an example to demonstrate the rich capabilities implemented in the prototype. 604:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological databases continue to grow in volume breadth and complexity. Higher level descriptions of data  metadata) and information derived from subsequent data processing and analyses    meta information   in the broadest sense) are essential for understanding and using the increasingly complex and voluminous data and information. The concepts of meta information in general and metadata in particular have evolved in concert with the increasing needs for functionality by the community. From a scientific perspective metadata may be characterized as having developed from initially supporting data discovery; to facilitating acquisition comprehension and utilization of data by humans; and most recently to beginning to enable automated data discovery ingestion processing and analysis via metadata enabled scientific workflow systems. The continued conceptual and operational developments in metadata required to support comprehensive automated scientific workflow systems portend many challenges and opportunities. For example there are significant opportunities for collaboration among ecologists and computer scientists in developing domain specific controlled vocabularies and ontologies that provide the basis for semantic mediation the   glue   technologies that enable automated data discovery ingestion processing and analysis. Similarly there are opportunities for computer scientists and engineers to develop new mechanisms that support automated metadata encoding such as providing the information that would be necessary to understand the end to end flow of sensor data from in situ data collection streaming through quality assurance filtering aggregation transformation and additional processing analysis and publication of digital products. As the technologies mature we still have many sociological barriers to overcome including the needs for increased attention to software usability testing and engineering to enhance user friendliness of metadata management software new capital investments in ecological data archives and increasing the metadata management benefit cost ratio for the average scientist via incentives and enabling tools. 611:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The field of ecological informatics addresses challenges in the representation management analysis and modeling of ecological data and information (Michener 2006; Jones . 2006). Research advances in informatics continue to be critical to the improvement of cyberinfrastructure capabilities and techniques available to ecological researchers. Over the last several years researchers in informatics have been creating and adopting novel approaches to the management of ecological data including techniques from the rapidly advancing fields of knowledge representation and scientific workflow systems. Traditional approaches to managing ecological data have often produced project specific software solutions that are useful in the limited context of a particular research project. Advances in broadly applicable cyberinfrastructure promise to tremendously improve the capabilities of ecological and environmental scientists. In this special feature we highlight eight novel papers that have shown how informatics and computer science have contributed to advancing ecological science and highlight the emerging frontiers at the intersection of meta information systems and ontologies. These papers were selected from submissions that were presented at the 2006 meeting of the International Society for Ecological Informatics which was held in Santa Barbara CA. The papers are divided into three themes: metadata ontologies and data management; representing and visualizing taxonomies; and scientific workflows provenance and data analysis. 612:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,634:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,637:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,650:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,661:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,673:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,675:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,72:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,774:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The value of meta analysis in ecology hinges on the reproducibility of patterns generated by quantitative synthesis. Meta analysts will vary in the criteria they use to screen studies and select data within studies even when addressing exactly the same question. We summarize some of the many decisions that an ecologist must make in deciding what data to include in a synthesis. We then show using multiple meta analyses taken from the same literature on stream predation experiments that meta analytic conclusions can be colored by selection criteria that are not specifically a function of the relevance of the data. As a consequence we recommend that meta analysts perform several meta analyses using different selection criteria to examine the robustness of reported findings. We also advise ecological meta analysts to minimize use of selection criteria that are based on judgments of study quality when extracting data from the literature because of the potential for unconscious bias. The influence of quality criteria on patterns in the data set can then be examined empirically. Our comparisons of mean effect size for studies included vs. excluded on the basis of   quality   criteria provided no evidence that rejected studies were aberrant or more variable than   acceptable   studies. One result of excluding such studies was a loss of statistical power. We urge ecologists to be more explicit about how data are selected for a meta analysis to examine the robustness of the patterns they report and to conduct meta analyses to describe as well as to infer. 78:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,805:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Systematic planning for biodiversity conservation is being conducted at scales ranging from global to national to regional. The prevailing planning paradigm is to identify the minimum land allocations needed to reach specified conservation targets or maximize the amount of conservation accomplished under an area or budget constraint. We propose a more general formulation for setting conservation priorities that involves goal setting assessing the current conservation system developing a scenario of future biodiversity given the current conservation system and allocating available conservation funds to alter that scenario so as to maximize future biodiversity. Under this new formulation for setting conservation priorities the value of a site depends on resource quality threats to resource quality and costs. This planning approach is designed to support collaborative processes and negotiation among competing interest groups. We demonstrate these ideas with a case study of the Sierra Nevada bioregion of California. 826:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Creating networks of nature reserves to protect areas rich in biodiversity from the adverse impacts of anthropogenic change is a critical and urgent task. We illustrate the skewed geographical and size distributions of protected areas in the Western Hemisphere. For instance 811 of 1413 reserves in the Western Hemisphere are smaller than 10 km(2) and 35 PeRcEnT of the total area of these reserves is in Alaska. We compile ranges for all bats in the continental Western Hemisphere and find that 82 PeRcEnT of threatened and small range species are not protected adequately. Many of the most vulnerable species occur in the areas of highest human density. We provide maps delineating areas where conservation investments may have the greatest impact in preventing biodiversity losses. 82:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,83:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,846:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Loss of biodiversity is one of the worlds overriding environmental challenges. Reducing those losses by creating reserve networks is a cornerstone of global conservation and resource management. Historically assembly of reserve networks has been ad hoc but recently the focus has shifted to identifying optimal reserve networks. We show that while comprehensive reserve network design is best when the entire network can be implemented immediately when conservation investments must be staged over years such solutions actually may be sub optimal in the context of biodiversity loss and uncertainty. Simple decision rules such as protecting the available site with the highest irreplaceability or with the highest species richness may be more effective when implementation occurs over many years. 860:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P Expert knowledge in ecology is gaining momentum as a tool for conservation decision making where data are lacking. Yet little information is available to help a researcher decide whether expert opinion is useful for their model how an elicitation should be conducted what the most relevant method for elicitation is and how this can be translated into prior distributions for analysis in a Bayesian model. In this study we provide guidance in using expert knowledge in a transparent and credible manner to inform ecological models and ultimately natural resource and conservation decision making. We illustrate the decisions faced when considering the use of expert knowledge in a model with the help of two real ecological case studies. These examples are explored further to examine the impact of expert knowledge through priors in Bayesian modeling and specifically how to minimize potential bias. Finally we make recommendations on the use of expert opinion in ecology. We believe if expert knowledge is elicited and incorporated into ecological models with the same level of rigour provided in the collection and use of empirical data expert knowledge can increase the precision of models and facilitate informed decision making in a cost effective manner. 878:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Risk ranking protocols are used widely to classify the conservation status of the worlds species. Here we report on the first empirical assessment of their reliability by using a retrospective study of 18 pairs of bird and mammal species (one species extinct and the other extant) with eight different assessors. The performance of individual assessors varied substantially but performance was improved by incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimates and consensus among the assessors. When this was done the ranks from the protocols were consistent with the extinction outcome in 70 80 PeRcEnT of pairs and there were mismatches in only 10 20 PeRcEnT of cases. This performance was similar to the subjective judgements of the assessors after they had estimated the range and population parameters required by the protocols and better than any single parameter. When used to inform subjective judgement the protocols therefore offer a means of reducing unpredictable biases that may be associated with expert input and have the advantage of making the logic behind assessments explicit. We conclude that the protocols are useful for forecasting extinctions although they are prone to some errors that have implications for conservation. Some level of error is to be expected however given the influence of chance on extinction. The performance of risk assessment protocols may be improved by providing training in the application of the protocols incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimates and using consensus among multiple assessors including some who are experts in the application of the protocols. Continued testing and refinement of the protocols may help to provide better absolute estimates of risk particularly by re evaluating how the protocols accommodate missing data. 94:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,967:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As natural resource management agencies and conservation organizations seek guidance on responding to climate change myriad potential actions and strategies have been proposed for increasing the long term viability of some attributes of natural systems. Managers need practical tools for selecting among these actions and strategies to develop a tailored management approach for specific targets at a given location. We developed and present one such tool the participatory Adaptation for Conservation Targets (ACT) framework which considers the effects of climate change in the development of management actions for particular species ecosystems and ecological functions. Our framework is based on the premise that effective adaptation of management to climate change can rely on local knowledge of an ecosystem and does not necessarily require detailed projections of climate change or its effects. We illustrate the ACT framework by applying it to an ecological function in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Montana Wyoming and Idaho USA) water flows in the upper Yellowstone River. We suggest that the ACT framework is a practical tool for initiating adaptation planning and for generating and communicating specific management interventions given an increasingly altered yet uncertain climate. 975:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is sponsoring development of ecological soil screening levels (Eco SSLs) for terrestrial wildlife. These are intended to be used to identify chemicals of potential ecological concern at Superfund sites. Ecological soil screening levels represent concentrations of contaminants in soils that are believed to be protective of ecological receptors. An exposure model based on soil and food ingestion rates and the relationship between the concentrations of contaminants in soil and food has been developed for estimation of wildlife Eco SSLs. It is important to understand how conservative and protective these values are how parameterization of the model influences the resulting Eco SSL and how the treatment of uncertainty impacts results. The Eco SSLs were calculated for meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and northern short tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) for lead and DDT using deterministic and probabilistic methods. Conclusions obtained include that use of central tendency point estimates may result in hazard quotients much larger than one; that a Monte Carlo approach also leads to hazard quotients that can be substantially larger than one; that if no hazard quotients larger than one are allowed any probabilistic approach is identical to a worst case approach; and that an improvement in the quality and amount of data is necessary to increase confidence that Eco SSLs are protective at their intended levels of conservatism. 98:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,9:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,9:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We study the problem of answering queries over sources with limited access patterns. The problem is to decide whether a given query Q is feasible equivalent to an executable query Q that observes the limited access patterns given by the sources. We characterize the complexity of deciding feasibility for the classes CQ( ) (conjunctive queries with negation) and UCQ( ) (unions of CQ( ) queries): Testing feasibility is just as hard as testing containment and therefore Pi(2)(P) complete. We also provide a uniform treatment for CQ UCQ CQ( ) and UCQ( ) by devising a single algorithm which is optimal for each of these classes. In addition we show how one can often avoid the worst case complexity by certain approximations: At compile time even if a query Q is not feasible we can find efficiently the minimal executable query containing Q. For query answering at runtime we devise an algorithm which may report complete answers even in the case of infeasible plans and which can indicate to the user the degree of completeness for certain incomplete answers. 1025:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, evaluating the ecological effectiveness of the hundreds of millions of dollars invested to recover Pacific Northwest salmon has a number of prerequisites principally detailed knowledge of management actions. In the absence of coordinated ecological monitoring basic restoration project metadata (type location timing etc.) is the primary source of information guiding restoration planning and management decisions. There are surprisingly few sources of habitat restoration information at scales appropriate to salmon recovery ranging from small sub watersheds to multistate evolutionarily significant units. We evaluate the consistency of two Columbia River basin restoration inventories developed in different ways but similar in goal: to inform future project placement. We compared the Pacific Northwest Habitat Project Database compiled by researchers at NOAA Fisheries Service and the Subbasin Inventories compiled by local entities within each of 62 subbasins. Confederating these two data holdings we found 11 805 projects in the Columbia River Basin with only 13 PeRcEnT (1 549 11 805) in common. Subbasin scale inventories capture more locally sponsored projects than do large scale data compilations. Attributes (date cost) of projects in common to both datasets matched less than half the time suggesting organizations working on the same project are reporting independently and differently to either the database or inventories. We found that the lack of common data standards and lack of knowledge about accessible data sources are major hurdles to making data available for decision making. 1043:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Advertisements for faculty positions increasingly require or imply a strong preference for candidates who have held one or more postdoctoral positions. Unfortunately the number of available postdoctoral fellowships is not keeping up with the yearly increase in the number of graduating PhD students. As a result more and more postdoc positions in ecology are creatively defined softmoney positions often requiring some level of self funding. The lack of standard application methods guidelines or support can be worrying for students trying to squeeze a job search in between writing dissertation chapters. Here we describe the experiences of three recent PhD graduates in preparing for applying to and obtaining postdoctoral positions. We emphasize the preparation and persistence needed to reach this increasingly important rung on the ecological career ladder. When do I begin the search process? Our own experiences and those of our peers suggest that PhD students who began thinking about their future goals well before their final year in graduate school were the most successful in obtaining quality postdocs. They shared their goals with their dissertation committees as a way of crosschecking expectations and developing a realistic timeline for degree completion. Stories of students who graduated with no job waiting for them are all too common. Less common but perhaps equally frightening are the tales of students who started jobs before completing their degrees and ended up with terminal AbDs (All but Dissertation). An early inventory of career and personal goals leads to success in graduate school which provides the foundation for a successful postdoc search. What types of opportunities are out there? Ecological postdoctoral positions can range from teaching at a small liberal arts school to conducting research at a large university to working for a government institution. The process of applying for each of these varies greatly. In general we have found that the complexity of theapplication process is positively correlated with the degree of autonomy a postdoc will experience on the job. With advertised positions principal investigators expect their postdocs to work on the project funding the position whereas fellowship and institutional positions that require a proposal as part of the application process offer the postdoc greater independence. Due to the burgeoning pool of applicants and the dearth of available positions many students find they must create a position for themselves which can offer even greater flexibility but demands considerable forethought and planning. How does one create a postdoc position? One of us (KH) began the process of creating a postdoc position 14 months prior to her expected graduation date. She began by researching the past and current work of potential postdoc mentors with whom she was interested in working including the work of their current students and postdocs. Initially she sent each potential mentor a personalized email with new research ideas and explained how she thought her ideas would fit into their labs research mission. She also inquired about funding opportunities and offered to investigate opportunities to write proposals with them for new funds. She maintained continuous communication with potential mentors throughout the final year of her PhD to nurture these budding relationships and was rewarded for her efforts when one grew into a successful postdoc collaboration. The process itself was also extremely valuable as it allowed KH to meet and discuss her research with several prominent ecologists. How do I make the most of professional relationships? As with any job search it is often not what you know but who you know that really matters. The importance of personal relationships cannot be overemphasized. In this regard the dissertation committee can be a students greatest asset. Two of us found postdoc positions directly through a committee member and all of us relied on committee members for letters of reference. Interacting with committee members outside of official meetings as well as taking a class or seminar with each member are great ways to strengthen these relationships which will in turn improve committee member reference letters. Then when applying for jobs references should be carefully matched to the position announcement. Social branches that extend beyond the committee are another effective means of fostering future postdoc opportunities. Employers frequently interview candidates recommended by someone they trust and are more likely to hire someone they already know and respect. Active participation at professional meetings can lead to greater name recognition. Meeting participation also offers an opportunity to assess the general level of interest in your research while providing exposure to new and exciting lines of inquiry. We have obtained several job leads and two offers through contacts made at annual meetings. What about the CV? The curriculum vitae (CV) is the one element common to all postdoc applications but it should be tailored for each application by highlighting activities that are especially relevant to the position. Publications are critically important; having at least one first authored publication demonstrates the ability to successfully complete the scientific process. While there may be a natural inclination to augment the publication record with a laundry list of works in prep we have learned that this strategy has the potential to backfire. Unfinished manuscripts can work against an applicant because they are not usually counted as publications and represent a detailed account of incomplete work (ie obligations that will interfere with ones postdoctoral research). Numerous resources exist to help craft an effective CV both online and through university career development programs. Finally our search for postdoc positions has taught us the importance of humility persistence and flexibility. Many more doors were shut on us than were opened and we have found the pursuit of the ideal postdoc to be unpredictable with many twists and turns. Through it all we attempted to remain prepared and open to new experiences as one opportunity has led to another. We hope we have provided useful guidance for others embarking on what should be an exciting quest. As highlighted by Hopfensperger . postdoctoral positions are becoming increasingly competitive. In 2004 the National Science Foundation recorded the number of ecology postdoctoral appointees as 170 (0.9 PeRcEnT of all biology postdocs) while the number of graduate students was 2185 (3.3 PeRcEnT of biology students; NSF 2006). Given such competition for few opportunities the benefits of early searching developing a quality CV and increased networking as suggested above will certainly include increased access to opportunities. However the concept of creatively defined soft money positions requiring some level of self funding is worrisome; graduate students ought not to feel compelled to take a less than ideal position. Equally important to recognizing your individual goals and needs as a junior scientist is to understand how these needs might be met by the postdoctoral opportunities you are evaluating. Selecting a research program that excites you a lab in which you are comfortable and one that increases your skill set are certainly valuable and are probably the most important factors to consider when choosing your host institution. However there are many different types of postdoctoral positions available and thus a clear understanding of the differences between positions and institutions will foster a more positive postdoctoral experience. A recent survey of postdoctoral scholars found that the degree of similarity between an individuals expectations and outcomes contributes to the overall level of satisfaction. Structural oversight and availability of formal training opportunities (such as seminars on proposal writing project management and teaching) accounted for much of the reported variation in satisfaction. Contented postdocs were also those who published more highlighting the potential impact of the greater institutional environment on ones research career. Yet determining what type of oversight and training is available at a host institution can be more difficult. An increasing number of US institutions serious about their research enterprises maintain either an office dedicated to postdoctoral affairs (Postdoctoral Office PDO) or a postdoctoral scholars association (PDA). These agencies provide specific information on practices within their host institution. A comprehensive database of institutional policies is also provided by the National Postdoctoral Association (NPA; www.nationalpostdoc. org). NPA graduate materials such as Finding the perfect postdoc for you Going in with your eyes open and Considerations for selecting a postdoc are valuable resources for prospective postdocs. While this additional research may seem a burden it has been suggested that the best postdoctoral experience is one in which the rules of the game are well defined and spelled out in advance. By determining up front the degree or nature of oversight at an institution the magnitude of differences between expectations and outcomes can be minimized promoting a positive and productive postdoctoral experience.  1052:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Brazilian free tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) form enormous summer breeding colonies mostly in caves and under bridges in south central Texas and northern Mexico. Their prey includes several species of adult insects whose larvae are known to be important agricultural pests including the corn earworm or cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa zea). We estimate the bats value as pest control for cotton production in an eightcounty region in south central Texas. Our calculations show an annual value of  DoLlQuAnT 741000 per year with a range of  DoLlQuAnT 121000  DoLlQuAnT 1725000 compared to a  DoLlQuAnT 4.6  DoLlQuAnT 6.4 million per year annual cotton harvest. 105:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1061:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Managing a complex ecosystem to balance delivery of all of its services is at the heart of ecosystem based management. But how can this balance be accomplished amidst the conflicting demands of stakeholders managers and policy makers? In marine ecosystems several common ecological mechanisms link biodiversity to ecosystem functioning and to a complex of essential services. As a result the effects of preserving diversity can be broadly beneficial to a wide spectrum of important ecosystem processes and services including fisheries water quality recreation and shoreline protection. A management system that conserves diversity will help to accrue more   ecoservice capital   for human use and will maintain a hedge against unanticipated ecosystem changes from natural or anthropogenic causes. Although maintenance of biodiversity cannot be the only goal for ecosystem based management it could provide a common currency for evaluating the impacts of different human activities on ecosystem functioning and can act as a critical indicator of ecosystem status. 1062:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many ecologists are interested in communicating science to the public and addressing societal concerns about environmental issues. Individual ecologists need to consider whether when and how this should be done. We propose that public outreach activities can be beneficial for ecologists at all stages of their career. There are diverse opportunities for such involvement and these can vary enormously in terms of time and expertise required. Trends within the science of ecology especially research focused on social ecological systems are likely to promote increased interactions with stakeholders and policy makers. To be effective in these interactions ecologists should consider new approaches to communication and be aware of the potential roles scientists can play in public policy debates. Professional ecologists need to engage with non scientific audiences; a review of such activities should be included in considerations for promotion recognition and awards while also acknowledging variations in the inclinations and abilities of individual scientists. There are however few current standards for how much time ecologists should commit to public outreach how time allocation might change over a career or how to evaluate the quality of such activities. We ask ecologists to consider ways to evaluate the quality of interactions with the public and how to reward these efforts appropriately. 1064:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Natural processes tend to vary over time and space as well as between species. The ecosystem services these natural processes provide are therefore also highly variable. It is often assumed that ecosystem services are provided linearly (unvaryingly at a steady rate) but natural processes are characterized by thresholds and limiting functions. In this paper we describe the variability observed in wave attenuation provided by marshes mangroves seagrasses and coral reefs and therefore also in coastal protection. We calculate the economic consequences of assuming coastal protection to be linear. We suggest that in order to refine ecosystem based management practices it is essential that natural variability and cumulative effects be considered in the valuation of ecosystem services. 1065:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nature provides a wide range of benefits to people. There is increasing consensus about the importance of incorporating these   ecosystem services   into resource management decisions but quantifying the levels and values of these services has proven difficult. We use a spatially explicit modeling tool Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) to predict changes in ecosystem services biodiversity conservation and commodity production levels. We apply InVEST to stakeholder defined scenarios of land use land cover change in the Willamette Basin Oregon. We found that scenarios that received high scores for a variety of ecosystem services also had high scores for biodiversity suggesting there is little tradeoff between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Scenarios involving more development had higher commodity production values but lower levels of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. However including payments for carbon sequestration alleviates this tradeoff. Quantifying ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner and analyzing tradeoffs between them can help to make natural resource decisions more effective efficient and defensible. 1068:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Restoration of aquatic ecosystems is a high priority regionally and globally yet only recently have such efforts adopted holistic approaches that include the restoration of streams and rivers flowing to coastal areas. As the largest estuary in the US the Chesapeake Bay has been the focus of one of the most high profile restoration programs ever undertaken in North America. While the primary emphasis has been on tidal waters freshwater tributary clean up strategies have recently been developed. We have compiled the first comprehensive database of over 4700 existing river and stream restoration projects in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) to examine where dollars are being spent what issues motivate restoration and what approaches are used. By conservative estimates in excess of  DoLlQuAnT 400 million has been invested in restoration projects since 1990. The majority of projects were implemented to restore forest vegetation in riparian areas and improve water quality. Although the CBW has an extremely high density of restoration activities relative to other regions of the US only 5.4 PeRcEnT of the project records indicated that related monitoring of project performance has occurred. To provide cost effective management solutions we recommend that a centralized tracking system be developed that includes restoration projects associated with both tidal and non tidal waterways along with a substantial increase in investment in the comprehensive monitoring of individual projects following implementation. 1071:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The role of positive interactions in structuring biological communities is recognized throughout the field of ecology but has yet to be well integrated into the restoration and conservation of aquatic systems. Here we use examples of success in terrestrial restoration to (1) describe how a broader perspective on the scale and nature of positive interactions is necessary if we are to take full advantage of their conservation potential and (2) explain why and when positive interactions should be considered in restoration and conservation of marine estuarine and freshwater habitats. Such goals can be accomplished without considering positive interactions and situations certainly exist in which positive interactions should play a minor role in restoration plans. However a more explicit recognition of these interactions will make restoration and conservation more successful. In some cases restoration activities may fail if these interactions are not included. 1075:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Two major shortcomings of the US Endangered Species Act have led to inefficient use of conservation dollars: (1) it only provides conservation protection to distressed or rapidly declining species and (2) it does not take full advantage of the market to reduce costs in conservation. New derivative based insurance products (financial instruments designed to allow the commoditization and sale of risk) have been developed that allow investors to insure risk in exchange for fixed payments. Modifications to these financial derivatives which are used to distribute risk and stabilize forecasts across many corporate and social scenarios could allow purchasers to take preventative action to simultaneously protect their investment and decrease the likelihood of the insured event. We propose that governments issue modified derivative contracts to sell species extinction risk to market investors and stakeholders. Using the endangered red cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in the US as an example we show how a biodiversity derivatives program could proactively generate new funding result in more cost effective conservation align stakeholders interests and create incentives for private conservation efforts. 1136:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding how species and ecosystems respond to climate change requires spatially and temporally rich data for a diverse set of species and habitats combined with models that test and predict responses. Yet current study is hampered by the long known problems of inadequate management of data and insufficient description of analytical procedures especially in the field of ecology. Despite recent institutional incentives to share data and new data archiving infrastructure many ecologists do not archive and publish their data and code. Given current rapid rates of global change the consequences of this are extreme: because an ecological dataset collected at a certain place and time represents an irreproducible set of observations ecologists doing local independent research possess in their file cabinets and spreadsheets a wealth of information about the natural world and how it is changing. Although large scale initiatives will increasingly enable and reward open science we believe that change demands action and personal commitment by individuals from students and PIs. Herein we outline the major benefits of sharing data and analytical procedures in the context of global change ecology and provide guidelines for overcoming common obstacles and concerns. If individual scientists and laboratories can embrace a culture of archiving and sharing we can accelerate the pace of the scientific method and redefine how local science can most robustly scale up to globally relevant questions. 113:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecology is the study of natural systems at the community level. So how do ecologists account for the role of people who follow rules different from most other organisms and communities? Now that human activity has grown into a global ecological force some ecologists are finding that traditional ecological theory does not provide good ways of understanding systems dominated by human activity. The authors examine a case in point the city and ask how ecological theory can modified to include human behavioral strategies. The authors suggest ways of modeling urban ecosystems by adopting tools from both biology and social science. 1162:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Over the last 50 years the ____great acceleration____ in human development has impacted our social systems ecosystems and climate in unprecedented ways simultaneously escalating and exposing the global interconnectivity of humans and the rest of nature. In academia researchers have observed documented and debated dimensions of these changes__ but largely within their own disciplines. We now face a profound failure of knowledge: most people are unaware of their most basic ecological dependencies. As we look ahead and consider what continuing on this pathway would mean for life as we know it the limitations of our knowledge systems are becoming uncomfortably evident. Yet meeting the challenge of providing a new integrative understanding means we need to do unfamiliar and even uncomfortable things. 116:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Emotions are essential but little understood components of research; they catalyze and sustain creative scientific work and fuel the scientific and intellectual social movements (SIMs) that propel scientific change. Adopting a micro sociological focus we examine how emotions shape two intellectual processes central to all scientific work: conceiving creative ideas and managing skepticism. We illustrate these processes through a longitudinal study of the Resilience Alliance a tightly networked coherent group collaborating at the center of a burgeoning scientific social movement in the environmental sciences. We show how emotions structured and were structured by the groups growth and development and how socio emotive processes facilitated the rapid production of highly creative science and helped overcome skepticism by outsiders. Hot spots and hot moments that is brief but intense periods of collaboration undertaken in remote and isolated settings fueled the groups scientific performance and drove the SIM. Paradoxically however the same socio emotive processes that ignited and sustained creative scientific research also made skepticism more likely to occur and more difficult to manage. Similarly emotions and social bonding were essential for the groups growth and development but increased size and diversity have the potential to erode the affective culture that generated initial successes. 1176:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large floods can have major impacts on riparian forests. Here we examine the variability and spatial distribution of riparian forest responses along eight third to fifth order streams following a large flood ( similar to 100 year recurrence interval) in the Cascade Mountain Range of Oregon We categorized disturbance intensity (physical force) exerted on riparian trees during floods into three classes: (i) purely fluvial (high water flow only); (ii) fluvial supplemented by dispersed pieces of floating wood (uncongested wood transport); (iii) fluvial with movement of batches of wood (congested wood transport). These types of material transport and associated classes of disturbance intensity resulted in a gradient of biotic responses of disturbance severity ranging from standing riparian trees inundated by high water to trees toppled but still partially rooted to complete removal of trees. High within stream and among stream responses were influenced by pre flood stream and riparian conditions as well as flood dynamics especially the availability of individual pieces or congested batches of wood. Fluvial disturbance alone toppled fewer riparian trees than in reaches where floodwaters transported substantial amounts of wood. Debris flows delivered additional wood and sediment to parts of reaches of four of these study streams; riparian trees were removed and toppled for up to 1.5 km downstream of the debris flow tributary channel. Congested wood transport resulted in higher frequency of toppled trees and greater deposition of new wood levees along channel margins. The condition of the landscape at the time of a major flood strongly influenced responses of riparian forests. Recent and historic land use practices as well as the time since the previous large flood influenced not only the structure and age of the riparian forests but also the availability of agents of disturbance such as large pieces of floating wood that contribute to disturbance of riparian forests during floods. 1207:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Americans have always feared floods and with good reason. Floods are the most common and costly large natural disturbances affecting the United States. Approximately 9 of every 10 presidential disaster declarations are associated with them. Floods took more than 200 lives between 1990 and 1995 and total flood damage costs between 1990 and 1997 reached nearly  DoLlQuAnT 34 billion. We have spent even more than that trying to control floods by building structures such as levees and dams to modify the ways rivers flow. Although we understand all too well the damage floods do we have not until recently understood very well the many beneficial aspects of flooding. Floods are critical for maintaining and restoring many of the important services provided to humans by riparian ecosystems. Among other things flooding provides critical habitat for fish waterfowl and wildlife and helps maintain high levels of plant and animal diversity. Floodwaters also replenish agricultural soils with nutrients and transport sediment that is necessary to maintain downstream delta and coastal areas. Indeed recent attempts in the United States to restore riverine ecosystems have increasingly turned to   managed   floods the manipulation of water flows from dams and other impoundments to achieve the benefits of flooding. As our understanding of floods has deepened it has become apparent that floods present us with a paradox. On the one hand we want to prevent them because they threaten our lives and ways of life. On the other hand we find ourselves searching for ways to allow or even reintroduce flooding because it supports the biological infrastructure that makes valued aspects of our lives possible. Thus flood control per se cannot be effective over the long term. Rather the key is a new more informed kind of flood management one that involves working with the forces of nature instead of simply trying to eliminate them. 1208:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, For too long humanitys effects on the oceans have been out of sight and out of mind. Looking at the vast ocean from the shore or a jets window it is hard to imagine that this seemingly limitless area could be vulnerable to human activities. But during the past decade reports have highlighted the consequences of human activity on our coasts and oceans including collapsing fisheries invasive species unnatural warming and acidification and ubiquitous dead zones induced by nutrient runoff. These changes have been linked not to a single threat but to the combined effects of the many past and present human activities that affect marine ecosystems directly and indirectly. The declining state of the oceans is not solely a conservation concern. Healthy oceans are vital to everyone even those who live far from the coast. More than 1 billion people worldwide depend on fish as their primary protein source. The ocean is a key component of the climate system absorbing solar radiation and exchanging absorbing and emitting oxygen and carbon dioxide. Ocean and coastal ecosystems provide water purification and waste treatment land protection nutrient cycling and pharmaceutical energy and mineral resources. Further more than 89 million Americans and millions more around the world participate in marine recreation each year. As coastal populations and demand for ocean resources have grown more and more human activities now overlap and interact in the marine environment. Integrated management of these activities and their effects is necessary but is just beginning to emerge. In Boston Harbor for example a complicated mesh of navigation channels offshore dumping sites outflow pipes and recreational and commercial vessels crisscrosses the bay. Massachusetts like other states and regions has realized the potential for conflict in this situation and is adopting a more integrated framework for managing these and future uses in the harbor and beyond. In 2007 California Oregon and Washington also agreed to pursue a new integrated style of ocean management that accounts for ecosystem interactions and multiple human uses. This shift in thinking is embodied in the principles of ecosystem based management an integrated approach to management that considers the entire ecosystem including humans. The goal of ecosystem based management is to maintain an ecosystem in a healthy productive and resilient condition so that it can provide the services humans want and need taking into account the cumulative effects and needs of different sectors. New York State has passed legislation aimed at achieving a sustainable balance among multiple uses of coastal ecosystems and the maintenance of ecological health and integrity. Washington State has created a regional public private partnership to restore Puget Sound with significant authority for coordinated ecosystem based management. These examples reflect a promising and growing movement toward comprehensive ecosystem based management in the United States and internationally. However efforts to date remain isolated and relatively small in scale and U.S. ocean management has largely failed to address the cumulative effects of multiple human stressors. 1226:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Increasingly river managers are turning from hard engineering solutions to ecologically based restoration activities in order to improve degraded waterways. River restoration projects aim to maintain or increase ecosystem goods and services while protecting downstream and coastal ecosystems. There is growing interest in applying river restoration techniques to solve environmental problems yet little agreement exists on what constitutes a successful river restoration effort. We propose five criteria for measuring success with emphasis on an ecological perspective. First the design of an ecological river restoration project should be based on a specified guiding image of a more dynamic healthy river that could exist at the site. Secondly the rivers ecological condition must be measurably improved. Thirdly the river system must be more self sustaining and resilient to external perturbations so that only minimal follow up maintenance is needed. Fourthly during the construction phase no lasting harm should be inflicted on the ecosystem. Fifthly both pre and post assessment must be completed and data made publicly available. Determining if these five criteria have been met for a particular project requires development of an assessment protocol. We suggest standards of evaluation for each of the five criteria and provide examples of suitable indicators. Billions of dollars are currently spent restoring streams and rivers yet to date there are no agreed upon standards for what constitutes ecologically beneficial stream and river restoration. We propose five criteria that must be met for a river restoration project to be considered ecologically successful. It is critical that the broad restoration community including funding agencies practitioners and citizen restoration groups adopt criteria for defining and assessing ecological success in restoration. Standards are needed because progress in the science and practice of river restoration has been hampered by the lack of agreed upon criteria for judging ecological success. Without well accepted criteria that are ultimately supported by funding and implementing agencies there is little incentive for practitioners to assess and report restoration outcomes. Improving methods and weighing the ecological benefits of various restoration approaches require organized national level reporting systems. 1231:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The spatial structure of plant communities can have strong impacts on ecosystem functions and on associated animal communities. None the less spatial structure is rarely used as a measure of restoration success. The restoration of hundreds of wetlands in the prairie pothole region in the mid western USA provided an excellent opportunity to determine whether the re establishment of abiotic conditions is sufficient to restore structure composition and spatial patterning of the vegetation. We mapped the topography and vegetative distributions in 17 restored and nine natural wetlands. We used these data to compare the composition and spatial structure of the vegetation in both wetlands types. The composition of the plant communities differed between restored and natural wetlands; the restored wetlands lacked the well developed sedge meadow community found in most natural wetlands. However the spatial heterogeneity was similar although the zonation patterns were less well developed in the restored wetlands. Although the overall structure was similar species distributions differed among wetland types such that species were found more than 10 cm higher in restored wetlands than in natural wetlands. This study illustrates that restored plant community composition and spatial structure may converge on their targets at different rates. Evaluations of restoration success should consider spatial structure of communities along with compositional and functional metrics. 1328:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The potential for understanding and where necessary managing sedimentation in humid mountain drainage basins increases with awareness of the conditions that lead to shallow landsliding debris flows and catastrophic sedimentation in stream channels. Progress in understanding has involved: improved recognition of source areas and the potential for downstream effects of slope failure; improved understanding of hydrological conditions required for failure; and a general theory of slope stability in shallow colluvium including the role of plants fires timber harvest and other disturbances. The theory acknowledges spatial variability in topographic and geotechnical terrain characteristics the stochastic nature of climatic triggering events such as forest fires and rainstorms and the integrating nature of channel networks in modulating the cumulative effects of transient processes within a basin. Anthropogenic fire regimes road effects and timber harvest can readily be included. Continued application and modification of the theory over an expanded geographical range require improvements in field data and their systematic storage in spatial databases. Improvements in digital topographic data for mountain basins systematic network wide surveys of channel conditions and new technology for rapid documentation of soil depths in landslide source areas would enhance the prediction of mass failure its consequences for channel habitat and the basin wide or regional distribution of hillslope and channel conditions. Computations of the probabilities of transient effects throughout basins could then form the basis of ecological risk analyses. Large scale spatial data sets of a few critical variables are required before this next level of understanding can be developed and applied to sedimentation impacts on ecosystems and other resources. 1357:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Natural resources and their management have played an important role in shaping Ugandas national identity since 1986. Through Ugandas decentralization agenda the perception of unprotected forests and wetlands have gone from being wasteland and essentially ignored in the political arena to key elements in securing livelihoods and important topics within political platforms. Despite the successes of government decentralization and legislated devolution of rights and responsibilities to the local level mandated regulations instituted by the central government can remain ignored or unheard of locally. What governs local resource use is a combination of prescriptive national legislation and regulations local by laws and perceived ownership. Usufruct rights of forests and wetlands largely depend on local circumstances which are unique to individual communities or particular forests and wetlands. This paper describes the entwined recent history of decentralization and natural resource management legislation in Uganda. We then present a case study of local perceptions of access and use of unprotected wetlands and forests in western Uganda. We show that there is confusion among local residents and village leaders with regards to access and use of these areas despite prescribed national legislation. We suggest that better operational success of resource management at the local level could be achieved by disseminating information at multiple levels. This need is particularly pressing in the more remote areas of the country where forest and wetlands face enormous pressure from high population growth and heavy human reliance on natural resources. 1358:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We review claims linking both payments for carbon and poverty to deforestation. We examine these effects empirically for Costa Rica during the late 20th century using an econometric approach that addresses the irreversibilities in deforestation. We find significant effects of the relative returns to forest on deforestation rates. Thus carbon payments would induce conservation and also carbon sequestration and if land users were poor could conserve forest while addressing rural poverty. We note that the poor appear to be marginalized in the sense of living where land profitability is lower. Those areas also have more forest. We find that poorer areas may have a higher supply response to payments but even without this effect poor areas might be included and benefit more due to higher (per capita) forest area. They might be included less due to transactions costs though. Unless the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol is modified in its implementation to allow credits from avoided deforestation such benefits are likely to be limited. 1362:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Data on permits for new housing starts are a key source of information on recent changes in the urban landscape of central Arizona USA. Drawing primarily on the conceptual parallels between the process of urban expansion and the spatial spread of non human species we outline a nested series of colonization models that could be used to study changes in urban landscapes through simulations of housing starts. Within our probabilistic colonization framework the ecological principle of density dependence (operating simultaneously on different spatial scales) governs the positioning of new housing units. These simple models afford a great diversity of possible spatial patterns ranging from tight clustering of houses to urban sprawl to more subtle patterns such as aversion of housing developments from (and aggregation near) different kinds of landscape features. These models can be parameterized from a variety of types of governmental housing data. Ultimately such a framework could be used to contrast development patterns among cities and identify pertinent operational scales and factors influencing processes associated with urbanization. 1402:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central challenge for natural resource management is developing rigorous yet practical approaches for balancing the costs and benefits of diverse human uses of ecosystems. Economic theory has a long history of evaluating tradeoffs in returns from different assets to identify optimal investment strategies. There has been recent progress applying this framework to the delivery of ecosystem services in land use planning. However despite growing national and international interest in marine spatial planning there is a lack of parallel frameworks in the marine realm. This paper reviews an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis framework and provides a more comprehensive synthesis for how it can be applied to marine spatial planning and marine ecosystem based management. A tradeoff analysis approach can reveal inferior management options demonstrate the benefits of comprehensive planning for multiple interacting services over managing single services and identify compatible services that provide win win management options. . 1403:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Implementation of marine ecosystem based management requires improved understanding of existing governance including gaps and overlaps resulting from fragmented management. Focusing on overlaps this paper presents a technique using text analysis to assist in the identification of agencies and laws involved in overlaps from a system perspective. The overlaps analysis uses term frequency counts on ocean laws and regulations in conjunction with relevant agency authority. Such information delivered in a transparent user friendly presentation can help policymakers and other constituents of ecosystem based management to find existing overlaps as a step to facilitate improved coordination. 1408:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper discusses some of the challenges and opportunities that can arise when implementing ecosystem based management (EBM) in tropical nations. EBM creates a new series of challenges problems and opportunities that must be considered in light of existing governance and management frameworks in a local context. The paper presents five case studies from different parts of the tropical world including Oceania insular and continental Southeast Asia East Africa and the Caribbean which illustrate that the implementation of EBM in watershed and marine ecosystems offers a new series of challenges and opportunities for its inclusion with existing forms of environmental governance and management. The paper suggests that EBM is best thought of as an expansion of customary management (CM) and integrated coastal management (ICM) rather than a paradigm shift and that it has certain benefits that are worth integrating into existing systems when possible. The paper concludes that the cultural and institutional context of CM as well as the experience technical skills and legal basis that serve ICM programs are logical platforms from which to build EBM programs. Some guidelines for creating hybrid management regimes are suggested. In sum declining marine species and ecosystems require urgent action necessitating utilization of existing paradigms such as ICM and CM as a foundation for building EBM. . 1437:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Back in 2001 I sat at the rear of a classroom with Jane Lubchenco co founder of the Aldo Leopold Leader ship Program while scientists stepped forward to share their fears and failures concerning communicating with the media and policy makers. I get a lot of calls from the press and I don t return most of those calls confessed Margaret Palmer a restoration ecologist at the University of Maryland in College Park. A wave of sympathetic laughter rippled through the audience. After that two week communications training workshop Palmer decided to change her ways. Earlier this year she co authored a paper challenging US government policies that allow irreversible ecological damage through mountain top mining in the pursuit of cheap coal. An avalanche of attention included an invitation to appear on the satirical television show The Colbert Report. This time Palmer returned the call. Despite Stephen Colberts bombastic efforts to disarm her Palmer laughed leaned in and scored a series of carefully prepared points while 1.2 million viewers watched. Palmer has become well known not just as a scientist but as a leader. Her prominence has helped the University of Maryland become the finalist pending formal approval by the review board for a prestigious US National Science Foundation funded (environmental synthesis research) centre to produce policyrelevant science with the active participation of decision makers. In other words science designed to make a difference. This year more than ever before a chorus of voices has been summoning scientists to emerge from their laboratories and become better communicators. Little has been said about one important reason for doing so: the intrinsic link between communication and leadership. Its no coincidence that environmental scientists who lead the pack both within academia and beyond are good communicators. These scientists know how to articulate a vision focus a debate and cut to the essence of an argument. They can make a point compelling even to those who disagree. They talk about their science in ways that make people sit up take notice and care. After a decade of working with scientists as a communications coach and trainer I am encouraged by the increasing number of scientists who are now chiselling doors and windows in the ivory tower to reach out. A new breed of communication savvy researchers is emerging __ albeit perhaps not fast enough. For scientists who would be agents of change communication is not an add on. It is central to their enterprise. They begin with a goal in mind frame their research questions to produce useful results and think about how they will disseminate the information. Yet learning to communicate is a critical life skill not typically taught as part of scientific training. It should be. SpotlightS or headlightS? This year during the Climategate affair climate scientists froze in the face of scandal only to become the pi atas of sceptics and deniers. Bashing these scientists continues to be a favourite pastime of the Tea Party politicians in the United States despite those involved being cleared of wrong doing by several independent review panels. Any vindication has been largely ignored because as Mark Twain purportedly said: A lie can make it half way around the world before the truth has time to put its boots on. Now after losing ground in the court of public opinion climate scientists are finally rallying __ stepping up to answer questions address misconceptions and actively counter misinformation and deception. One group of scientists has set up a rapid response team promising quick turnaround to queries from government officials or the media. The American Geophysical Union relaunched a climate question and answer service for the United Nations climate talks in Canc__n Mexico earlier this month __ to address questions of science not policy. These are valuable steps to try to ensure scientific accuracy in the face of heated political rhetoric and wild conspiracy theories. But alone they aren t enough. Its important to remember that not answering what policy makers want and need to know leaves a void __ one that contrarians are only too happy to fill. I concur with the late Stanford University climatologist Stephen Schneiders view: Staying out of the fray is not taking the high ground ; it is just passing the buck. He believed that it is both possible and important to comment on policy without compromising scientific integrity. He would often say: If you are asking me as a scientist I would answer it this way __ If you are asking me as a citizen I would say __ In this way he made his point without overstating his science and became extremely influential. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates how other scientists who have devoted time to thinking about communication have risen to positions to help lead policy. Lubchenco now the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was an early advocate for scientists to communicate. In her call to arms __ a 1998 paper in Science __ she entreated scientists to be more forthcoming and share their research to benefit government managers policy makers and society at large. Next she helped launch the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program and the Communication Partnership for Science and the Sea (COMPASS). Both of these initiatives help scientists connect with the media and policy makers and deliver a bottom line to those with little time or patience. As the first marine ecologist to lead NOAA an agency of about 12 800 employees Lubchenco knew her task was daunting. The oil spill provided a real test. Even this veteran communicator could not control how the media presented mixed messages and rapidly unfolding events. In August Lubchenco was criticized for painting too rosy a picture of how fast the oil was being dispersed. Her message of do not prematurely prejudge the impacts was lost in the media clips. Lubchenco persevered consistently reiterating what was and wasn t known about the oil its effects and its final fate. By November the message was picked up. Her experience gave her the patience and persistence needed. Scientists with a history of interest and practice in communication continue to have important roles in the oil spills ongoing saga. Donald Boesch president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science is one of only two scientists on US President Barack Obamas seven member commission on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and offshore drilling. He was probably chosen from many qualified scientists because of his communication skills. Boesch is known for his ability to talk to people __ from all walks of life __ in a way that compels them to act. He is sympathetic analytical and adaptive rather than superior doctrinaire and inflexible. And he readily admits that he learns from his failures as well as from his successes. Boesch has taken criticism from some peers for being too much in the public eye. He says the rewards of knowing that he is making a difference are worth it. On numerous occasions a governor has told him about a recent piece of scientific work in the news not realizing that Boesch had brought it to the medias attention in the first place. Boesch knows that the media helps to set the agenda of policy makers and the public and uses that system accordingly. Boesch hopes he can help guide the commission with a rigorously documented report that recommends actions to improve human and environmental safety. But it is his ability to communicate those recommendations rather than his ability to help compile a report that will ultimately make a difference. Pursuing communication as a high priority sometimes brings turbulence to academic careers. When something gets widely reported the subsequent discussion in talk radio television and the blogosphere can distort the facts like a funhouse mirror. Defending oneself can eat up valuable hours. Attacks can come from industry ideologues or even colleagues. Boris Worm a marine ecologist from Dalhousie University in Halifax Canada for example faced critiques that he had overreached his results in two papers about fish depletion that got a lot of public attention. Instead of getting defensive he engaged with his critics __ and ultimately ended up collaborating with them8. Most scientists I know who have felt such backlashes have few regrets. They dust themselves off and respond with more and better science. Their concern for the environment trumps their fear of criticism and the progress they see in policies justifies their efforts. Not every scientist wants to step up to the microphone __ nor do they all need to. But for those who aim to change the world __ and many graduate students and postdocs do __ some changes to the academic system would help. If young scientists are going to hone communication skills they need the support of senior scientists to protect their interests and reputations at crucial junctures in their careers. In choosing an adviser they should align themselves with scientists who have solid credentials and who share their values about outreach. Increasingly many senior scientists are developing communication courses for their students that range from one day workshops to accredited courses. time well Spent In my work with scientists I often hear that they cannot afford the time to work on their communication skills with their hectic research publishing and teaching schedules. I see it another way: they cannot afford not to. Many of the most prolific and accomplished scientists have risen to the top of their field by conducting significant relevant research and working out how to communicate it within their discipline and beyond. They know the value of being quizzed by Congress or the media even if at times it can be uncomfortable. Going public forces them to distil the essence of their work and to think harder about the questions __ what is known and what is left to discover. Worms philosophy is that engaging with thoughtful criticism __ even if it seems harsh in the media spotlight __ makes everyone think more deeply and makes us push harder against the limits of the unknown. Thats why sharpening communication skills has value beyond increasing public understanding. It can breach interdisciplinary boundaries within science and help colleagues with different viewpoints catch a glimpse of a bigger picture. Articulating vision and common goals has long been a cornerstone of leadership on the battlefield. Scientists would be wise to adopt a similar strategy. Being a good communicator is not a trade off. It makes you a better scientist.  1440:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Indira Samarasekera calls for more effective collaboration among universities governments and the private sector in her Opinion article. Her arguments are not new __ they have been central to research policy and sociology of science debates for more than 60 years (see for example V. Bush Science: The Endless Frontier US Office of Scientific Research and Development). Todays tools for efficient literature searches are on hand to prevent old debates from continually resurfacing. Keeping track of developing ideas by conscientious referencing is essential. Then to act upon what has been learned we must remember. As scientists we remember collectively through cited publications. This particular debate is important because it challenges the very core of science by discussing how and why knowledge is made used and mobilized. We should be drawing on the valuable insights from previous decades in our attempts to set a new social contract for science. 1444:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sir __ Your News Feature Doing it for the kids highlights INSPIRE a science education scheme in the United Kingdom where postdocs pursue a teaching qualification while continuing with their research. Although there are many positive attributes to INSPIRE your feature acknowledges the schemes heavy reliance on special funding which may disappear in the future. As noted in the News Feature the United States currently lacks programmes equivalent to INSPIRE. But there are other US programmes that achieve many of the same goals with the help of volunteers and without the need for additional funding. One example of this is Kids Do Ecology (KDE) an outreach programme run through the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara California. This programme pairs postdocs at NCEAS with classes of 10 year olds at local schools. Each volunteer scientist visits his or her class about six times during the spring guiding students through the scientific process by helping them develop a research question and hypothesis design experimental methods and conduct the experiment. At the end of the semester students from each class present their projects to other students and the NCEAS community at a poster session. A description of the experiments can be found on each classs web page hosted through the KDE website. The benefits of KDE are many. It provides scientists with the opportunity to participate in community outreach gives students some hands on science experience and introduces a scientist role model to the classroom. The programme requires a minimal time commitment from the postdocs about 20 hours in total on a volunteer basis and consequently has a small budget. KDE is a sustainable model for getting scientific expertise into the classroom and participation has remained high since its inception in 1997: 11 scientists visited classes at four Santa Barbara schools this year. The framework for KDE is simple and effective and could easily be adopted by other research institutions wanting to inspire student interest in science. 1449:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Policies for managing plastic debris are outdated and threaten the health of people and wildlife say Chelsea M. Rochman Mark Anthony Browne and colleagues. Last year 280 million tonnes of plastic was produced globally. Less than half of it was consigned to landfill or recycled. Of the remaining 150 million tonnes some may still be in use; the rest litters continents and oceans (see Plastic world). Plastic debris can physically harm wildlife Moreover many plastics may be chemically harmful in some contexts either because they are themselves potentially toxic or because they absorb other pollutants4 Yet in the United States Europe Australia and Japan plastics are classified as solid waste so are treated in the same way as food scraps or grass clippings. We believe that if countries classified the most harmful plastics as hazardous their environmental agencies would have the power to restore affected habitats and prevent more dangerous debris from accumulating. Ultimately such a move could boost research on new polymers and replace the most problematic materials with safer ones. It is now almost impossible to walk in the countryside or on a beach without encountering bits of plastic. Larger pieces from bottles and bags to floating pontoons can transport species to new habitats where they might do damage. Such debris can kill or injure ecologically and commercially important species including mussels salt marsh grasses and corals Mammals reptiles and birds can also be harmed through eating plastic or becoming entangled in it. Last year the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal Canada reported that all sea turtle species 45 PeRcEnT of marine mammal species and 21 PeRcEnT of seabird species can be harmed in this way. 1452:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A doubling in global food demand projected for the next 50 years poses huge challenges for the sustainability both of food production and of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide to society. Agriculturalists are the principal managers of global useable lands and will shape perhaps irreversibly the surface of the Earth in the coming decades. New incentives and policies for ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and ecosystem services will be crucial if we are to meet the demands of improving yields without compromising environmental integrity or public health. 1483:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ocean plays a critical role in supporting human well being from providing food livelihoods and recreational opportunities to regulating the global climate. Sustainable management aimed at maintaining the flow of a broad range of benefits from the ocean requires a comprehensive and quantitative method to measure and monitor the health of coupled human ocean systems. We created an index comprising ten diverse public goals for a healthy coupled human ocean system and calculated the index for every coastal country. Globally the overall index score was 60 out of 100 (range 36 86) with developed countries generally performing better than developing countries but with notable exceptions. Only 5 PeRcEnT of countries scored higher than 70 whereas 32 PeRcEnT scored lower than 50.

They contribute to human welfare both directly and indirectly and therefore represent part of the total economic value of the planet. We have estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes based on published studies and a few original calculations. For the entire biosphere the value (most of which is outside the market) is estimated to be in the range of US DoLlQuAnT 16 54 trillion (10(12)) per year with an average of US DoLlQuAnT 33 trillion per year. Because of the nature of the uncertainties this must be considered a minimum estimate. Global gross national product total is around US DoLlQuAnT 18 trillion per year. 1526:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Bias or any set of factors that influence the general expression of merit is common in science and is an inevitable by product of an imperfect but otherwise reasonably objective human pursuit to understand the world we inhabit. In this paper we explore the conceptual significance of a relatively tractable form of bias namely publication and dissemination bias. A specific definition is developed a working model of classification for publication bias is proposed and an assessment of what we can measure is described. Finally we offer expectations for ecologists with respect to the significance of bias in the publication process within our discipline. We argue that without explicit consideration of both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of publication bias in ecology we limit our capacity to fairly assess and best use the science that we as a community produce. 153:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,155:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,155:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystems provide many of the material building blocks for human well being. Although quantification and appreciation of such contributions have rapidly grown our dependence upon cultural connections to nature deserves more attention.

We characterize these connections on the basis of the channels through which such connections arise  knowing perceiving interacting with and living within) and the components of human well being they affect  physical mental and spiritual health inspiration identity).

However implementation of ecosystem based management (EBM) faces major operational challenges including accurately delineating the links between ecosystem components and benefits to humans and quantifying trade offs associated with different management decisions. It is suggested using human activity level as an indicator of the benefit provided by marine ecosystems at a certain location in comparison with other locations and establishing links between human activity levels and ecological conditions. This approach allows for the determination of what ecological conditions may provide the greatest human benefits and thus may be targets for management action. This approach is used to investigate the link between scuba diving in the Monterey Bay area California USA and different ecological characteristics of kelp forests. Diving intensity levels correlate with kelp persistence suggesting that kelp persistence may be used as an indicator of benefits from diving and for evaluating the impact of potentially competing activities through their effects on kelp. Overall an operational definition of marine ecosystem services is provided and it is suggested that this method could be extended to a suite of different activities and systems and thus may become useful in considering trade offs among different activities that depend upon the same ecosystem.  160:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Detecting human impacts on riverine systems is challenging because of the diverse biological chemical hydrological and geophysical components that must be assessed. We briefly review the chemical biotic hydrologic and physical habitat assessment approaches commonly used in riverine systems. We then discuss how landscape indicators can be used to assess the status of rivers by quantifying land cover changes in the surrounding catchment and contrast landscape level indicators with the more traditionally used approaches. Landscape metrics that describe the amount and arrangement of human altered land in a catchment provide a direct way to measure human impacts and can be correlated with many traditionally used riverine indicators such as water chemistry and biotic variables. The spatial pattern of riparian habitats may also be an especially powerful landscape indicator because the variation in length width and gaps of riparian buffers influences their effectiveness as nutrient sinks. The width of riparian buffers is also related to the diversity of riparian bird species. Landscape indicators incorporating historical land use may also hold promise for predicting and assessing the status of riverine systems. Importantly the relationship between an aquatic system attribute and a landscape indicator may be non linear and thus exhibit threshold responses. This has become especially apparent from landscape indicators quantifying the percent impervious surface (or urban areas) in a watershed a landscape indicator of hydrologic and geomorphic change. 162:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1656:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ecosystem services concept provides a means to define successful disease management more broadly beyond short term crop yield evaluations. Plant disease can affect ecosystem services directly such as through removal of plants providing services or indirectly through the effects of disease management activities including pesticide applications tillage and other methods of plant removal. Increased plant biodiversity may reduce disease risk if susceptible host tissue becomes less common or may increase risk if additional plant species are important in completing pathogen life cycles. Arthropod and microbial biodiversity may play similar roles. Distant ecosystems may provide a disservice as the setting for the evolution of pathogens that later invade a focal ecosystem where plants have not evolved defenses. Conversely distant ecosystems may provide a service as sources of genetic resources of great value to agriculture including disease resistance genes. Good policies are needed to support conservation and optimal use of genetic resources protect ecosystems from exotic pathogens and limit the homogeneity of agricultural systems. Research is needed to provide policy makers farmers and consumers with the information required for evaluating trade offs in the pursuit of the full range of ecosystem services desired from managed and native ecosystems. 1657:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Least obvious at any rate to modern urbanized man is the effect of our present highly complex fauna and flora organized as they are into communities upon the environment itself. Through reaction upon habitat these communities not only insure an orderly cycle of material and energy transformations but also regulate the moisture economy cushion the earths surface against violent physiographic change and make possible the formation of soil. In short man is dependent upon other organisms both for the immediate means of survival and for maintaining habitat conditions under which survival is possible. A major challenge for the United States as it continues to urbanize is how to make cities more livable while reducing their environmental impacts: how to urbanize more sustainably. Urban areas have substantial environmental impacts on air and water quality and on habitat; they consume high rates of energy and materials especially in developed countries; and they contribute significant fossil fuel emissions. Yet in some ways the call for sustainability is simply the most recent iteration of an historic environmentally oriented critique of the industrial city. Among its forms have been the Garden City Movement at the turn of the twentieth century the Regional Plan Association of the 1920s and 1930s Ian McHargs Design With Nature and present day calls for smart growth and urban limit lines. Maintaining the health of natural systems in urban areas is thus not a new problem. Yet it has remained a relatively intractable one. One reason for this difficulty is that the benefits people obtain__or might obtain__from ecosystems are not well taken into account. Natural systems are either subsumed into real estate transactions (as unacknowledged aspects of a piece of land); operate as a common good that may or may not be subject to regulation such as air or water quality; or are viewed as an engineering challenge such as water purification. Whatever the case no value is assigned to them. An important component of moving toward greater urban sustainability is thus lost. Better ways must be found to value natural services in urban and metropolitan fiscal policy and planning.  167:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1691:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Social scientists have suggested that cultural diversity in a nation leads to societal instability. However societal instability may be affected not only by within nation or alpha diversity but also diversity between a nation and its neighbours or beta diversity. It is also necessary to distinguish different domains of diversity namely linguistic ethnic and religious and to distinguish between the direct effects of diversity on societal instability and effects that are mediated by economic conditions. We assembled a large cross national dataset with information on alpha and beta cultural diversity economic conditions and indices of societal instability. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of cultural diversity on economics and societal stability. Results show that different types and domains of diversity have interacting effects. As previously documented linguistic alpha diversity has a negative effect on economic performance and we show that it is largely through this economic mechanism that it affects societal instability. For beta diversity the higher the linguistic diversity among nations in a region the less stable the nation. But religious beta diversity has the opposite effect reducing instability particularly in the presence of high linguistic diversity. Within nation linguistic diversity is associated with reduced economic performance which in turn increases societal instability. Nations which differ linguistically from their neighbors are also less stable. However religious diversity between neighboring nations has the opposite effect decreasing societal instability. 1741:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Increasing human appropriation of freshwater resources presents a tangible limit to the sustainability of cities agriculture and ecosystems in the western United States. Marc Reisner tackles this theme in his 1986 classic Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water. Reisners analysis paints a portrait of region wide hydrologic dysfunction in the western United States suggesting that the storage capacity of reservoirs will be impaired by sediment infilling croplands will be rendered infertile by salt and water scarcity will pit growing desert cities against agribusiness in the face of dwindling water resources. Here we evaluate these claims using the best available data and scientific tools. Our analysis provides strong scientific support for many of Reisners claims except the notion that reservoir storage is imminently threatened by sediment. More broadly we estimate that the equivalent of nearly 76 PeRcEnT of streamflow in the Cadillac Desert region is currently appropriated by humans and this figure could rise to nearly 86 PeRcEnT under a doubling of the regions population. Thus Reisners incisive journalism led him to the same conclusions as those rendered by copious data modern scientific tools and the application of a more genuine scientific method. We close with a prospectus for reclaiming freshwater sustainability in the Cadillac Desert including a suite of recommendations for reducing region wide human appropriation of streamflow to a target level of 60 PeRcEnT. 1749:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine spatial planning (MSP) is an emerging responsibility of resource managers around the United States and elsewhere. A key proposed advantage of MSP is that it makes tradeoffs in resource use and sector (stakeholder group) values explicit but doing so requires tools to assess tradeoffs. We extended tradeoff analyses from economics to simultaneously assess multiple ecosystem services and the values they provide to sectors using a robust quantitative and transparent framework. We used the framework to assess potential conflicts among offshore wind energy commercial fishing and whale watching sectors in Massachusetts and identify and quantify the value from choosing optimal wind farm designs that minimize conflicts among these sectors. Most notably we show that using MSP over conventional planning could prevent   DoLlQuAnT 1 million dollars in losses to the incumbent fishery and whale watching sectors and could generate   DoLlQuAnT 10 billion in extra value to the energy sector. The value of MSP increased with the greater the number of sectors considered and the larger the area under management. Importantly the framework can be applied even when sectors are not measured in dollars (e. g. conservation). Making tradeoffs explicit improves transparency in decision making helps avoid unnecessary conflicts attributable to perceived but weak tradeoffs and focuses debate on finding the most efficient solutions to mitigate real tradeoffs and maximize sector values. Our analysis demonstrates the utility feasibility and value of MSP and provides timely support for the management transitions needed for society to address the challenges of an increasingly crowded ocean environment. 175:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1778:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Triple bottom line outcomes from resource management and conservation where conservation goals and equity in social outcomes are maximized while overall costs are minimized remain a highly sought after ideal. However despite widespread recognition of the importance that equitable distribution of benefits or costs across society can play in conservation success little formal theory exists for how to explicitly incorporate equity into conservation planning and prioritization. Here we develop that theory and implement it for three very different case studies in California (United States) Raja Ampat (Indonesia) and the wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that equity tends to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to achieve conservation objectives such that similar conservation outcomes can be possible with greater equity to a point. However these case studies also produce a range of trade off typologies between equity and conservation depending on how one defines and measures social equity including direct (linear) and no trade off. Important gaps remain in our understanding most notably how equity influences probability of conservation success in turn affecting the actual ability to achieve conservation objectives. Results here provide an important foundation for moving the science and practice of conservation planning and broader spatial planning in general toward more consistently achieving efficient equitable and effective outcomes. 1786:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With increasing pressure placed on natural systems by growing human populations both scientists and resource managers need a better understanding of the relationships between cumulative stress from human activities and valued ecosystem services. Societies often seek to mitigate threats to these services through large scale costly restoration projects such as the over one billion dollar Great Lakes Restoration Initiative currently underway. To help inform these efforts we merged high resolution spatial analyses of environmental stressors with mapping of ecosystem services for all five Great Lakes. Cumulative ecosystem stress is highest in near shore habitats but also extends offshore in Lakes Erie Ontario and Michigan. Variation in cumulative stress is driven largely by spatial concordance among multiple stressors indicating the importance of considering all stressors when planning restoration activities. In addition highly stressed areas reflect numerous different combinations of stressors rather than a single suite of problems suggesting that a detailed understanding of the stressors needing alleviation could improve restoration planning. We also find that many important areas for fisheries and recreation are subject to high stress indicating that ecosystem degradation could be threatening key services. Current restoration efforts have targeted high stress sites almost exclusively but generally without knowledge of the full range of stressors affecting these locations or differences among sites in service provisioning. Our results demonstrate that joint spatial analysis of stressors and ecosystem services can provide a critical foundation for maximizing social and ecological benefits from restoration investments. 1808:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many cultural attributes such as adornment language slang mannerisms and rituals are thought to have little or no influence on individual survival and reproduction functioning rather as markers of cultural identity that promote group cohesion. Here I show that if cultural markers are under weak selection and subject to loss or substitution then the breakdown of cultural cohesiveness may proceed without stabilizing reactions until many or most of a cultures identifiers are forever lost. This may culminate in a cultural meltdown whereby the culture is caught in a vortex of ever decreasing membership and insufficient selection against the accumulation of unfamiliar markers. In progressively altering the topology of communication from diffusion to broadcasting globalization may be both accelerating the erosion of cultural identities and amplifying dominance behaviours above their normal adaptive levels. 185:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1860:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The desire to conserve biodiversity is driving significant aspects of economic policy formation. Some of these policies such as the Endangered Species Act in the United States have real consequences for resource allocation especially land use. It is therefore appropriate to ask questions about biodiversity__what exactly is it what are the economic consequences of its loss or retention? As economists what can we say about biodiversity? These are important and challenging issues with which our profession is only beginning to grapple. This special issue of Resource and Energy Economics is a further step in that process: it assembles a collection of articles that except for one all have in common a focus of economic analysis on some aspect of biodiversity or its conservation. The exception is the paper by Armsworth Kendall and Davis. By three ecologists this paper provides an overview of what ecologists mean by biodiversity and of how they make this concept measurable and operational. Readers will quickly see from this that biodiversity is a set of ideas and issues rather than a single precisely defined quantity. It stands for the total range of biological variability in naturally occurring organisms including the variability at all levels from the genetic to the species and community. Nehring and Puppe also address the measurement of biodiversity though from a very different perspective: they look at axiomatic approaches to defining diversity in the context of phylogenetic trees trees that show the relationships between ancestor and descendant organisms. Roughly speaking we expect that organisms may be more different from each other if their last common ancestor is further back. Central to the literature to which Nehring and Puppe contribute is the development of this intuition into an operational measure of diversity. To an outsider looking in at the biologists discussion of biodiversity or at least to this outsider it seems as if there are several quite distinct issues that are of concern here. One is that natural ecosystems are complex and highly interdependent so that small changes can lead to far reaching and unexpected repercussions. One example is the contribution that the extinction of passenger pigeons may have made to the emergence of Lyme disease as a serious problem in the US. Another is the impact of eliminating a keystone species such as sea otters in the California coastal marine environments (Power . 1996). In both cases the loss of one species lead to cascading changes that most observers would probably not have expected changes that were incidentally to the disadvantage of humans. Another issue that seems to motivate biologists concern about biodiversity is the possible social value of the organisms that are being lost. When a species goes extinct are we losing a unique chemical that could be the basis of a cure for cancer? This raises the issue of the value of biodiversity as a basis for bioprospecting an issue on which there is an interesting literature already and to which this volume does not contribute. In economists terms biologists feel that there are real option values associated with biodiversity conservation. This is a priori a reasonable position__extinction which is what loss of biodiversity amounts to in its more dramatic form is irreversible we are not sure of the value to society of what will be lost through extinction and we may well learn more about this as time passes. So all the preconditions for real option values are satisfied which is perhaps a reason for being cautious about the loss of biodiversity. In sum biologists see the loss of biodiversity as destabilizing the natural environment and as the loss of great potential for good.  1866:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper examines a model of the decisions made by developing country protected area managers that recognizes that rural people react to policies differently in various market settings. For each of three market settings the paper identifies the make up of an optimal management plan that consists of three possible policies: enforcement agricultural development projects and conservation payments. The results ground a discussion of the likelihood of success of conservation policies the failure of integrated Conservation and Development Projects and the use of some policies as mechanisms to compensate rural people for lost access to resources within protected areas. 1868:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We consider the optimal regulation of an open access fishery when biomass dynamics are combined with fishing effort dynamics. The interaction of inelastic demand and backward bending nature of the ecological supply curve introduce nonlinearities that could lead to multiple bionomic equilibria and hysteresis effects. We obtain convergence results for general bionomic models and indicate cases where hysteretic regulation failure could be a problem when economic dynamics are slow enough relative to biological dynamics. We show that when biological dynamics are slow enough relative to the economic dynamics the social optimum can be achieved by a time dependent landing fee. 1869:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ideally restoration practice should be based on restoration ecology. The latter is a heuristic discipline dedicated to ecological knowledge and theory pertinent to the renewal of ecosystems that have been degraded or otherwise converted. This ideal for restoration practice has yet to be realized. The scientific sophistication of restoration practice can scarcely conceal two of a practitioners mainstays__a green thumb and a flair for old fashioned natural history. We do not say this in a pejorative sense because ecosystems have indeed been restored such as the Curtis Prairie in Madison Wisconsin particularly when the practitioner was unfettered by temporal limitations and other common constraints. Practitioners are individuals who are involved with the design and implementation of specific restoration efforts. The successes of practitioners can be traced ultimately to the most fundamental principle of synecology__ that species naturally self organize into communities. The reasons why self organization occurs are legion and ecologists have yet to fully unravel them. Practitioners need a much firmer ecological foundation for developing and implementing restoration programs. Ecologists in turn need well conceived restoration programs to serve as laboratories for deciphering the complexities of ecological dynamics that lead to the organization of biological communities. Practitioners and ecologists can expedite their respective work by resolving each others problems. We feel compelled to note that the practitioner and the restoration ecologist are sometimes the same person. The ecologist as practitioner must make tenuous ecological assumptions if a restoration program is to be realized. The practitioner as ecologist is handicapped by the messiness and multivariate nature of a full fledged restoration project which may defy the best intentions for replicated experimental design. The mutually satisfactory engagement of practice and theory is therefore the ultimate challenge in restoration ecology. This paper attempts to define the problems practitioners face with hopes that restoration ecologists will take heed and attempt their solutions. We offer 15 issues that we identify as important for supporting restoration practice. These issues include project planning soil development genetic selection biotic establishment and project evaluation. The wide range of expertise needed to answer our questions demonstrates the multidisciplinary breadth of ecological restoration and the opportunities awaiting investigators in many disciplines who can contribute their talents to the renewal of nature. We state the central question for each issue. Then we identify the practical problem that stimulated the question. Finally we propose avenues of appropriate investigation. 1870:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological restoration is still very much in the hands of managers and is moving only very slowly into the scientific realm of restoration ecology. There are by now thousands of restoration and reclamation projects across the country but only a small proportion of them has been planned scrutinized and measured by ecologists and other scientists. Jordan . admonished in 1987 that restoration research could contribute to ecologists understanding of the basic structure and functioning of systems but relatively few scientists have as yet availed themselves of the opportunity to do restoration related research. This may in part be due to the fact that scientists have not considered the conceptual basis of restoration biology. To help alleviate this and to encourage more biologists to become involved in restoration a group of ecologists and land managers gathered for two and a half days in April 1996 to discuss the conceptual basis of restoration biology. The papers that follow are the products of discussions from that workshop. The workshop was organized at the behest of the National Science Foundation (NSF) which has just ended an eight year Special Program in Conservation and Restoration Biology (CRB). Most previous research in restoration either had been funded privately or where state and federal funds were involved was more often for the utilitarian purposes of reclamation or rehabilitation. This was the first time restoration was treated as a legitimate area for basic research. The CRB Program seemed like a move to help improve the quality of restoration research and promote increased participation by academic researchers. However the results of the program were disappointing. Out of some 15 proposals funded each year on average only one or two were restoration proposals. This reflected the small proportion of restoration proposals submitted and considered fundable (within the top 10 PeRcEnT 20 PeRcEnT) by the CRB panel. It also raised the question of why so few researchers chose to submit restoration proposals. In contrast the program has been enormously successful for conservation researchers who submitted the bulk of the funded proposals. Conservation genetics and population level conservation research have made great strides in both basic and applied research since 1989 and have become part of mainstream research in population ecology and genetics. Mainstreaming is the intent of special programs at NSF the idea being to promote areas that previously have been neglected raising them to the status of traditional research areas. Special programs at NSF are designed to last some four years but after eight years of the CRB Program restoration research still has not become part of ecological mainstream research and has progressed little in conceptual development since 1989. At the workshop we discussed the belief that few ecologists choose to submit proposals because restoration is still viewed as a discipline without the conceptual basis needed to support basic research. Michael Soul and Kathryn Kohms book Research Priorities for Conservation Biology helped to develop the conceptual basis for conservation biology but a similar approach has never been taken for restoration ecology. While Soul and Kohm discussed restoration they presented restoration as an agronomic practice to be performed by land managers not a scientific discipline. They argued that we should be more concerned with conserving existing land than with restoring disturbed sites. In spite of this view among some conservation biologists interest in restoration research has been increasing and ecologists have pointed out the need for restoration to develop its own conceptual base. The workshop was held at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara. Of the 37 participants about one third were practicing restorationists and or agency researchers and two thirds had university affiliations. There were approximately equal proportions of participants with interests in population community ecosystem and landscape ecology representing both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Special talks were given on restoration topics on each of these hierarchical levels. One of the discussion points was that the scientific approach to ecosystem and landscape ecology is so different from that toward population ecology genetics that these areas are difficult to evaluate in one combined CRB panel. The group recognized that restoration research has special limitations that make it more difficult to do research than in other areas. These included the use of large areas to be restored at great expense the lack of replication and the lack of control in general and the need for a reference or a restoration goal. Additional talks addressed these special needs including statistical approaches for unreplicated designs that are commonplace in restoration research the reference concept for restoration and the need for interactions between researchers and practitioners. Perhaps more importantly research and management agencies need to work together and interaction needs to occur at all levels from the federal government to the individuals doing the work. The conceptual and practical issues are discussed at length in each of the papers below. The one paper by practitioners takes a different tack from the conceptual papers. While recognizing the need for a conceptual framework they also call for site specific information such as species lists knowledge of successional processes definitions of safe sites for specific projects natural history of organisms etc. At the same time theoretical constructs are needed that can help predict the success of a project given a set of initial conditions and specified interventions. Ecologists and practitioners need to work on several fronts together to solve these problems and there is room here for ecologists working at all levels from natural historians to theoreticians. The workshop report to the NSF is available on the World Wide Web site of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at http: www.nceas.ucsb.edu nceas.web rsrch proposals 95ALLEN1 results1.html. A synopsis of the workshop has been published in Restoration and Management Notes 14(2):148 150. As a final note the NSF is still keen to fund research in conservation and restoration. The workshop members made a number of recommendations to improve restoration funding. One of them was to have a separate panel exclusively for restoration research. This did not come about but for the final CRB panel in January 1997 restoration was emphasized and more restoration proposals were submitted than in previous competitions. The other recommendation was to subsume restoration research into the existing NSF programs so that proposals dealing with specific hierarchical levels could be reviewed by panels organized around those levels. The decision by NSF was to mainstream the CRB program into the regular panels of the Division of Environmental Biology including the Ecosystem Ecology Population Biology and Systematics Programs. Funds will be earmarked for conservation and restoration that will be available for proposals submitted to each of these panels. The consensus of the workshop members was that this should be a viable method to fund restoration research and we look forward to increased restoration research funding by NSF. 1873:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As part of the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) we developed a summary database of 4 023 stream restoration projects built in California since 1980 from which we randomly selected 44 records for in depth interviews with project managers. Despite substantial difficulties in gathering the data we were able to draw conclusions about current design implementation monitoring and evaluation practices used in California projects and compare them with national trends. Although more than half of the projects for which we conducted interviews were located in watersheds for which a management or assessment plan had been prepared these plans had a limited impact on site selection. We also found that the state lacks a consistent framework for design monitoring and reporting restoration projects and that although monitoring is far more widespread than the information in the NRRSS summary database would suggest there are still problems with the type duration and reporting of monitoring. The general lack of systematic objective assessment of completed projects hinders the advance of restoration science. 1875:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite expenditures of more than I billion dollars annually there is little information available about project motivations actions and results for the vast majority of river restoration efforts. We performed confidential telephone interviews with 317 restoration project managers from across the United States with the goals of (1) assessing project motivations and the metrics of project evaluation and (2) estimating the proportion of projects that set and meet criteria for ecologically successful river restoration projects. According to project managers ecological degradation typically motivated restoration projects but post project appearance and positive public opinion were the most commonly used metrics of success. Less than half of all projects set measurable objectives for their projects but nearly two thirds of all interviewees felt that their projects had been   completely successful.   Projects that we classified as highly effective were distinct from the full database in that most had significant community involvement and an advisory committee. Interviews revealed that many restoration practitioners are frustrated by the lack of funding for and emphasis on project monitoring. To remedy this we recommend a national program of strategic monitoring focused on a subset of future projects. Our interviews also suggest that merely conducting and publishing more scientific studies will not lead to significant improvements in restoration practice; direct collaborative involvement between scientists managers and practitioners is required for forward progress in the science and application of river restoration. 1876:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite some highly visible projects that have resulted in environmental benefits recent efforts to quantify the number and distribution of river restoration projects revealed a paucity of written records documenting restoration outcomes. Improving restoration designs and setting watershed priorities rely on collecting and making accessible this critical information. Information within the unpublished notes of restoration project managers is useful but rarely documents ecological improvements. This special section of Restoration Ecology is devoted to the current state of knowledge on river restoration. We provide an overview of the sections articles reflecting on lessons learned which have implications for the implementation legal and financing frameworks for restoration. Our reflections are informed by two databases developed under the auspices of the National River Restoration Science Synthesis project and by extensive interactions with those who fund implement and permit restoration. Requiring measurable ecological success criteria comprehensive watershed plans and tracking of when and where restoration projects are implemented are critical to improving the health of U.S. waters. Documenting that a project was put in the ground and stayed intact cannot be equated with ecological improvements. However because significant ecological improvements can come with well designed and implemented stream and river restorations a small investment in documenting the factors contributing to success will lead to very large returns in the health of our nations waterways. Even projects that may appear to be failures initially can be turned into success stories by applying the knowledge gained from monitoring the project in an adaptive restoration approach. 1877:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Hundreds of millions of dollars per year are spent on river restoration in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) but little is known about the effectiveness of this effort. To help address this gap we analyzed a database containing 23 000 projects at 35 000 locations in the region. We selected a subset of these projects for interviews using a survey instrument developed by a national team of scientists. In total 47 project contacts in the PNW were interviewed to learn from the individuals directly involved in restoration. At least one third of the projects surveyed (34 PeRcEnT) did not conduct sufficient monitoring to evaluate effectiveness. More than two thirds (70 PeRcEnT) of all respondents reported their projects were successful but 43 PeRcEnT either have no success criteria or are unaware of any criteria for their project. Although almost two thirds (66 PeRcEnT) of respondents anticipate a need for ongoing project maintenance less than half (43 PeRcEnT) have maintenance funds available. These findings suggest that establishing a connection between effectiveness monitoring and project implementation is not a usual component of project design. Consequently we can only assess the benefits in a few isolated projects and cannot quantify the cumulative benefits of restoration on a larger scale. These findings highlight the need for (1) planning prior to implementation of restoration projects that accounts for monitoring design; (2) coordinated effectiveness monitoring to assess cumulative effects of restoration; and (3) management and maintenance of projects based on real measures of project performance. 1878:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Landscape ecology focuses on questions typically addressed over broad spatial scales. A landscape approach embraces spatial heterogeneity consisting of a number of ecosystems and or landscape structures of different types as a central theme. Such studies may aid restoration efforts in a variety of ways including (1) provision of better guidance for selecting reference sites and establishing project goals and (2) suggestions for appropriate spatial configurations of restored elements to facilitate recruitment of flora fauna. Likewise restoration efforts may assist landscape level studies given that restored habitats possessing various patch arrangements or being established among landscapes of varying diversity and conditions of human alteration can provide extraordinary opportunities for experimentation over a large spatial scale. Restoration studies can facilitate the rate of information gathering for expected changes in natural landscapes for which introduction of landscape elements may be relatively slow. Moreover data collected from restoration studies can assist in validation of dynamic models of current interest in landscape ecology. We suggest that restoration and landscape ecology have an unexplored mutualistic relationship that could enhance research and application of both disciplines. 1880:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Restoration activity has exponentially increased across the Southwest since 1990. Over 37 000 records were compiled into the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) database to summarize restoration trends and assess project effectiveness. We analyzed data from 576 restoration projects in the Southwest (NRRSS SW). More than 50 PeRcEnT of projects were less than or equal to 3 km in length. The most common restoration project intent categories were riparian management water quality management in stream habitat improvement and flow modification. Common project activities were well matched to goals. Conservative estimates of total restoration costs exceeded  DoLlQuAnT 500 million. Most restoration dollars have been allocated to flow modification and water quality management. Monitoring was linked to 28 PeRcEnT of projects across the Southwest as opposed to just 10 PeRcEnT nationwide. Mean costs were statistically similar whether or not projects were monitored. Results from 48 telephone interviews provided validation of NRRSS SW database analyses but showed that project costs are often underreported within existing datasets. The majority of interviewees considered their projects to be successful most often based upon observed improvements to biota or positive public reaction rather than evaluation of field data. The efficacy of restoration is difficult to ascertain given the dearth of information contained within most datasets. There is a great need for regional entities that not only track information on project implementation but also maintain and analyze monitoring data associated with restoration. Agencies that fund or regulate restoration should reward projects that emphasize monitoring and evaluation as much as project implementation. 1881:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Restoration ecologists use reference information to define restoration goals determine the restoration potential of sites and evaluate the success of restoration efforts. Basic to the selection and use of reference information is the need to understand temporal and spatial variation in nature. This is a challenging task: variation is likely to be scale dependent; ecosystems vary in complex ways at several spatial and temporal scales; and there is an important interaction between spatial and temporal variation. The two most common forms of reference information are historical data from the site to be restored and contemporary data from reference sites (sites chosen as good analogs of the site to be restored). Among the problems of historical data are unmeasured factors that confound the interpretation of historical changes observed. Among the problems of individual reference sites is the difficulty of finding or proving a close match in all relevant ecological dimensions. Approximating and understanding ecological variation will require multiple sources of information. Restoration by its inherently experimental nature can further the understanding of the distribution causes and functions of natures variation. 1882:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, River restoration is an integral part of restoring the Chesapeake Bay. As part of the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) we conducted 47 independent interviews with stream restoration project managers randomly selected from a database of 4 700 projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Here we present results from those interviews and characterize patterns in project goals design and expenditures trends in project evaluation and characterize project success as reported by interviewees. Interviewed practitioners reported that the majority of their projects were designed by private consultants. One third of projects were part of a watershed management plan and 70 PeRcEnT were linked to other projects within the same watershed. Most interviewees considered their projects to be successful and 76 PeRcEnT of projects had conducted some form of project associated monitoring. Although most interviewees based their evaluation of success on observations or monitoring data respondents indicated that very few projects had explicitly stated quantifiable project objectives within their design plans. Many interviewed practitioners specifically commented at the end of the surveys on the important role of stakeholder involvement and the need for initiatives to fund project monitoring. 1883:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Stream restoration has become a multibillion dollar industry worldwide yet there are few clear success stories and the scientific basis for effective stream restoration remains uncertain. We compiled data on completed river restoration projects from four management authorities in Victoria Australia to examine how the available data could inform the science of restoration ecology in rivers and thus improve future restoration efforts. We found that existing data sources are limited and much historical information has been lost through industry restructuring and poor data archiving. Examining records for 2 247 restoration projects we found that riparian management projects were the most common followed by bank stabilization and in stream habitat improvement. Only 14 PeRcEnT of the project records indicated that some form of monitoring was carried out. It is evident that overall there is little scientific guidance and little or no monitoring and evaluation of the projects for which we had information. However recent advances with mandatory statewide reporting and an increased emphasis on project design and monitoring strongly suggest that the design implementation monitoring and reporting of stream restoration projects have improved in recent years and will continue to do so. 1884:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Successional models are used to predict how restoration projects will achieve their goals. These models have been developed on different spatial and temporal scales and consequently emphasize different types of dynamics. This paper focuses on the restoration goal of self sustainability but only in the context of a long term goal. Because of the temporal scale of this goal we must consider the impact of processes arising outside of the restoration site as of greater importance than restoration itself. Because ecological systems are open restoration sites will be subjected to many external influential processes. Depending on the landscape context the impact of these processes may not be noticeable or at the other extreme they may prevent the achievement of restoration objectives. A second issue is to emphasize the nature of processes in the long term that they are a complex of characteristics such as magnitude frequency and extent. Ecological systems are only adapted to a range of values in each of these characteristics. Restoration often combines goals that are of different scales. Models appropriate to these goals need consideration. 1885:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ecosystem perspective provides a framework within which most other aspects of the ecology of restoration can be incorporated. By considering the ecosystem functions of a restoration project the restorationist is forced to consider the placement of the project in the landscape its boundaries its connections or lack thereof to adjoining ecosystems and its receipts and losses of materials and energy from its physical surroundings. These characteristics may set limits on the kind(s) of biotic communities that can be created on the site. The ecosystem perspective also gives restorationists conceptual tools for structuring and evaluating restorations. These include the mass balance approach to nutrient pollutant and energy budgets; subsidy stress effects of inputs; food web architecture; feedback among ecosystem components; efficiency of nutrient transfers primary productivity and decomposition as system determining rates; and disturbance regimes. However there are many uncertainties concerning these concepts their relation to each other and their relationships to population and community level phenomena. The nature of restoration projects provides a unique opportunity for research on these problems; the large spatial scale of restorations and the freedom to manipulate species soil water and even the landscape could allow ecosystem level experiments to be conducted that could not be performed otherwise. 1886:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We collected information on 860 stream restoration projects in four states in the southeastern United States Georgia Kentucky North Carolina and South Carolina to gain a better understanding of the practice of stream restoration in this area of high aquatic biodiversity and rapid metropolitan expansion. This was completed as a part of the National River Restoration Science Synthesis with the larger goal of understanding the state of the science of stream restoration. Stream restoration project density goals and monitoring rates varied by state although southeastern monitoring rates were higher than in other parts of the country. North Carolina had the most projects in the Southeast of which 36 PeRcEnT were monitored. In depth phone interviews with project managers from a random subsample of projects provided insights into the process of stream restoration. Land availability was the most common basis for site prioritization and 49 PeRcEnT of projects involved mitigation. Although 51 PeRcEnT of projects were associated with a watershed assessment only 30 PeRcEnT of projects were done as part of a larger plan for the watershed. Projects were monitored using physical (77 PeRcEnT of monitored projects) chemical (36 PeRcEnT) and biological (86 PeRcEnT) variables although many projects were planned and ultimately evaluated based on public opinion. Our results suggest that stream restoration in the southeastern United States is at an exciting point where better incorporation of a watershed perspective into planning and establishment and evaluation of stated measurable success criteria for every project could lead to more effective projects. 1887:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We conducted systematic postproject appraisals (PPAs) of seven compound channel restoration projects supplementing available data with new field data and analyses to produce comparable datasets for all seven projects. We describe how systematic PPAs can be developed and illustrate a systematic PPA for compound channel projects organized around performance with respect to geomorphic habitat and conveyance objectives. We found that preexisting monitoring programs for a group of similar restoration projects can be supplemented with relatively low effort data collection and analyses to produce lessons on a   class   of restoration projects. Using this approach to assess a set of seven compound channel projects we found that two fully achieved geomorphic objectives three appear likely to achieve geomorphic objectives with additional time and or minor interventions and two did not achieve geomorphic objectives. Further four projects achieved habitat objectives and three projects appeared likely to achieve objectives if given more time to develop and or a minor intervention to mitigate limitations on critical ecological processes. Finally four of the projects satisfied conveyance objectives and the remaining three appeared likely to satisfy objectives with minor interventions to maintain design roughness and geometry conditions. Based on observations from our new systematic PPA approach applied to compound channels in Mediterranean climates we suggest application of systematic PPAs for other classes of river restoration projects to evaluate scale and geomorphic setting issues in project design to refine postproject monitoring guidelines and to predict vegetation recruitment growth and succession patterns to avoid potential vegetation problems. 18:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ecosystem services concept is used to make explicit the diverse benefits ecosystems provide to people with the goal of improving assessment and ultimately decision making. Alongside material benefits such as natural resources  clean water timber) this concept includes through the cultural category of ecosystem services diverse non material benefits that people obtain through interactions with ecosystems  spiritual inspiration cultural identity recreation). Despite the longstanding focus of ecosystem services research on measurement most cultural ecosystem services have defined measurement and inclusion alongside other more material services. This gap in measurement of cultural ecosystem services is a product of several perceived problems some of which are not real problems and some of which can be mitigated or even solved without undue difficulty. Because of the fractured nature of the literature these problems continue to plague the discussion of cultural services. In this paper we discuss several such problems which although they have been addressed singly have not been brought together in a single discussion. There is a need for a single accessible treatment of the importance and feasibility of integrating cultural ecosystem services alongside others. 1910:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The importance of rivers and streams for fresh water food and recreation is well known yet there is increasing evidence that degradation of running waters is at an all time high. More than one third of the rivers in the United States are listed as impaired or polluted (2) and freshwater withdrawals in some regions are so extreme that some major rivers no longer flow to the sea year round. Extinction rates of freshwater fauna are five times that for terrestrial biota. Fortunately stream and river restoration can lead to species recovery improved inland and coastal water quality and new areas for wildlife habitat and recreational activities. River restoration has become a highly profitable business and will play an increasing role in environmental management and policy decisions. A few high profile and large restoration projects such as those on the Kissimmee River and the Grand Canyon are well documented. However most restoration projects are small scale (implemented on less than 1 km of stream length) and information on their implementation and outcome is not readily accessible. This prompted us to build a database of river restoration across the United States with the goal of determining the common elements of successful projects. We found that existing restoration databases are highly fragmented and often rely on ad hoc or volunteer data entry. Thus we developed methods for the unbiased collection and cataloging of river and stream restoration projects. Here we report a synthesis of information on 37 099 projects in the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) database. The NRRSS database includes all stream and river restoration projects present in national databases as of July 2004 as well as a large sample of river and stream restoration projects from seven geographic regions. Because we wanted to document how restoration dollars and efforts were allocated we did not limit data collection to projects that fit our definition of restoration. No judgments were made of the validity of the terms stream restoration or project. Use of national coverage data sources ensured inclusion of projects from all 50 states. For the seven specific regions we also collected information on all restoration projects for which we could obtain data regardless of project size restoration method implementer or perceived success or failure of the project. We identified a priori 13 categories of restoration and classified each project according to its stated goal. The number of river restoration projects increased exponentially during the last decade paralleling the increase in news media and scientific reports. However restoration efforts varied across geographic regions. Most projects (88 PeRcEnT) are from the Pacific Northwest the Chesapeake Bay watershed or California. Data from national coverage sources made up  8 PeRcEnT of projects in the NRRSS database. Thus while federal funding supports some tracking efforts national restoration databases are not tracking the majority of projects and lack information on the regional differences in expenditures and effort found with our approach. The most commonly stated goals for river restoration in the United States are (i) to enhance water quality (ii) to manage riparian zones (iii) to improve in stream habitat (iv) for fish passage and (v) for bank stabilization. Projects with these goals are typically small in scale with median costs of   DoLlQuAnT 45K. A large proportion of restoration dollars are spent on fewer more expensive projects aimed at reconnecting floodplains modifying flows improving aesthetics or recreation and reconfiguring river and stream channels. Of the projects in our database 20 PeRcEnT had no listed goals; in many cases descriptions were too limited to determine whether projects were undertaken to restore stream ecosystems or were merely river manipulation projects  bank stabilization). Only 58 PeRcEnT of the project records used to populate our database had information on project costs. For this subset total costs came to  DoLlQuAnT 9.1 billion. Most of this was spent after 1990 with  DoLlQuAnT 7.5 billion in recorded costs from 1990 to 2003 (from the 58 PeRcEnT reporting costs). Applying this cost estimate to the remaining 40 PeRcEnT of projects and taking into account that we captured 27 PeRcEnT of all stream and river restoration projects in the 27 states not within one of our regional nodes at least  DoLlQuAnT 14 to  DoLlQuAnT 15 billion has been spent on restoration of streams and rivers within the continental United States since 1990 an average of   DoLlQuAnT 1 billion a year. This is probably an underestimate because data providers reported that the costs listed in project records typically do not include matching or in kind contributions such as agency labor. In addition the data sources we accessed did not capture costs for the restoration of the Kissimmee River or the full costs of Glen Canyon San Francisco Bay Columbia and Missouri river restoration efforts which would add hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Our analysis confirms what the General Accounting Office (GAO) has suggested in recent reports to the U.S. Congress: a comprehensive assessment of restoration progress for the United States or even for individual regions is not possible with the piecemeal information currently available. We found that only 10 PeRcEnT of project records indicated that any form of assessment or monitoring occurred. Most of these 3700 projects were not designed to evaluate consequences of restoration activities or to disseminate monitoring results. Monitoring and assessment varied by region:  20 PeRcEnT of projects in the Southwest Southeast and Central United States had some form of monitoring whereas only 6 PeRcEnT of project records in the Chesapeake Bay watershed indicated that monitoring occurred. Projects with higher costs were more likely to be monitored average costs were  DoLlQuAnT 1.5 __  DoLlQuAnT 0.7 million (95 PeRcEnT CI) whereas unmonitored project costs were  DoLlQuAnT 0.4 __  DoLlQuAnT 0.08 million . Regions with greater project density tended to have lower average project costs and reported a lower rate of monitoring. Further differences in regional regulations are likely. Because most project records were inadequate to extract even the most rudimentary information on project actions and outcomes it is apparent that many opportunities to learn from successes and failures and thus to improve future practice are being lost. The largest and most costly programs have recognized this problem and have enacted solutions. Unfortunately the outcomes of most of the tens of thousands of projects of small to modest size are currently not adequately tracked yet cumulatively their costs are greater and their reach is far broader. Much greater effort is needed to gather and disseminate data on restoration methods and outcomes particularly given the magnitude of costs. It is unrealistic to expect that every restoration project will have extensive monitoring activities but strategic pre and post assessments with standardized methods could enable restoration practitioners and managers to understand what types of activity are accomplishing their goals. Ensuring data compatibility in the tracking of restoration projects and the documentation of results from project evaluations are equally important. To facilitate this effort the NRRSS database structure and schema are freely available. 191:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1932:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, During the next 50 years which is likely to be the final period of rapid agricultural expansion demand for food by a wealthier and 50 PeRcEnT Larger global population will be a major driver of global environmental change. Should past dependences of the global environmental impacts of agriculture on human population and consumption continue 10(9) hectares of natural ecosystems would be converted to agriculture by 2050. This would be accompanied by 2.4 to 2.7 fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus driven eutrophication of terrestrial freshwater and near shore marine ecosystems and comparable increases in pesticide use. This eutrophication and habitat destruction would cause unprecedented ecosystem simplification Loss of ecosystem services and species extinctions. Significant scientific advances and regulatory technological and policy changes are needed to control the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. 1939:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Food chain length (FCL) is a fundamental component of food web structure. Studies in a variety of ecosystems suggest that FCL is determined by energy supply environmental stability and or ecosystem size but the nature of the relationship between environmental stability and FCL and the mechanism linking ecosystem size to FCL remain unclear. Here we show that FCL increases with drainage area and decreases with hydrologic variability and intermittency across 36 North American rivers. Our analysis further suggests that hydrologic variability is the mechanism underlying the correlation between ecosystem size and FCL in rivers. Ecosystem size lengthens river food chains by integrating and attenuating discharge variation through stream networks thereby enhancing environmental stability in larger river systems. 193:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1957:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Planning and decision making can be improved by access to reliable forecasts of ecosystem state ecosystem services and natural capital. Availability of new data sets together with progress in computation and statistics will increase our ability to forecast ecosystem change. An agenda that would lead toward a capacity to produce evaluate and communicate forecasts of critical ecosystem services requires a process that engages scientists and decision makers. interdisciplinary linkages are necessary because of the climate and societal controls on ecosystems the feedbacks involving social change and the decision making relevance of forecasts. 1959:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Problems in ocean resource management derive from governance not science.

Using social network analysis the authors study how interactions between researchers policy makers affect utilization of research by policy makers in a boundary organization designed to mediate between research and policy communities. Two types of social interactions with independent effects on utilization are identified. Policy makers with more direct contacts with researchers are more likely to utilize research. Policy makers interacting more with other policy makers regarding research are also more likely to utilize it. This indicates the importance of policy makers embeddedness in social networks and the importance of external reputation of boundary organizations for successful knowledge transfer. 1978:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Raymond J. OConnor1 attributes what he calls the   faltering progress of ecological research   to lack of creativity on the part of ecologists and a failure to follow the examples of more   successful   sciences  molecular genetics and physics). We agree that ecology would benefit from a greater emphasis on generality and conceptual unification. However we take issue with both the contention that ecological science has failed to progress and that the approaches of other disciplines can be applied to ecology to produce more worthwhile science. OConnors evidence that ecology is unsuccessful takes three forms. First he contends that ecological hypotheses are focused on natural history and not general hypotheses about how ecological systems work. He cites three ecological studies that employ   rigorous analysis and logical thinking   and contends that these examples are anachronistic. These studies very well represent the state of the art in ecology. Even a casual look at recent issues of Ecology or The American Naturalist shows that most studies published in major journals are quantitative and mechanistic. In addition many synthetic studies are made possible only by the collection of descriptive data. For example the Human Genome Project which OConnor touts as a triumph is the ultimate testament to the power of natural history. The single largest   big science   project of modern biology a description of   what is   rather than a test of hypotheses about how things work will allow for tremendous advances in medicine. Progress toward conceptual unification in ecology also demands adequate descriptive data. The collection of these data should not be undervalued. Second OConnor uses the global persistence of environmental catastrophes such as the collapse of fisheries as a sign that ecological science has failed. The fact that environmental problems persist reflects many social economic and ecological factors not just poor science by ecologists. Many fishery failures reflect conscious decisions by government agencies to overexploit stocks or to ignore the council of fisheries biologists.2 The persistence of outstanding problems is also not unique to ecology. Does the fact that people still get sick reflect bad medical science or the complexity of disease biology combined with social factors? Third OConnor claims that ecology is weak because it has failed to produce a breakthrough on the magnitude of the Human Genome Project. While the National Science Foundations biocomplexity initiative was allotted  DoLlQuAnT 50 million in 2000 the Human Genome Project received  DoLlQuAnT 360.6 million from the U.S. Government.3 In addition much of the effort to map the genome is being funded by private concerns. Some ecology is supported by other agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency; however the fact remains that the resources spent on biomedical science vastly exceed those for ecology. Many of the apparent differences in progress between ecology and molecular biology are attributable to the disparity in how much support these programs receive. The types of questions we address make ecology fundamentally different from physics or molecular biology. The   question   motivating the Human Genome Project is:   What is the sequence of base pairs in human DNA.   Examples of ecological questions include:   What will be the effects of global warming on life on Earth      How much fishing will cause extinction of Pacific salmon    or   How does species diversity affect the functioning of ecosystems.   The answer to the genome question is definite not subject to uncertainty and easily studied in a laboratory using standard methods. The answers to the three ecological questions are context dependent subject to considerable uncertainty and cannot be studied under controlled conditions. For example the answer to the fishing question might well depend on the answer to the global warming question thereby magnifying the uncertainty. That the genome problem has a definitive solution reflects the fact that the answer can be spelled with the four letters A T C and G of DNA. The answers to the ecological questions are considerably more complex. We believe that much of the perception of ecologys weakness stems from the fact that the field includes both basic and applied branches. Although the three ecological questions mentioned above have no simple definite answers they are nonetheless of tremendous importance to society. Some studies are aimed not at producing general theories but at solving important practical problems. OConnors example of another study of   the fall feeding habits of white tailed deer in Maine   might be conceptually empty but could still be of tremendous value for managing deer herds in Maine. Generality should be a primary goal of ecologists and we agree with OConnor that it needs further emphasis. However generality comes from creating broad mechanistic theories and from testing them in many systems. Relevance comes from applying these ideas to questions that are important to society. The application of ecology to real issues is a sign of its strength not its weakness. 1982:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As scientific research becomes an increasingly larger portion of corporate expenditures pressure is mounting to make the processes more efficient. Data acquisition access management analysis and the sharing of all available resources will be at the core of the transformations needed to achieve the next level of efficiency in research organizations. However current data management technology is geared toward business data and several technical challenges remain to make it suitable for scientific data. A panel entitled Scientific Data Integration was held on March 25 h 2002 at the 8 th Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT) in Prague in the Czech Republic. The panel focused on the issues needed to be addressed to enable scientific data integration and discussed solutions. Omar Boucelma Universit de Provence and Zod Lacroix Arizona State University moderated the panel which included Silvana Castano Universit di Milano Carole Goble University of Manchester and Bertram LudRscher San Diego Supercomputer Center.  1987:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article examines the challenges and tensions that inhere in university based boundary organizations. We begin by reconceptualizing the theory of boundary organizations bringing it into greater alignment with the realities of the current university environment. Using in depth interviews documentary analysis and ethnographic field work this framework is applied to a university based boundary organization attempting to reconcile the needs of water policymakers university administrators university departments and funding agencies. These stakeholders place diverse conflicting demands on the boundary organization. Those demands create four sets of enduring tensions requiring ongoing management by the boundary organization. However the ability to manage these tensions is structured by constituents relative levels of power legitimacy and saliency. We show the importance of adaptive boundary management for managing these enduring tensions while also concluding that the demands of some stakeholders may be incommensurable. The article closes with a number of concrete suggestions for enhancing the efficacy of university based boundary organizations. 1989:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, University Technology Licensing Offices (TLOs) are strategic sites for examining efforts to concretize frame and market early stage technologies. This paper draws on 18 months of fieldwork in a private university TLO to analyze collective decision making efforts during licensing meetings. I describe three processes docket description deal framing and problem resolution that highlight the central roles that locally sensible strategies and languages play in describing and comparing disparate technologies. Such approaches reflect the collective experience of licensing associates and when rationalized through organizational learning represent the processual underpinnings of ongoing transformations in the institutional arrangements of US universities. Close examination of meeting discussions reveals multiple conceptual spaces that support TLO decision making and more closely connects theoretical work in science and technology studies with theories of organizational learning and with economic sociologys growing emphasis on commensuration. 1:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,2020:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, After many decades of separation environmental and ecological sciences have formally undertaken an effort to reintegrate humans back into nature. Recent concern with the human dimension represents a significant departure from historic traditions where the human nature boundary has formed the division between natural and social sciences. Now ecology and environmental sciences are thematically and functionally embedded in the social matrix and the interrelationships and interdependence between humans and nature constitute the primary drivers of much ecological research. Integrating natural and human sciences derives from the recognition that many issues dominating society today  pollution land use practices biodiversity conservation and overpopulation) involve linking social and ecological approaches. This is represented by the integration of the human and natural sciences in many recent programs  Man and the Biosphere the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Because of growing interest in integrating humans and nature an interdisciplinary group of scholars gathered to discuss recent changes in how the human nature boundary is perceived and implications for ecological and environmental sciences The group reflected the complex web of the human nature boundary and included scholars from diverse schools of ecology sociology psychology anthropology Native American science environmental education and philosophy. Hailing from different backgrounds interests and agendas surprisingly scholars converged on several common issues and goals. The diversity of topics discussed reflected the breadth and depth of issues involved in reintegrating humans and nature rather than disciplinary differences. Topics included: how can scientists and science contribute most to helping the plight of the natural world?; what is natural ?; the nature of time; the nature of scientific inquiry; the need for pluralism in science; how science implicitly embodies values and ethics; and how traditional models separating humans from nature are reflected in the fragmentation across disciplines organizations individuals and physical landscapes. Discussions of the human nature relationship and its treatment in models and other studies inevitably led to debates on science itself: how science defines and influences our perceptions of humans and nature. Amid differing views one main theme emerged: if it intends to adhere to its pledge to serve humanity the science community must change its perceptions in two essential ways. First ecologists and social scientists alike support the urgent need to move beyond a proscience versus antiscience stance . This means recognizing science as a social process embedded within its attendant history narrative and political economical personal and cultural assumptions much as any other worldview but having significant analytic a l power and use. One of the chief barriers to integrating natural and human sciences rises from the insistence by many (usually natural scientists) that science is value free and universally valid or objective. By contrast there are numerous identically accredited (usually social) scientists (not to mention entire cultures) who maintain that the refusal to recognize the dual nature of science as culture and method jeopardizes sciences coveted claim of political neutrality. The growing literature and research in natural and social science&3 supports the idea that there are many valid ways of knowing  western science Native science4F5 and experiential) and that none is dispensable given the compelling multicultural socioecological questions faced today. Without such recognition many practices of current science will be unable to address the multitude of boundary issues that characterize most research programs6  sustainability ecological restoration genetically modified organisms and biocomplexity). In lieu of pro versus antiscience debates it was suggested that efforts focus on developing conceptual frameworks that accommodate the spectrum of perspectives and processes offered by human natural and indigenous sciences to achieve successful integration. Second reductionist approaches are most effective when explicitly and consciously linked with a holistic conceptual framework that integrates nature and humans. Although providing a powerful analytic tool the mechanistic reductionist paradigm which dominates much of current science tends to fragment biological and human systems into parts. By focusing on the pieces and when practiced in isolation from holistic concepts reductionism in extreme has left science grasping for methods and theories of how to reconnect humans to nature. Integration that is the creation of holistic solutions to holistic problems was found to apply not only to interdisciplinary efforts but also across internal boundaries within an individual scientist. These challenges are faced in the day to day practice of science: personal professional beliefs intuition mind and spirit. From the perspective of the holistic framework suggested by integrating theories of social and natural sciences many of the boundary issues scientists find themselves confronting todays  debates on advocacy ethics and values) could be advanced with the acceptance of a parallel internal integration a recognition that scientists can operate both with their minds and their social conscience and can preserve scientific integrity and ethics. The path to achieving a holistic framework is not unprecedented. Models of interdisciplinary and internal integration are numerous particularly hard scientists who are renowned not only for their scientific contributions but also for their insights into the nature of life spirituality social responsibility ethics philosophy of science and holistic theories  Richard Feynmann Paul Davies David Suzuki Freeman Dyson David Bohm and Albert Einstein). By accepting the existence of the intertwining of science and values scientists are better positioned to address such difficult questions as how to translate human values into the language of biological and physical systems. For example one participant asked How do we decide how many values does it take to make a fact in public land use planning and decision making or how many trees and owls does it takes to satisfy a First Nations need for sacredness? Integration implies combining not only the two formerly separate objects of study (humans and nature) but also the subjects (human observer and scientist).Engaging in integration also implies considering a tangle of topics that do not necessarily fit neatly into any single arena. It is at these boundaries where integration becomes difficult and decoupling between social and natural scientists most often occurs  the concept of objectivity and its implications for framing science questions). Decoupling derives from apparent conceptual clashes as well as from insufficient institutional support for nontraditional endeavors. Because so called boundary topics often challenge deep seated cultural paradigms and require exploration into nontraditional waters it is necessary for institutions to support and to provide opportunities that legitimize such discussions as part of mainstream science. Failure to provide such support will prevent meaningful dialogue and encourage quick fix it solutions that merely amalgamate existing ideas but avoid critical and difficult questions. In this context integration involves rigorous examination by natural and social scientists of the concepts beliefs and politics in which science is embedded. This is not to say that integration demands the absence of any process of evaluation and acceptance; indeed the existence of boundaries and tension is an essential part of a dynamic process. However without such self reflection not only does science become a tool for cultural domination but also it severely undermines its own credibility in the eyes of nonscientists. To this end the group developed a declaration of independence . This declaration expresses some of these goals and defines the position of an integrated science relative to society and relative to the relationship of humans and nature. The declaration can be summarized as follows: science is social knowledge and as such demands practice within the scientific community which does not restrict research ways of knowing citizen inclusion and respect for nonhuman animals. Ecology and environmental sciences are recognized as interdisciplinary endeavors in which cooperation among the diverse sciences the humanities and human culture is necessary. It was also affirmed that research is accountable not only to funding institutions but also to the broad membership of the people and nature who are its  Knowledge must be used responsibly in the service of life. Furthermore to stimulate and sustain such science a parallel institutional shift is needed which removes a monopoly of privilege and allows for a system of accountability and decision making that reflects the cultural kaleidoscope in which science is embedded. Diversification at all levels in the process of knowledge generation and implementation is necessary to respond to these new socioecological needs. Many of the ideas discussed at the workshop are not new. However what is new in science today is the degree to which traditionally disparate fields have become consensual and are engaging in formerly nontraditional collaborations such as the recent conference The Good in Nature and Humanity held by the Schools of Forestry and Divinity at Yale University. These efforts reflect the desires of both the science community and society to move beyond platitudes and to tackle subjects formerly taboo to science. The challenges with which natural and social scientists are faced are difficult and complex but the collective bodies of knowledge accessible to science in conjunction with its own method of inquiry can create an effective cadre of scholars responsive to pressing socioecological issues. An honest and open effort to reintegrate social and natural sciences has the potential to bring definition and meaning to achieving sustainable and ethical relationships with nature. Participation in such collaborative research and discussion shows that science is well equipped to take this lead. The challenge remains whether science is willing to assume this role.  2030:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As global environmental problems intensify ecology is increasingly drawn into the social arena and many ecologists feel caught between two competing models of science: a science apart from society and a science directly engaged with society. Interdisciplinary research and integrative theories are helping resolve this conflict by providing a common framework for both biophysical and social sciences. The incorporation of the human dimension into ecology is reversing a century old trend of separation and reintegrating science into the human experience. 2035:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecology is evolving rapidly and increasingly changing into a more open accountable interdisciplinary collaborative and data intensive science. Discovering integrating and analyzing massive amounts of heterogeneous data are central to ecology as researchers address complex questions at scales from the gene to the biosphere. Ecoinformatics offers tools and approaches for managing ecological data and transforming the data into information and knowledge. Here we review the state of the art and recent advances in ecoinformatics that can benefit ecologists and environmental scientists as they tackle increasingly challenging questions that require voluminous amounts of data across disciplines and scales of space and time. We also highlight the challenges and opportunities that remain. 2037:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem engineers affect other organisms by creating modifying maintaining or destroying habitats. Despite widespread recognition of these often important effects the ecosystem engineering concept has yet to be widely used in ecological applications. Here we present a conceptual framework that shows how consideration of ecosystem engineers can be used to assess the likelihood of restoration of a system to a desired state the type of changes necessary for successful restoration and how restoration efforts can be most effectively partitioned between direct human intervention and natural ecosystem engineers. 203:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,205:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,2064:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The emerging interdisciplinary field of ecological economics should be a recognized research priority. Only through a combination of sound ecology and good economics can we hope to manage our exploitation of the biosphere in a manner that is both sustainable and efficient. This article is an invitation to ecologists to use economic tools and to participate in ecological economic debate. To this end we review basic ecological economic concepts and discuss how the field has arisen what benefits it offers and what challenges it must overcome. 2067:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is increasing interest in developing better predictive tools and a broader conceptual framework to guide the restoration of degraded land. Traditionally restoration efforts have focused on re establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization loss of native species pools shifts in species dominance trophic interactions and or invasion by exotics and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify prioritize and address these constraints. 2076:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Hundreds of wetlands comprising thousands of hectares have been restored in the Midwestern United States. In nearly all cases restoration consisted of simply restoring wetland hydrology. For this reason the success of these restorations relies on natural colonization. We compared the structure and composition of the vegetation in two types of wetlands: 10 natural wetlands and 17 five to seven year old restored wetlands. The overall vegetative composition of restored wetlands was different from that of natural wetlands. Restored wetland flora was formed from a subset of species found in natural wetlands. The species restricted to natural wetlands tended to be native perennials and were evenly represented along the elevational gradient. The few species that were restricted to restored wetlands were largely mudflat annuals whose presence is more indicative of the presence of more unvegetated habitat in restored wetlands than of the presence of a distinctive restored wetlands flora. In addition restored wetlands had lower vegetative cover and species richness than natural wetlands. Both wetland types had similar numbers of exotic species at the whole wetland (4.4 species per wetland) and quadrat scale (1.5 species m(2)) and dominance of exotics increased with elevation. The lower species richness greater compositional variability and lack of a distinctive flora support the hypothesis that dispersal limitation is the primary cause of the differences between the vegetation in restored and natural wetlands. 207:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,217:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,236:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,238:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Natural history as we have known it is in decline. A growing movement is emerging across disciplines to understand its decline and nurture its rebirth. A network of like minded scientists resource managers educators writers and artists natural historians recently convened four consecutive Natural History Initiative workshops to move past the forensic study of natural history and instead focus on solutions conspiring to identify opportunities that dovetail the practice of natural history with essential needs of modern science and society and suggest ways forward. This series of workshops occurred at various locations in the western United States during the winter and spring of 2011 and recently culminated in a Summit on 20 24 June 2011. 244:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,244:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Successful biocomplexity research requires asking hard and important yet answerable questions and finding the appropriate people tools and scales to answer each question that we decide we need to answer. This strategy requires open minds and significant investments of time in talking to people from other disciplines who may have innovative approaches to solving what may be an old problem in a particular discipline. The case studies described in this article demonstrate what we may be able to accomplish by pursuing collaborative interdisciplinary research at appropriate scales with a diversity of tools. One clear message from all three examples is the importance of people who are willing to work together to meet a common goal; in many cases this will require that all team members learn the languages of the component disciplines particularly as those disciplines become more and more different as has been the case with the natural and social sciences. Individual examples also highlight the importance of the tools that different people bring to the team and the ways in which different scales can be used to address different components of a research problem. Clearly the research teams highlighted here are pursuing tough questions in innovative ways and they are getting promising results. These projects demonstrate that a focus on biocomplexity presents an exciting opportunity to make progress toward understanding how nature works and improving our ability to solve environmental problems.  245:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Back off man Im a scientist. Ive been haunted by this bumper sticker for many years. Im a scientist. I love what I do. Doing science is fun. When I first saw this slogan it bothered me because I thought it sent a false message concerning the arrogance of scientists if people really knew what we did they wouldnt think we were so removed from the mainstream; theyd see a more humane and less objective and cold side to science. Now Im not so sure. Science supposedly tells us why things are the way they are. However numerous prejudices are embedded in scientific training and thinking and science isnt value free. Like other humans scientists have agendas personal social economic and political. Historically scientists were placed on pedestals by nonscientists (and by scientists themselves). People who questioned science were anti intellectual perhaps Luddites and summarily dismissed. After all scientists continually discover innumerable ways to make our lives longer and presumably better. Indeed science has chalked up numerous successes. But I think it can do better especially in our attempts to learn about nature other animals floral communities inanimate environs and the complex interactions among them. Whereas weve certainly learned much about nature traditional reductionistic science often falls short because it fragments the world. Reductionistic science disembodies and dissects wholes into parts. What results are views of the universe in which dynamic multidimensional interactions are presented as static dimensionless flatlands. Our understanding of dynamic variegated landscapes is thwarted because we arent very good at reassembling wholes at reconstructing Humpty Dumpty. We often discover that wholes are greater than the sum of their parts and were unable to understand how whole systems emerge from complex interdependent interactions among their constituents. Laudably the National Science Foundation now supports an interdisciplinary program in biocomplexity. Macroecology is an excellent example of large scale holistic thinking. I believe holistic and heart driven science is needed deep science that is impregnated with spirit and compassion. Holistic heartfelt science reinforces a sense of togetherness in which the seer and seen are one. It fosters the development of deep and reciprocal relationships among humans other animals and other nature softening our tendencies to control and manage almost everything in sight. We must be careful when we try to redecorate nature. In March 2000 the Human Nature Boundaries Group met at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis to discuss what a new holistic science framework might look like one that acknowledges the full spectrum of human nature interrelationships and effects the true integration of human and natural sciences at fundamental levels. To make science more attractive to students creative passionate and bold dreaming needs to be reinforced in the scientific arena. Narrow claims that there is only one way to do good science need to be resisted. Allowing individual idiosyncrasies and visions interdisciplinary collaborations holism feeling and heart to inspire science will make it more exciting and far more likely to be successful. Heed the advice of the Nobel Prize winning geneticist Barbara McClintock. McClintock stressed that scientists should have a feeling for the organism with which they work and she worked with corn! Nowadays more people including scientists question science. Many feel that science hasnt delivered and that scientists are too arrogant. But scientists do make errors and its our fallibility that keeps science afloat. Increasingly science is seen not as a self justifying activity but as another institution whose claims on the public treasury must be defended. Questioning science and deepening and broadening its scope are healthy moves toward a world in which magnificent nature her deep and rich sensuality her beneficence her complexity will be respected cherished and loved. As a result we will resonate more as a friend and less as a foe as we reconcile with the dazzling natural world of which were an integral part. 251:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecology must modernize itself in order to remain relevant in a rapidly shifting landscape. This message was resoundingly clear at a session entitled __Growing Pains: Taking Ecology into the 21st Century __ held at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America last year. A standing room only crowd of approximately 500 scientists filled the room; the conference Twitter feed was dominated by reports from the session and questions from the long line of interested attendees which spilled out into the hallway. The message taken away by the attendees could have been dim and lamenting; instead it was charged with optimism. Four specific areas of tension emerged across the speakers diverse topics: the science ghetto__ our working relationships must be expanded to include nontraditional partners from corporations to citizen scientists; sterile communications__ a diversity of communication skills is critical; a homogenous workforce__the workforce should reflect the diversity of society; and orphan data__data must be treated as a firstclass product of research. Inspired by the sessions thoughtful presentations we propose a more general theme: These four issues all point to the need to dramatically reduce the insularity of our culture which has historically been dominated by academia. Anachronistic incentive structures and practices that do not sufficiently engage other disciplines and sectors of society are hurting our capacity to maintain relevance in a fast moving multicultural and highly connected society. 252:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,253:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,253:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Interdisciplinary collaborations are increasingly common in many areas of science but particularly in fields involved with environmental problems. This is because problems related to human interactions with the environment typically contain numerous parameters reflect extensive human alterations of ecosystems require understanding of physical biological interactions at multiple spatial and temporal scales and involve economic and social capital. Distilling useful scientific information in collaborative interactions is a challenge as is the transfer of this information to others including scientists stakeholders resource managers policymakers and the public. While this problem has been recognized by historians and philosophers of science it has rarely been recognized and openly discussed by scientists themselves. The participation of individuals from a diverse set of scientific disciplines has the potential to enhance the success of problem solving. However obstacles often arise in collaborative efforts for several well known reasons. First it is often difficult to find a common language because of disciplinary specialization. Second existing scientific knowledge (theories models etc.) may reflect a historical scientific and sociopolitical context that may make it ill suited to address current environmental problems and questions. Third collaborations involving multiple disciplines may create difficulties owing to mismatches in space and time scales in forms of knowledge  qualitative versus quantitative) and in levels of precision and accuracy. Fourth scientists are partly conditioned by nonscientific values. A social fabric may dictate scientists worldviews lead them to favor certain assumptions over others and underlie the way they study ecosystems. In this article we argue that the success of interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists can be increased by adopting a formal methodology that considers the structure of knowledge in cooperating disciplines. For our purposes the structure of knowledge comprises five categories of information: disciplinary history and attendant forms of available scientific knowledge; spatial and temporal scales at which that knowledge applies; precision  qualitative versus quantitative nature of understanding across different scales); accuracy of predictions; and availability of data to construct calibrate and test predictive models. By definition therefore evaluating a structure of knowledge reveals limitations in scientific understanding such as what knowledge is lacking or what temporal or spatial scale mismatches exist among disciplines. The epistemological exercise of defining knowledge structures at the onset of a collaborative exercise can be used to construct solvable problems: that is questions that can be answered within defined limits of precision and certainty. This requires building consensus among team members including scientists resource managers and other stakeholders regarding precision  quantitative versus qualitative understanding) dimensional scales of analysis and what disciplines to include in an analysis. Based on this foundation questions that were formulated before the analysis of knowledge structures may need to be modified or rejected. Finally we recommend including the analysis of knowledge structures as a transparent and integral part of a scientific analysis and report. We illustrate the analysis of disciplinary knowledge structures using the general topic of land use impacts on riverine ecosystems. This analysis involves the disciplines of surface water hydrology fluvial geomorphology and riverine ecology because all these disciplines are necessary to the study of riverine ecosystems and because they have diverse histories. In practice problem solving teams may require additional disciplines. 262:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A focus on ecosystem services (ES) is seen as a means for improving decisionmaking. In the research to date the valuation of the material contributions of ecosystems to human well being has been emphasized with less attention to important cultural ES and nonmaterial values. This gap persists because there is no commonly accepted framework for eliciting less tangible values characterizing their changes and including them alongside other services in decisionmaking. Here we develop such a framework for ES research and practice addressing three challenges: (1) Nonmaterial values are ill suited to characterization using monetary methods; (2) it is difficult to unequivocally link particular changes in socioecological systems to particular changes in cultural benefits; and (3) cultural benefits are associated with many services not just cultural ES. There is no magic bullet but our framework may facilitate fuller and more socially acceptable integrations of ES information into planning and management. 264:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,270:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Graduate programs have placed an increasing emphasis on the importance of interdisciplinary education but barriers to interdisciplinary training still remain. We present a new model for interdisciplinary cross institution graduate teaching that combines the best of local teaching distance learning and experiential learning to provide students and faculty with a unique collaborative learning experience and interdisciplinary research skills. We summarize the lessons learned from a highly successful implementation of this course model in the new field of landscape genetics which integrates concepts and methods from population genetics landscape ecology and spatial statistics. The distributed nature of the course allowed sections to be offered locally that would not have been offered otherwise because of the lack of complementary expertise at local institutions. Students gained hands on experience in interdisciplinary Web based and international research collaboration with group projects. A final synthesis meeting was invaluable for course assessment manuscript development for group projects and professional networking. 272:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large scale landscape level restoration actions are widely implemented but receive little attention from academic ecologists. We review the methods used to assess the role of these processes in past studies and suggest ways to use past and ongoing restoration activities to increase our understanding of large scale processes and improve restoration projects. To make better use of past restoration we recommend the use of a number of alternative analytical approaches that have become widely applied in conservation biology and wildlife management but have yet to be adopted in restoration ecology. 276:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,285:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article outlines an approach based on ecosystem services for assessing the trade offs inherent in managing humans embedded in ecological systems. Evaluating these trade offs requires an understanding of the biophysical magnitudes of the changes in ecosystem services that result from human actions and of the impact of these changes on human welfare. We summarize the state of the art of ecosystem services based management and the information needs for applying it. Three case studies of Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites coastal urban and agricultural illustrate the usefulness information needs quantification possibilities and methods for this approach. One example of the application of this approach with rigorously established service changes and valuations taken front the literature is used to illustrate the potential for full economic valuation of several agricultural landscape management options including managing for water quality biodiversity and crop productivity. 286:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding environmental complexity and other dimensions of ecological systems necessitates a holistic approach that can be achieved only by identifying retrieving and synthesizing diverse data from distributed sources; by collaborating with other scientists from a broad range of disciplines; and by investigating many different systems. Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) is developing new software tools to advance ecological understanding through discovery access retrieval and management of distributed and heterogeneous ecological and environmental data. To address the need for cultural change in ecologists and other environmental scientists and to promote collaborative and synthetic approaches KNB and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis are training a cadre of young investigators in techniques for the management and analysis of ecological data with emphasis on multiscale integration and synthesis. 289:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,290:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To truly understand the current status of tropical diversity and to forecast future trends we need to increase emphasis on the study of biodiversity in rural landscapes that are actively managed or modified by people. We present an integrated landscape approach to promote research in human modified landscapes that includes the effects of landscape structure and dynamics on conservation of biodiversity provision of ecosystem services and sustainability of rural livelihoods. We propose research priorities encompassing three major areas: biodiversity human environment interactions and restoration ecology. We highlight key areas where we lack knowledge and where additional understanding is most urgent for promoting conservation and sustaining rural livelihoods. Finally we recommend participatory and multidisciplinary approaches in research and management.

Such interactions are ubiquitous yet changes in LULC are generally made without regard to their biophysical implications. This review considers the potential for LULC to compound confound or even contradict changes expected from climate change alone. These properties give LULC the potential to be used as powerful tools capable of modifying local climate and contributing significantly to the net impact of climate change. Management practices based modifications of LULC patterns and processes could be applied strategically to increase the resilience of vulnerable ecological systems and facilitate climate adaptation. These interventions build on the traditional competencies of land management and land protection organizations and suggest that these institutions have a central role in determining the ecological impact of climate change and the development of strategies for adaptation. The practical limits to the use of LULC based tools also suggest important inflection points between manageable and dangerous levels of climate change. 361:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,362:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,366:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Philippines adopts a highly decentralized approach to coastal management. Each municipal authority exercises management powers and responsibilities over their 15 km municipal waters. Nevertheless in some areas like Southeast Cebu in Central Philippines coastal resource management practices of a single municipality have been working toward scaling up the geographic scope to achieve the desired results of ecosystem based management by expanding from a single municipality to a much broader collaboration at the intermunicipal scale. Such cooperative undertakings focus on activities that jointly address the major resource threats in each of the municipal jurisdictions such as degradation of key coastal habitats overfishing and dwindling fish stocks. This article presents the management strategies outcomes and lessons of an intermunicipal collaboration that is starting to work and shows that local governance systems can be expanded to address the conservation needs of a broader ecosystem and scale. 368:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article examines the current status of management in the Benguela Current Large Marine ecosystem and the three coastal states in which it occurs: Angola Namibia and South Africa. The three countries have all focused on conventional approaches to fisheries management concentrating on target species and management has been largely centrally controlled. They have nevertheless made some progress toward addressing wider ecosystem issues. Scientific capacity has been generally good and scientific advice plays an important role in management decisions although the management capability varies between the countries. All have sufficient capability for ensuring sustainable fisheries but there are skills shortages in some areas. Based largely on a recent project to evaluate the feasibility of implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries in the region the article evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the current management approaches and identifies areas of concern. Limitations and threats to capacity particularly in production of scientific advice and in management functions are considered a major problem. 36:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,370:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This overview compares and synthesizes the articles of this theme issue. It highlights that progress has been made toward the goals of marine ecosystem based management (EBM) in tropical regions. Four key findings are presented: (1) Tailoring EBM to specific contexts ultimately determines success. (2) Employment of a wide variety of marine management tools is necessary and complementary to spatial management through marine protected areas (MPAs). (3) Although EBM approaches may be usefully defined using oceanographic and ecological principles the design and implementation of feasible EBM will require at least equal consideration of governance and social conditions. (4) Interest in EBM has grown rapidly; however this approach only improves ocean resource management if sustained by commitments from at least policymakers resource users and donors. Practical program design principles stressing the importance of leadership development awareness raising institutional reform conflict resolution adaptation and evaluation are derived from these case studies and comparative analyses. A suite of empirically based EBM evaluative criteria which can be adapted to local contexts are suggested to fostered learning and progress. 374:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,375:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,375:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To help scientists use new technologies to tackle critical emerging environmental problems researchers set out to create workshops and a virtual seminar that offer problem based instruction.

Conservation actions are ultimately human behaviors and it is vital to understand how social factors  markets cultural beliefs and values laws and policies demographic change) shape human interactions with the environment and choices to exploit or conserve biodiversity. Many conservationists recognize the importance of the social dimensions of conservation problems but anecdotal observations suggest that conservation biologists perceive a gap between the biological and social sciences that limits the effectiveness of conservation action. Casual conversations among biologists frequently include phrases such as: I am not an economist but. . . We understand the biology but the political process remains our biggest challenge or We cannot convey the uncertainty in our findings to decision makers. Acknowledgment of the existence of a gap between natural and social sciences is nothing new; however the recognition and sense of urgency to bridge this gap seems to be growing among biologists policy makers and funders. Opportunities to integrate social science techniques into conservation practice have been promoted by nongovernmental organizations government agencies and academia. Recent editorials in Conservation Biology and the formation of a Social Sciences Working Group by the Society for Conservation Biology suggest that progress is being made. These contributions define the needs and demonstrate tools and strategies but it is also apparent that the goal of a truly interdisciplinary approach to biodiversity conservation has not been realized. We believe there is a lack of information about perceived barriers to effective collaboration between social scientists and conservation biologists. The reasons for the gaps between these disciplines should be carefully considered so that remedial action based on empirical data can be put into effect. In other words yet again an adaptive management approach to problem solving is needed. Relevant data will be gained by studying the population of scientists most relevant to bridging this gap: natural and social scientists interested in biological conservation. 399:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem based management is logistically and politically challenging because ecosystems are inherently complex and management decisions affect a multitude of groups. Coastal ecosystems which lie at the interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems and provide an array of ecosystem services to different groups aptly illustrate these challenges. Successful ecosystem based management of coastal ecosystems requires incorporating scientific information and the knowledge and views of interested parties into the decision making process. Estimating the provision of ecosystem services under alternative management schemes offers a systematic way to incorporate biogeophysical and socioeconomic information and the views of individuals and groups in the policy and management process. Employing ecosystem services as a common language to improve the process of ecosystem based management presents both benefits and difficulties. Benefits include a transparent method for assessing trade offs associated with management alternatives a common set of facts and common currency on which to base negotiations and improved communication among groups with competing interests or differing worldviews. Yet challenges to this approach remain including predicting how human interventions will affect ecosystems how such changes will affect the provision of ecosystem services and how changes in service provision will affect the welfare of different groups in society. In a case study from Puget Sound Washington we illustrate the potential of applying ecosystem services as a common language for ecosystem based management. 405:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,408:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Over the last decade 2 major U.S. commissions on ocean policy and a wide range of independent sources have argued that ocean ecosystems are in a period of crisis and that current policies are inadequate to prevent further ecological damage. These sources have advocated ecosystem based management as an approach to address conservation issues in the oceans but managers remain uncertain as to how to implement ecosystem based approaches in the real world. We argue that the philosophies of Edward F. Ricketts a mid 20th century marine ecologist offer a framework and clear guidance for taking an ecosystem approach to marine conservation. Ricketts philosophies which were grounded in basic observations of natural history espoused building a holistic picture of the natural world including the influence of humans through repeated observation. This approach when applied to conservation grounds management in what is observable in nature encourages early action in the face of uncertainty and supports an adaptive approach to management as new information becomes available. Ricketts philosophy of   breaking through    which focuses on getting beyond crisis and conflict through honest debate of different parties needs (rather than forcing compromise of differing positions) emphasizes the social dimension of natural resource management. New observational technologies long term ecological data sets and especially advances in the social sciences made available since Ricketts time greatly enhance the utility of Ricketts philosophy of marine conservation. 409:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,410:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,432:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,433:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,438:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Since agricultural activities were first recorded there have been shortages of pollinators. Today it seems that pollination systems in many areas of agriculture are threatened by the inadequacy or lack of sustainable managed indigenous or imported pollinators. Pollinator shortages can adversely affect crop production and commodity markets. This paper presents an economic model than can be used. to measure some of the economic impacts of pollinator deficits on traded commodities. This economic analysis indicates that consumers of a commodity affected by a pollinator deficit may suffer because the commodity costs more and becomes less available. At the same time although the producers of the affected commodity may experience crop declines they may also experience economic gains in the form of higher prices. The amount the producer gains or loses depends on the shape of the supply and demand functions and the magnitude of these losses or gains is an empirical question. Although there are few data available to evaluate this model those we do have indicate that serious problems for world food supply security and trade could be in the offing if current declines in pollinator abundance diversity and availability are not reversed. Various crops and cropping systems are suggested as practical starting places for economic studies of the effects of pollinator declines with emphasis on the type of data required. 439:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The benefits and risks of any particular GM crop depend on the interactions of its ecological functions and natural history with the agroecosystem and ecosystems within which it is embedded. These evolutionary and ecological factors must be considered when assessing GM crops. We argue that the assessment of GM crops should be broadened to include alternative agricultural practices ecosystem management and agricultural policy. Such an assessment would be facilitated by a clearer understanding of the indirect costs of agriculture and the ecological services that support it. The benefits of GM crops should be compared to those of other means of agricultural intensification such as organic farming integrated pest management and agricultural policy reform. A gradual and cautious approach to the use of GM crops that relies on a truly comprehensive risk assessment could allow people to reap substantial benefits from GM crops while mitigating their serious risks. 444:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,448:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,449:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,451:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central challenge in conservation is to create value effectively around local resources that will lead to better environmental stewardship. Historically conservationists have either used indirect approaches such as the promotion of alternate industries like eco tourism or more recently direct approaches such as land purchases and cash payments. While direct payment programs through conservation incentive agreements and regular payments for ecosystem preservation are being trialed in low income nations the lack of enforceable property rights and contractual laws can present challenges when trying to influence conservation outcomes in local communities. We suggest an alternative approach debt based investment that capitalizes environmental assets locally and makes that capital available to local communities through collateralized lending microfinance approaches and access to affordable financial services. Tying the value of capital in a conservation lending trust to the global value for intact environmental resources will create incentives for local environmental stewardship while providing economic access to what is often a poor communitys most valuable asset intact natural resources. 452:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,452:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coastal marine ecosystems rank among the most productive ecosystems on earth but are also highly threatened by the exposure to both ocean and land based human activities. Spatially explicit information on the distributions of land based impacts is critical for managers to identify where the effects of land based activities on ecosystem condition are greatest and therefore where they should prioritize mitigation of land based impacts. Here we quantify the global cumulative impact of four of the most pervasive land based impacts on coastal ecosystems nutrient input organic and inorganic pollution and the direct impact of coastal populations (e. g. coastal engineering and trampling) and identify hotspots of land based impact using a variety of metrics. These threat hotspots were primarily in Europe and Asia with the top three adjacent to the Mississippi Ganges and Mekong rivers. We found that 95 PeRcEnT of coastal and shelf areas ( 200 m depth) and 40 PeRcEnT of the global coastline experience little to no impact from land based human activities suggesting that marine conservation and resource management in these areas can focus on managing current ocean activities and preventing future spread of land based stressors. These results provide guidance on where coordination between marine and terrestrial management is most critical and where a focus on ocean based impacts is instead needed. 455:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,457:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article discusses the appeal to infinite value in environmental decision making. We argue that invoking infinite values as a means of faithfully representing the worth of certain parts of the natural environment is a mistake. Infinite values have a number of theoretical and practical problems associated with them. For example we show that invoking infinite values makes it hard to motivate conservation management decisions with greater probability of success. It is also difficult to motivate decisions that lead to better environmental outcomes such as an increase in the area of habitat preserved. The upshot is that environmental decision making would be crippled if infinite values were introduced. 468:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge (SEEK) is designed to help ecologists overcome data integration and synthesis challenges. The SEEK environment enables ecologists to efficiently capture organize and search for data and analytical processes. We describe SEEK and discuss how it can benefit ecological niche modeling in which biodiversity scientists require access and integration of regional and global data as well as significant analytical resources. SEEK is designed as a three layer architecture. The EcoGrid forms the base layer and provides a uniform and simple programming interface for access to distributed resources such as data metadata and workflows. The KEPLER Scientific Workflow System forms the topmost layer and provides tools that allow scientists to create and compose scientific workflows  analytical models) execute them and archive the results. KEPLER makes extensive use of EcoGrid interfaces. For instance through the EcoGrid KEPLER allows scientists to search for and retrieve data and workflows stored across distributed repositories. The Semantic Mediation System (SMS) forms the middle layer of the architecture and mediates between heterogeneous resources in the EcoGrid and the analyses and models to be executed in KEPLER. SMS leverages ontologies to facilitate data integration and workflow composition thereby increasing the scale and complexity of analyses that can be constructed and executed by scientists. Each of these layers is described further below. The EcoGrid layer forms the underlying cyberinfrastructure within SEEK for enabling remote data and service discovery data sharing and access and remote service invocation. EcoGrid services and interfaces are being built using best practices currently available in grid technology  OGSA WSRF SRB and Condor). EcoGrid provides resource discovery through a registration service. Many data sets accessible through the EcoGrid have Ecological Metadata Language (EML) descriptions that are also used for data discovery access and integration. KEPLER is used to design and execute scientific workflows. KEPLER includes components (called actors) to access data from the EcoGrid as well as other generic scientific workflow components including R and Matlab modules for statistical analysis. From these components customized scientific workflows can be built such as the Genetic Algorithm for Ruleset Production (GARP) discussed below. Existing components and workflows can be linked within KEPLER to form a new scientific workflow graph. The inputs and outputs of components are represented using ports which can have structural types describing the physical representation of data  double) as well as semantic types describing the conceptual meaning and scientific context of data  BODYSIZE). The SMS system uses structural and semantic types to help scientists construct meaningful scientific workflows. The SMS layer provides ontology based services to KEPLER including support for data integration workflow composition and concept based searching. The SEEK Knowledge Representation Team (KR) includes ecologists and knowledge engineers who jointly develop and maintain formal ontologies to be used by the SMS. These ontologies cover a number of different areas including measurement time and space basic ecological concepts biodiversity and unit systems. Also as part of KR SMS the SEEK Taxonomic Object Service 5 is being developed to help resolve progressive changes of taxonomic names to sets of taxonomic concepts providing well defined authoritative and (ideally) unambiguous information about the identification of organisms. 472:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,473:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,479:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,483:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,489:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,495:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,501:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,506:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,509:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,518:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,521:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,522:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,526:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Flood control levees are generally thought to increase flood height and velocity for a given discharge. While extensive areas of floodplain in the United States are leveed the ecological impacts of levees have largely been ignored relative to other anthropogenic impacts to large river floodplains. We examined a century of flood control along the Wisconsin River by comparing simulated flood regimes under   levee   and   levee removal   scenarios. We also used field sampling to determine if levees had altered the distribution of dominant floodplain forest trees. Increases in flood stage (height) due to levees were minor only a few centimeters. This was primarily due to the location of the levees set back hundreds of meters into the floodplain in some areas. Increases in overbank flood velocities due to levees were minimal compared to increases caused by channel constriction and by increased flood magnitude. Generally levees had a greater impact on stage and overbank flood velocities of larger magnitude events. The mean number of floods and number of days flooded were lower in areas outside (on upland sides) of levees and stream power was zero in these areas due to a lack of any inundation. These areas also had lower importance values (IV) for several flood tolerant tree species (Acer saccharinum and Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and higher IVs for some flood intolerant species (Quercus velutina and Q. ellipsoidalis). Furthermore areas inside levees (between the levee land the channel) were no different from completely unleveed areas in the number of floods number of days flooded and in INS of several dominant tree species. The levee location (set back into the floodplain) resulted in a similar historic flood regime and thus similar abundances of floodplain tree species in areas inside levees as compared to completely unleveed areas. Setback levees can provide an important compromise by maintaining the relative abundance of tree species normally found in unleveed areas while also allowing some flood control. Floodplain restoration involving levee removal should generally target the removal of mainline levees (those adjacent to the channel) rather than removal of setback levees. 531:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,533:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,535:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,537:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,546:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Natural ecosystems benefit human communities by providing ecosystem services such as water purification and crop pollination. Mapping ecosystem service values has become popular but most are static snapshots of average value. Estimating instead the economic impacts of specific ecosystem changes can better inform typical resource decisions. Here we develop an approach to mapping marginal values those resulting from the next unit of ecosystem change across landscapes. We demonstrate the approach with a recent model of crop pollination services in Costa Rica simulating deforestation events to predict resulting marginal changes in pollination services to coffee farms. We find that marginal losses from deforestation vary from zero to US DoLlQuAnT 700 ha across the landscape. Financial risks for farmers from these losses and marginal benefits of forest restoration show similar spatial variation. Marginal values are concentrated in relatively few forest parcels not identified using average value. These parcels lack substitutes: nearby forest parcels that can supply services in the event of loss. Indeed the marginal value of forest parcels declines exponentially with the density of surrounding forest cover. The approach we develop is applicable to any ecosystem service. Combined with information on costs it can help target conservation or restoration efforts to optimize benefits to people and biodiversity. 547:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nearly all large rivers and their floodplains in the Northern Hemisphere are subject to multiple disturbances such as levees impoundments channelization dams and chances in land use. Isolating the relative impact of different disturbances is difficult when the combined effects are nonadditive. I developed a   neutral terrain model   to examine the cumulative impacts of levees and dams on the hydroperiod of ponds and wetlands that form throughout floodplains after flood events. Using simulated floods of different magnitude I address two major questions: (1) What is the relative influence of levees vs. dams on the duration and abundance of temporary ponds and wetlands? (2) Are the cumulative effects of levees and dams additive synergistic or antagonistic? Levees decreased the area occupied by temporary ponds (as compared to the natural scenario) until the levee was breached by large magnitude events. When the levee was breached no differences were found between the natural and levee floodplain scenarios. A simulated upstream dam decreased increased or had no effect on the area occupied by temporary ponds depending on flood magnitude. Synergistic interactions between levees and dams were apparent for larger floods where the reduction in flood stage caused by an upstream dam prevented levee breaching. Lastly I introduce a qualitative framework for understanding the impacts of levees and dams on the duration of floodplain ponds. I also discuss the applications of this new three dimensional simulation modeling technique neutral terrain modeling as a tool for addressing spatial aspects of watershed and floodplain questions. 549:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,556:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) postulates that environmental quality is initially degraded with increasing economic prosperity until reaching some turning point where environmental quality improves with increases in wealth. Tests using environmental indicators beyond those that affect human health have been less supportive of the EKC idea. We hypothesize that environmental changes impacting human health are more likely to show evidence of an EKC than variables less directly related to human health. Furthermore the EKC hypothesis assumes that ecological damage is reversible and we argue that this assumption is not always valid. We test for evidence of an EKC in Dane County Wisconsin using non point source pollution time series data for Lake Mendota throughout the 20th century. We examine metals deposited in lake sediments (cadmium chromium copper and lead) other non point source pollutants such as sulfur and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and water clarity (measured by Secchi disk depth). We relate changes in ecological variables to changes in real wealth per capita (RWPC) in Dane County over time. The EKC did not describe the relationship between all ecological and economic indicators tested; however several variables were related to RWPC. Our strongest results (for Secchi depth DRP and copper) show increasing pollution with increasing wealth. Secchi depth and DRP are related to water quality and clarity which have value to society but less direct immediate health consequences. P pollution may also be fairly irreversible over short time scales. The best models and plots for cadmium chromium and lead suggest improvements in environmental quality with increases in RWPC although these trends were not statistically significant. Results for sulfur were inconclusive. Overall wealth did not explain much of the Variability in any of the ecological variables examined here suggesting that consideration of additional factors are necessary to explain their dynamics. Economic prosperity cannot be expected to improve all aspects of the environment but may be biased toward aspects that are ecologically reversible phenomena or of concern to human health. 558:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,567:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,56:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,572:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,573:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,575:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,582:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, How do we develop meaningful indicators of them? This is an important problem that has been hidden by the elegance and availability of other aggregate measures designed to address the completely different problem of measuring human production and accounting income. Why would one want to measure the aggregate value of ecosystem services whether at local regional national or global scales? This is a reasonable and necessary exercise to the extent that human welfare depends on whether these services improve or deteriorate. We may have more houses but if that means we have fewer trees and less viable forests something is seriously wrong with an accounting system that only adds up houses and presumes that this is a full measure of welfare change. It is also necessary in order to address the question of what is the optimum scale or size of the economy relative to the ecological life support system. To address this question one must be able to directly compare the value of ecosystem services lost with the value of other economic services gained something that other methods to assess the importance of ecosystem services  the ecological footprint for all their heuristic value cannot do. The purpose of our global valuation exercise was simply to begin the exercise of measuring the aggregate value of ecosystem services. The results illustrated that even using admittedly narrow and imperfect conventional economic methods the aggregate value of these services was in the same order of magnitude as global GNP. We freely admitted the studys many shortcomings including (a) it assumed too much homogeneity in natural capital forms and economic contexts; (b) it was partial and static rather than general equilibrium and dynamic; and (c) the studies from which the shadow values were taken differed widely in their theoretical and practical relevance. Far from invalidating the results however these shortcomings merely beg for further attention to the question. It is a well accepted method in science to make an initial first approximation to a complex problem and allow the results to determine whether it is worth investing the effort to do more elaborate studies. The study also raised other questions as pointed out in the commentaries in this forum (and elsewhere). Below we briefly address some of the major (or at least most frequent) of these. 583:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,583:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This special issue represents the output of a 3 year working group supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) plus a few additional contributions. The papers cover conceptual empirical and modeling issues concerning the dynamics and valuation of ecosystem services. They include discussions of the nature of value the dynamics of complex adaptive systems links between fairness and valuation and global estimates of the value of ecosystem services using various models and databases. Taken together they represent a unique set of perspectives and a unique synthesis of the valuation issue. They provide fresh answers to some long standing questions and in the process raise new and interesting questions about valuing ecosystem services. 584:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A value of ecosystem services (VES) may be calculated by multiplying a set of ecosystem services by a set of corresponding shadow prices. This paper examines the role of the VES concept in measuring trends in human wellbeing. Under conventional arguments from applied welfare economics standard measures of market consumption may be extended to include the value of direct environmental services which affect welfare in ways that are not mediated by the consumption of purchased goods. The VES concept does not capture values such as ecological sustainability and distributional fairness that are not reducible to individual welfare. And its operationalization is constrained by the well known limitations of nonmarket valuation methods. Nonetheless attempts to calculate the value of environmental services can provide insights into the tradeoffs between market activity and environmental quality that are implicit in the process of economic growth. Such efforts can promote informed debate concerning the achievement of sustainable development. 586:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An increasing amount of information is being collected on the ecological and socio economic value of goods and services provided by natural and semi natural ecosystems. However much of this information appears scattered throughout a disciplinary academic literature unpublished government agency reports and across the World Wide Web. In addition data on ecosystem goods and services often appears at incompatible scales of analysis and is classified differently by different authors. In order to make comparative ecological economic analysis possible a standardized framework for the comprehensive assessment of ecosystem functions goods and services is needed. In response to this challenge this paper presents a conceptual framework and typology for describing classifying and valuing ecosystem functions goods and services in a clear and consistent manner. In the following analysis a classification is given for the fullest possible range of 23 ecosystem functions that provide a much larger number of goods and services. In the second part of the paper a checklist and matrix is provided linking these ecosystem functions to the main ecological socio cultural and economic valuation methods. 587:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,587:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Discourse based methods involving small groups of citizens have yet to be thoroughly engaged in the practice of ecosystem valuation. This remains true despite the fact that many ecosystem goods and services such as clean air biodiversity and unpolluted lakes and rivers are considered to be public goods. The conventional application of ecosystem valuation relies heavily on methodologies such as contingent valuation in which individuals are asked to express the value they attach to ecosystem goods and services in social isolation. The difference between the public nature of ecosystem services and their valuation through individual expression has thus recently led to calls for more deliberative forms of environmental valuation. Because the allocation of ecosystem services directly affects many people and raises normative questions about social equity it is argued that carefully designed discursive methods will help ensure the achievement of social equity goals. In this paper we examine the theoretical and normative assumptions that rest beneath the proposed turn towards discourse based methods and identify procedures for testing their application in the field. 588:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,588:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological and economic systems are undeniably complex. Whereas a goal of delineating ecosystem services is to make readily apparent some of the important ways in which ecosystems underpin human welfare insights are also gained by appreciating the nonlinear dynamic properties of ecosystems. In this paper we review some of the relevant characteristics of complex systems. Ecosystems and economic systems share many properties but valuation has typically been driven by short term human preferences. Here we argue that as the force of humanity increases on the planet ecosystem service valuation will need to switch from choosing among resources to valuing the avoidance of catastrophic ecosystem change. 589:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological pricing theory and method is reviewed and then applied to the valuation of biosphere processes and services. Ecological pricing values biosphere processes on the basis of biophysical interdependencies between all parts of the ecosystem not just those that have direct or obvious value to humans. The application of the ecological pricing method to the biosphere for 1994 indicates that the total value of primary ecological inputs (services) to be nearly  DoLlQuAnT 25 trillion. This compares with  DoLlQuAnT 33 trillion obtained in the Costanza . (1997) study. Our analysis also indicated a good correspondence between the shadow ecological price and the observed market price for all marketable goods except fossil fuel which was undervalued by the market. 590:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem service approaches have become a prominent basis for planning and management. Cultural services and non use values are included in all major typologies and present some of the most compelling reasons for conserving ecosystems though many barriers exist to their explicit characterization. The values that conform least well to economic assumptions variously lumped together with as cultural services have proven elusive in part because valuation is complicated by the properties of intangibility and incommensurability which has in turn led to their exclusion from economic valuation. We argue that the effectiveness of the ecosystem services framework in decision making is thwarted by (i) conflation of services values and benefits and (ii) failure to appropriately treat diverse kinds of values. We address this challenge by (1) distinguishing eight dimensions of values which have implications for appropriate valuation and decision making; (2) demonstrating the interconnected nature of benefits and services and so the ubiquity of intangible values: (3) discussing the implications of these propositions for ecosystem services research; and (4) outlining briefly a research agenda to enable decision making that is ecologically appropriate and socially just. Because many ecosystem services (co )produce cultural benefits full characterization of services must address non material values through methods from diverse social sciences. . 592:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Monetary values and biophysical features tend to dominate spatial planning data yet intangible cultural values have a large role to play in decision making. If left implicit such considerations may be represented poorly in planning. To foster explicit inclusion of intangible values alongside material values connected to ecosystems we elicited verbal articulation spatial identification and quantified marine related values and threats across the seascape of northem Vancouver Island Canada. We address: (1) how do our spatial interviews involving maps and semi structured interviews enable and or impede the elicitation of intangible values? (2) What categories of ecosystem benefits do participants identify as most important? (3) Are spatial distributions of monetary values correlated with non monetary values and threats? Our findings indicate that (1) while maps were provocative sizable minorities of interviewees refused to assign different numerical non monetary values to specific locations (30 PeRcEnT) or refused to identify locations of non monetary importance (16 PeRcEnT); (2) people allocated the highest non monetary values to places notable for wildlife outdoor recreation then cultural heritage; and (3) significant pair wise overlap occurred but also sizable deviations among monetary non monetary and threat distributions. Despite limitations to representing non monetary values spatially and quantitatively these methods offer a straightforward approach to catalog and map ecosystem services to inform spatial planning. . 593:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Protecting tropical forests under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could reduce the cost of emissions limitations set in Kyoto. However while society must soon decide whether or not to use tropical forest based offsets evidence regarding tropical carbon sinks is sparse. This paper presents a general method for constructing an integrated model (based on detailed historical remote sensing and field data) that can produce land use and carbon baselines predict carbon sequestration supply to a carbon offsets market and also help to evaluate optimal market rules. Creating such integrated models requires close collaboration between social and natural scientists. Our project combines varied disciplinary expertise (in economics ecology and geography) with local knowledge in order to create high quality empirically grounded integrated models for Costa Rica. 594:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantifying the value of ecosystem services is important for the social recognition and acceptance of ecosystem management across multiple geographic scales. Yet the data required to perform such quantifications and the dynamic models that allow the projection of policy changes into the future are currently scattered incomplete and difficult to use. We describe the design of the Ecosystem Services Database (ESD) an integrated web accessible knowledge base that links a relational database for temporally and spatially explicit data to dynamic simulation models. The ESD architecture supports unit standardization scale translation in space and time and statistical analysis. Process based dynamic models and valuation methods can be run by end users either through a web based simulation engine or on their own computers by means of open source software. The knowledge base will serve as: (1) a communication tool for use by researchers in several fields; (2) an analytical tool for meta analysis synthesis and prediction; (3) an educational tool to disseminate knowledge on ecosystem services and their valuation; (4) a collaborative tool for institutions involved in different aspects of ecosystem service valuation; and (5) a prototype for linking databases and dynamic models. 595:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The biosphere is increasingly dominated by human action. Consequently ecology must incorporate human behavior. Political ecology as long as it includes ecology is a powerful framework for integrating natural and social dynamics. In this paper I present a resilience oriented approach to political ecology that integrates system dynamics scale and cross scale interactions in both human and natural systems. This approach suggests that understanding the coupled dynamics of human ecological systems allows the assessment of when systems are most vulnerable and most open to transformation. I use this framework to examine the political ecology of salmon in the Columbia River Basin. 596:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The oceans have long been recognized as one of humanitys most important natural resources. Their vastness has made them appear to be limitless sources of food transportation recreation and awe. The difficulty of fencing and policing them has left them largely as open access resources to be exploited by anyone with the means. However in recent times we have begun to reach the limits of the oceans and must now begin to utilize and govern them in a more sustainable way. This paper summarizes emerging information on the interrelated ecological economic and social importance of the oceans and on developing institutions for their sustainable governance. In addition to their traditional importance as sources of primary and secondary production and biodiversiy the importance of the oceans in global material and energy cycles is now beginning to be better appreciated. Integrated models of the global ocean atmosphere terrestrial biosphere system reveal the critical role of the oceans in atmospheric gas and climate regulation and for water nutrient and waste cycling. Recent estimates of the economic value of the marketed and non marketed ecosystem services of the oceans indicate a huge contribution to human welfare from the functions mentioned above plus raw materials recreational and cultural services. The oceans have been estimated to contribute a total of similar to 21 trillion US$ year to human welfare (compared with a global GNP of similar to 25 trillion US$) with similar to 60 PeRcEnT of this from coastal and shelf systems and the other 40 PeRcEnT from the open ocean. and with the oceans contributing similar to 60 PeRcEnT of the total economic value of the biosphere (Costanza . 1997. The value of the worlds ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387 253 260). The social importance of the oceans for global transportation and as a unifying element in the cultures of many coastal countries cannot be overestimated. However the cultural traditions of open access must be replaced with more appropriate property rights regimes and governance structures. Some alternative sustainable governance ideas are briefly discussed emphasizing the need for an expanded deliberative process to develop a shared vision of a sustainable use of oceans. 597:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,597:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The purpose of this special issue is to elucidate concepts of value and methods of valuation that will assist in guiding human decisions vis a vis ecosystems. The concept of ecosystem service value can be a useful guide when distinguishing and measuring where trade offs between society and the rest of nature are possible and where they can be made to enhance human welfare in a sustainable manner. While win win opportunities for human activities within the environment may exist they also appear to be increasingly scarce in a full global ecological economic system. This makes valuation all the more essential for guiding future human activity. This paper provides some history background and context for many of the issues addressed by the remaining papers in this special issue. Its purpose is to place both economic and ecological meanings of value and their respective valuation methods in a comparative context highlighting strengths weakness and addressing questions that arise from their integration. 598:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The purpose of this study is to determine how the spatial scale of measurement influences ecosystem service valuation. Two land cover datasets were compared: one classified from 1 km imagery and one classified from 30 m imagery. The coarse resolution biome dataset used in this study (called the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) Dataset) was classified from 1 km NOAA AVHRR imagery and includes 17 biome types. The finer resolution National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) used in this study was classified from 30 m Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and has 21 land cover classes. A common land cover classification scheme containing eight land cover types was developed in order to compare the two datasets. The areal extent of these land cover types in each dataset was determined and then multiplied by the value of the ecosystem services to arrive at a total value for ecosystem services. Generally the areal extent of Lakes Rivers barren areas urban areas and wetlands in the NLCD showed the largest increases when compared to their extents in the IGBP dataset. The total value of ecosystem services for every state except New Mexico increased using the NLCD. The total value of ecosystem services for the conterminous US increased by almost 200 PeRcEnT. The total value according to the I km resolution IGBP data was 259 billion yr whereas the total value according to the finer resolution (30 m) NLCD data was over  DoLlQuAnT 773 billion yr. Most of the increase in ecosystem service value can be attributed to the increased extent of wetlands in the NLCD. It is also interesting to note that the total value of ecosystem services in the conterminous US is only 8 PeRcEnT of gross domestic product of those states ( DoLlQuAnT 8.6 trillion). These methods use land cover as a proxy measure of ecosystem service. Some of the pitfalls and promise of this assumption are discussed in the context of spatially explicit remotely sensed image data. 599:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We estimated global marketed and non marketed economic value front two classified satellite images with global coverage at 1 km(2) resolution. GDP (a measure of marketed economic output) is correlated with the amount of light energy (LE) emitted by that nation as measured by nighttime satellite images. LE emitted is more spatially explicit than whole country GDP may (for some nations or regions) be a more accurate indicator of economic activity than GDP itself can be directly observed and can be easily updated on an annual basis. As far as we know this is the first global map of estimated economic activity produced at this high spatial resolution (1 km(2)). Ecosystem services product (ESP) is an important type of non marketed value. ESP at 1 km(2) resolution was estimated using the IGBP land cover dataset and unit ecosystem service values estimated by Costanza . Valuing Ecosystem Services with Efficiency Fairness and Sustainability as Goals. Natures Services Island Press Washington DC pp. 49 70 . The sum of these two (GDP ESP) equals SEP is a measure of the subtotal ecological economic product (marketed plus a significant portion of the non marketed). The ratio: (ESP SEP) x 100 equals (PeRcEnT ESP is a measure of proportion of the SEP from ecosystem services. Both SEP and PeRcEnT ESP were calculated and mapped for each 1 km(2) pixel on the earths surface and aggregated by country. Results show the detailed spatial patterns of GDP ESP and SEP (also available at: http: www.du.edu similar to psutton esiindexisee EcolEconESI.htm). Globally while GDP is concentrated in the northern industrialized countries ESP is concentrated in tropical regions and in wetlands and other coastal systems. (X)ESP ranges from 1 PeRcEnT for Belgium and Luxembourg to 3 PeRcEnT for the Netherlands 18 PeRcEnT for India 22 PeRcEnT for the United States 49 PeRcEnT for Costa Rica 57 PeRcEnT for Chile 73 PeRcEnT for Brazil and 92 PeRcEnT for Russia. While GDP per capita has the usual northern industrialized countries at the top of the list SEP per capita shows a quite different picture with a mixture of countries with either high GDP capita high ESP capita or a combination near the top of the list. Finally we compare our results with two other indices: (1) The 2001 Environmental Sustainabilily Index (ESI) derived as an initiative of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow Environment Task Force World Economic Foruin and (2) Ecological Footprints of Nations: How much Nature do they use? How much Nature do they have? developed by Mathis Wackernagel and others. While both of these indices purport to measure sustainability the ESI is actually mainly a measure of economic activity (and is correlated with GDP) while the Eco Footprint index is a measure of environmental impact. The related eco deficit (national ecological capacity minus national footprint) correlates well with PeRcEnT ESP. 605:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Environmental sensor networks are now commonly being deployed within environmental observatories and as components of smaller scale ecological and environmental experiments Effectively using data from these sensor networks presents technical challenges that are difficult for scientists to overcome. severely limiting the adoption of automated sensing technologies in environmental science The Realtime Environment for Analytical Processing (REAP) is an NSF funded project to address the technical challenges related to accessing and using heterogeneous sensor data from within the Kepler scientific workflow system Using distinct use cases in terrestrial ecology and oceanography as motivating examples we describe workflows and extensions to Kepler to stream and analyze data from observatory networks and archives We focus on the use of two newly integrated data Sources in Kepler DataTurbine and OPeNDAP Integrated access to both near real time data streams and data archives from within Kepler facilitates both simple data exploration and sophisticated analysis and modeling with these data sources  607:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,618:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,619:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,621:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,623:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,627:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,629:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,630:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,631:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,63:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,644:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,649:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,653:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,664:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,668:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,671:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,672:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,674:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,677:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,678:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,681:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,682:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,683:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,684:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,77:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,801:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Humanitys ever increasing ability to effect environmental change on a number of spatial and temporal scales requires tough decisions about how we view value and manage ecosystems. For example advances in agriculture that support vastly more people per unit area than hunting and gathering are clearly a positive outcome for society. However many beneficial land use practices including agriculture may ultimately degrade ecosystems. To function as a society some amount of ecosystem alteration must occur to support the human population but we are ultimately dependent on ecosystem services. Our actions both intentionally and unwittingly alter the goods and services of many ecosystems on which we rely and by entering into this relationship of altering ecosystems we incur responsibility to our neighbors and to future generations. However the difficult decisions have largely been avoided by the expectations and confidence in conservation and in particular ecological restoration. Given the widespread alteration of natural systems it is clear that conservation measures alone will not suffice to protect ecosystem functions services and habitat for a large number of species in the future. Conservation has traditionally been a rearguard measure to prevent further degradation rather than a means for increasing resources or natural capital. As such simple maintenance as opposed to enhancement of ecosystems may often leave ecosystems and species vulnerable. Despite conservation policies such as roadless areas and the No Net Loss concept for U.S. wetlands losses continue to exceed gains and gains are often not functionally equivalent to losses. Increasing human population growth and resource consumption continue to place additional stresses on systems and demands more capacity and services rather than simple maintenance of current services. Thus we must either alter consumption or rely on our ability to create restore and enhance ecosystems and their services. Despite our dependence on healthy ecosystems society has made the decision to continue life as usual until a loss of valued goods and services is realized; then society will expect and rely on science to clean up the mess and make it look natural. Many government policies concerning development and extractive resource use already assume the ability to mitigate ecosystem damage through the restoration of degraded land or creation of new habitats. However many restorations are not successful either in structure or function when compared with reference ecosystems. Such results underscore the need to evaluate our underlying beliefs and expectations in restoration. The incredible complexity of nature forces us to simplify the systems we study in order to develop theory and generalities by reducing them to understandable subsets. Although we cannot function without theory and conceptual models their creation often ignores the variability that is so important to accurately describe predict and recreate current and future system attributes. In essence restoration ecology strives to (re )create complex systems from simplified guiding principles or myths. Failure to recognize the limitations and tacit assumptions can lead to failures because of the over application of over simplified concepts to complex systems. We believe the same is true in ecological restoration. We believe that many unsatisfactory restorations result from a failure to recognize and address uncertainty and from a focus on inappropriate time scales. Ecological restoration is trying to do in a matter of years what takes decades or centuries under natural conditions. Expecting complete restoration on human time scales is unreasonable even where full recovery may eventually occur. Nonetheless many of our underlying beliefs tacitly assume that systems will return to a natural state in fairly short order if they are just nudged in the right direction through adjustments to physical attributes or by regulating species composition. Additional problems arise in defining what is natural and in our inability to accept that systems are dynamic and may have multiple trajectories leading to numerous possible outcomes. Finally because we are extrapolating from oversimplified concepts ignoring uncertainty may result in surprise and failure because we have not created a system capable of adapting or responding to future drivers or events. Therefore restorations should not be one time events but are likely to require periodic attention and adaptive management to increase the chances of responsive adaptive and successful projects. Based on our experiences as researchers and practitioners in conservation and restoration ecology we propose five central myths under which many ecological restoration and management projects seem to be conceived and implemented. Myths have value because they help us to organize and understand complex systems and phenomena. Identifying myths can help make the tacit explicit by revealing assumptions that are otherwise hidden. However they remain simplified and potentially misguided models for understanding and application. The first Myth the Carbon Copy addresses the goal setting process and as such it forms the basis of how restorations are evaluated. The Carbon Copy is closely tied to the remaining four myths which involve the process of restoration and management: the Field of Dreams; Fast Forwarding; the Cookbook; and Command and Control: the Sisyphus Complex. We believe that describing these myths will be useful in understanding how some management or restoration strategies are conceived designed and implemented. For example adherence to different myths may direct actions in divergent directions as could be the case when choosing between a focus on ecosystem structure (Carbon Copy) or on key processes (Field of Dreams). Examining these myths may also help us better understand why some restoration projects do not meet our expectations. In the pages below we briefly describe each myth and its assumptions and give examples where the myth exists. Our objective is not to abandon what we propose to be prevalent myths in ecological restoration__there are elements of truth in each__but to recognize that there are tacit assumptions associated with each myth. Failure to recognize these assumptions can lead to conflict and disappointing results despite large expenditures of time and effort. Our challenge is to recognize the limitations and not accept sometimes dogmatic beliefs without critical examination. We do not claim that every project is rooted in myth but suggest that many perceived failures may be traced to over reliance on one or more of the myths. We do not condemn restoration ecology but rather provide a means of self examination so readers can identify from their own experiences what worked and possible reasons for perceived failures. 802:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Complex environmental problem solving depends on cross disciplinary collaboration among scientists. Collaborative research must be preceded by an exploratory phase of collective thinking that creates shared conceptual frameworks. Collective thinking in a cross disciplinary setting depends on the facility with which collaborators are able to learn and understand each others perspectives. This paper applies three perspectives on learning to the problem of enabling cross disciplinary collaboration: Maslows hierarchy of needs constructivism and organizational learning. Application of learning frameworks to collaboration provides insights regarding receptive environments for collaboration and processes that facilitate cross disciplinary interactions. These environments and interactions need time to develop and require a long phase of idea generation preceding any focused research effort. The findings highlight that collaboration is itself a complex system of people scientific theory and tools that must be intentionally managed. Effective management of the system requires leaders who are facilitators and are capable of orchestrating effective environments and interactions. 803:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Humanity faces increasingly intractable environmental problems characterized by high uncertainty complexity and swift change. Natural resource governance must therefore involve continuous production and use of new knowledge to adapt to highly complex rapidly changing social ecological systems to ensure long term sustainable development. Bridging and boundary organizations have been proposed as potentially powerful means of achieving these aims by promoting cooperation among actors from the science policy and management sectors. However despite substantial investments of time capital and human resources little agreement exists about definitions and measures of knowledge production and how this is achieved in bridging organizations and there is only meager understanding of how knowledge production and its use are shaped by social interactions socio political environments and power relations. New concepts methods and metrics for conceptualizing and measuring learning in support of natural resource governance and testing the conditions under which it can be achieved are therefore badly needed. This paper presents an attempt at a holistic framework to address this drawing on theory methods and metrics from three research areas: knowledge utilization boundary organizations and stakeholder theory. Taken together these provide a solid conceptual and methodological toolkit for conducting cross case comparisons aimed at understanding the social environmental conditions under which learning in such organizations does and does not occur. We use empirical data to show how the framework can be applied and discuss some of the practical considerations and important challenges that emerge. We close with a general discussion and an agenda for future research to promote discussion around the topic of how to erect systematic comparisons of learning in support of adaptive natural resource governance as it occurs in bridging organizations. 804:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many contemporary societal challenges manifest themselves in the domain of human environment interactions. There is a growing recognition that responses to these challenges formulated within current disciplinary boundaries in isolation from their wider contexts cannot adequately address them. Here we outline the need for an integrated transdisciplinary synthesis that allows for a holistic approach and above all a much longer time perspective. We outline both the need for and the fundamental characteristics of what we call   integrated history.   This approach promises to yield new understandings of the relationship between the past present and possible futures of our integrated human environment system. We recommend a unique new focus of our historical efforts on the future rather than the past concentrated on learning about future possibilities from history. A growing worldwide community of transdisciplinary scholars is forming around building this Integrated History and future of People on Earth (IHOPE). Building integrated models of past human societies and their interactions with their environments yields new insights into those interactions and can help to create a more sustainable and desirable future. The activity has become a major focus within the global change community. 806:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper presents a quantitative analytical method for measuring functional fit between a specific ecosystem and a defined set of institutions. Functional misfits the focus of this paper can arise as a result of gaps in governance a lack of institutional provision for a socioecological system component or link. The method measures such misfit using a similarity metric (simple matching). This provides an indication of the potential degree of system wide fit between an ecosystem and a relevant set of institutions. A preliminary form of the approach uses the text of ocean and coastal laws and regulations to represent formal institutional arrangements. This basic demonstration helps show the complex interrelationships that have to be taken into account in a systematic evaluation of fit. Beyond the first iteration work continues on developing the analytical capacity of the framework and therefore its utility to assist for example in policy transitions including those to ecosystem based management. 809:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Within fisheries and natural resource management literature there is considerable discussion about the key roles that property rights can play in building biologically and socially sustainable resource management regimes. A key point of agreement is that secure long term property rights provide an incentive for resource users to manage the resource sustainably. However property rights mismatches create ambiguity and conflict in resource use. Though the term mismatches is usually associated with problems in matching temporal and spatial resource characteristics with institutional characteristics I expand it here to include problems that can arise when property rights are incompletely defined or incompletely distributed. Property rights mismatches are particularly likely to occur over marine resources for which multiple types of resource and resource user can be engaged and managed under a variety of regulatory regimes. I used New Zealands marine resources to examine the causes and consequences of these property rights mismatches. New Zealand is particularly interesting because its property rights based commercial fishing regime in the form of individual transferable quotas has attracted considerable positive attention. However my review of the marine natural resource management regime from a broader property rights perspective highlights a series of problems caused by property rights mismatches including competition for resources among commercial customary and recreational fishers; spatial conflict among many marine resource users; and conflicting incentives and objectives for the management of resources over time. The use of a property rights perspective also highlights some potential solutions such as the layering of institutional arrangements and the improvement of how property rights are defined to encourage long term sustainability. 81:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,84:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,86:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial flows of materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries are ubiquitous. Understanding the consequences of these flows should be a basic goal of ecosystem science and yet it has received scant theoretical treatment to date. Here using a simple open nutrient limited ecosystem model with trophic interactions we explore theoretically how spatial flows affect the functioning of local ecosystems how physical mass balance constraints interact with biological demographic constraints in the regulation of this functioning and how failure to consider these constraints explicitly can lead to models that are ecologically inconsistent. In particular we show that standard prey dependent models for trophic interactions may lead to implausible outcomes when embedded in an ecosystem context with appropriate mass flows and mass balance constraints. Our analysis emphasizes the need for integration of population community and ecosystem perspectives in ecology and the critical consequences of assuming closed versus open systems. 894:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ecosystem engineering concept focuses on how organisms physically change the abiotic environment and how this feeds back to the biota. While the concept was formally introduced a little more than 10 years ago the underpinning of the concept can be traced back to more than a century to the early work of Darwin. The formal application of the idea is yielding new insights into the role of species in ecosystems and many other areas of basic and applied ecology. Here we focus on how temporal spatial and organizational scales usefully inform the roles played by ecosystem engineers and their incorporation into broader ecological contexts. Two particular distinguishing features of ecosystem engineers are that they affect the physical space in which other species live and their direct effects can last longer than the lifetime of the organism engineering can in essence outlive the engineer. Together these factors identify critical considerations that need to be included in models experimental and observational work. The ecosystem engineering concept holds particular promise in the area of ecological applications where influence over abiotic variables and their consequent effects on biotic communities may facilitate ecological restoration and counterbalance anthropogenic influences. 8:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,8:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Experience suggests that fully automated schema matching is infeasible especially for n to m matches involving semantic functions. It is therefore advisable for a matching algorithm not only to do as much as possible automatically but also to accurately identify the critical points where user input is maximally useful. Our matching algorithm combines several existing approaches with a new emphasis on using the context provided by the way elements are embedded in paths. A prototype tested on biological data (gene sequence DNA RNA etc.) and on bibliographic data shows significant performance improvements from user feedback and context checking. In non interactive mode on the purchase order schemas it compares favorably with COMA the most mature schema matching system in literature and also correctly identifies critical points for user input. 90:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,927:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Data management is a timely and increasingly important topic for ecologists. Recent funder mandates requiring data management plans combined with the data deluge that faces scientists make education about data management critical for any future ecologist. In this study we surveyed instructors of general ecology courses at 48 major institutions in the United States. We chose instructors at institutions that are likely to train future ecologists and therefore are most likely to influence the trajectory of data management education in this field. The survey queried instructors about institution and course characteristics the extent to which data related topics are included in their courses the barriers to their teaching these topics and their own personal beliefs and values associated with data management and stewardship. We found that in general data management topics are not being covered in undergraduate ecology courses for a wide range of reasons. Most often instructors cited a lack of time and a lack of resources as barriers to teaching data management. Although data are used for instruction at some point in the majority of the courses surveyed good data management practices and a thorough understanding of the importance of data stewardship are not being taught. We offer potential explanations for this and suggestions for improvement. 932:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,935:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Seventh Cary Conference was held in May 1997 at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook New York. The general mission of Cary Conferences is to examine fundamental issues in ecology. Previous conferences have considered diverse topics including long term studies comparative approaches humans as components of ecosystems linking species and ecosystems and the ecological basis for conservation (Pickett and others 1997). We organized the 1997 conference to assess the status of ecosystem science through analysis of notable successes current limitations and future frontiers. Consider first success__what would you name as your five favorite developments in ecosystem science over the past twenty years? Would you focus on the enormous advances in computational and chemical methodologies specific scientific results compelling syntheses or perhaps improved organization and infrastructure? We guess such a list would vary widely among ecosystem ecologists and in part this reflects lack of appreciation of successes in our discipline. For example one success has been evaluation of the causes and consequences of eutrophication in fresh water. Theory and practice are richly endowed here and clear predictions can be given for both general and specific questions about excess nutrient loading in a rivers lakes streams and reservoirs covering a gamut of processes including primary production oxygen dynamics and fish habitat utilization. Although the larger field of ecosystem science understands some of the progress in this area it is not in our view widely trumpeted or even deeply appreciated. Limitations__what holds us back in ecosystem research? Are we stymied by lack of theory poor concepts weak approaches diffuse focus fragmentation technology money brains? Have we applied our science well? Are we working effectively with managers and fostering collaborations and institutions that facilitate learning about real world problems? How might we redress these limitations? The conference focused on these questions by considering limitations to intellectual progress and application of science. As to the future__what are the major frontiers in ecosystem research? What are the key unknowns and how should we proceed? These are tough questions and even tougher to answer for a diverse science like ours. One might think such discussions would be the focus of our national meetings and frequent workshops but those are given usually to the more specific meaty science of the moment__ not the roving sometimes raving discussions needed to pull science forward conceptually. Below we summarize and comment on some but certainly not all of the interesting points raised at the conference. a complete list of conference topics to be published in a forthcoming volume. 955:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The quantity and quality of freshwater resources are now being seriously threatened partly as a result of extensive worldwide changes in land use and scientists are often called upon by policy makers and managers to predict the ecological consequences that these alterations will have for stream ecosystems. The effects of the urbanization of stream ecosystems in the United States over the next 20 years are of particular concern. To address this issue we present a multidisciplinary research agenda designed to improve our forecasting of the effects of land use change on stream ecosystems. Currently there are gaps in both our knowledge and the data that make it difficult to link the disparate models used by economists hydrologists geomorphologists and ecologists. We identify a number of points that practitioners in each discipline were not comfortable compromising on for example by assuming an average condition for a given variable. We provide five instructive examples of the limitations to our ability to forecast the fate of stream and riverine ecosystems one drawn from each modeling step: (a) Accurate economic methods to forecast land use changes over long periods (such as 20 years) are not available especially not at spatially explicit scales; (b) geographic data are not always available at the appropriate resolution and are not always organized in categories that are hydrologically ecologically or economically meaningful; (c) the relationship between low flows and land use is sometimes hard to establish in anthropogenically affected catchments; (d) bed mobility suspended sediment load and channel form all of which are important for ecological communities in streams are difficult to predict; and (e) species distributions in rivers are not well documented and the data that do exist are not always publicly available or have not been sampled at accurate scales making it difficult to model ecological responses to specified levels of environmental change. Meeting these challenges will require both interdisciplinary cooperation and a reviewed commitment to intradisciplinary research in the fields of economics geography quantitative spatial analysis hydrology geomorphology and ecology. 958:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We built ernpirical models to estimate the effects of land cover on stream ecosystems in the mid Adantic region (USA) and to evaluate the spatial scales over which such models are most effective. Predictive variables included land cover in the watershed in the streamside corridor and near the study site and the number and location of dams and point sources in the watershed. Response variables were annual nitrate flux; species richness of fish benthic macroinvertebrates and aquatic plants; and cover of aquatic plants and riparian vegetation. All data were taken from publicly available databases mostly over the Internet. Land cover was significantly correlated with all ecological response variables. Modeled R 2 ranged from 0.07 to 0.5 but large data sets often allowed us to estimate with acceptable precision the regression coefficients that express the change in ecological conditions associated with a unit change in land cover. Dam and pointsource variables were ineffective at predicting ecological conditions in streams and rivers probably because of inadequacies in the data sets. The spatial perspective (whole watershed streamside corridor or local) most effective at predicting ecological response variables varied across response variables apparently in concord with the mechanisms that control each of these variables. We found some evidence that predictive power fell in very small watersheds (less than 1 10 km(2)) Suggesting that the spatial arrangement of landscape patches may become critical at these small scales. Empirical models can replace constrain or be combined with more mechanistic models to understand the effects of land cover change on stream ecosystems. 960:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, During the past six decades the importance of scientific research to the developed world and the daily lives of its citizens has led many industrialized countries to rebrand themselves as knowledge based economies. The increasing role of science as a main driver of innovation and economic growth has also changed the nature of research itself. Starting with the physical sciences recent decades have seen academic research increasingly conducted in the form of large expensive and collaborative big science projects that often involve multidisciplinary multinational teams of scientists engineers and other experts. Although laboratory biology was late to join the big science trend there has nevertheless been a remarkable increase in the number scope and complexity of research collaborations and projects involving biologists over the past two decades. The Human Genome Project (HGP) is arguably the most well known of these and attracted serious scientific public and government attention to big biology. Initial exchanges were polarized and often polemic as proponents of the HGP applauded the advent of big biology and argued that it would produce results unattainable through other means. Critics highlighted the negative consequences of massive scale research including the industrialization bureaucratization and politicization of research. They also suggested that it was not suited to generating knowledge at all; Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner joked that sequencing was so boring it should be done by prisoners: the more heinous the crime the bigger the chromosome they would have to decipher. A recent Opinion in EMBO reports sum marized the arguments against the creeping hegemony of big science over little science in biomedical research. First many large research projects are of questionable scientific and practical value. Second big science transfers the control of research topics and goals to bureaucrats when decisions about research should be primarily driven by the scientific community. Gregory Petsko makes a valid point in his Opinion about wasteful research projects and raises the important question of how research goals should be set and by whom. Here we contextualize Petskos arguments by drawing on the history and sociology of science to expound the drawbacks and benefits of big science. We then advance an alternative to the current antipodes of big and little biology which offers some of the benefits and avoids some of the adverse consequences. 971:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We suggest that fluvial ecosystems are legitimate users of water and that there are basic ecological principles guiding the maintenance of long term ecological vitality. This article articulates some fundamental relationships between physical and ecological processes presents basic principles for maintaining the vitality of fluvial ecosystems identifies several major scientific challenges and opportunities for effective implementation of the basic ecological principles and acts as an introduction to three specific articles to follow on biodiversity biogeochemistry and riparian communities. All the objectives by necessity link climate land and fresh water. The basic principles proposed are: (1) the natural flow regime shapes the evolution of aquatic biota and ecological processes (2) every river has a characteristic flow regime and an associated biotic community and (3) aquatic ecosystems are topographically unique in occupying the lowest position in the landscape thereby integrating catchment scale processes. Scientific challenges for the immediate future relate to quantifying cumulative effects linking multidisciplinary knowledge and models and formulating effective monitoring and assessment procedures. Additionally forecasting the ecological consequences of changing water regimes is a fundamental challenge for science especially as environmental issues related to fresh waters escalate in the next two to three decades. 972:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Models to support decisions on rangeland policy must address the close links between ecological economic and social processes and the adaptation of participants through time. We used an agent based modeling approach to implement a parsimonious conceptual model of rangelands that included biophysical processes central to the functioning of rangelands commercial enterprises and institutions. The model operated on a monthly time step and used economic and biophysical conditions to stimulate changes in management policies and learning. Our simple model reproduced the general patterns of forage growth and livestock dynamics in north east Australia and results illustrate consequences of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and learning rate. 99:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1019:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fisheries management based on catch shares divisions of annual fleet wide quotas among individuals or groups has been strongly supported for their economic benefits but biological consequences have not been rigorously quantified. We used a global meta analysis of 345 stocks to assess whether fisheries under catch shares were more likely to track management targets set for sustainable harvest than fisheries managed only by fleet wide quota caps or effort controls. We examined three ratios: catch to quota current exploitation rate to target exploitation rate and current biomass to target biomass. For each we calculated the mean response variation around the target and the frequency of undesirable outcomes with respect to these targets. Regional effects were stronger than any other explanatory variable we examined. After accounting for region we found the effects of catch shares primarily on catch to quota ratios: these ratios were less variable over time than in other fisheries. Over exploitation occurred in only 9 PeRcEnT of stocks under catch shares compared to 13 PeRcEnT of stocks under fleet wide quota caps. Additionally over exploitation occurred in 41 PeRcEnT of stocks under effort controls suggesting a substantial benefit of quota caps alone. In contrast there was no evidence for a response in the biomass of exploited populations because of either fleet wide quota caps or individual catch shares. Thus for many fisheries management controls improve under catch shares in terms of reduced variation in catch around quota targets but ecological benefits in terms of increased biomass may not be realized by catch shares alone. 1020:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Meta analyses of stock assessments can provide novel insight into marine population dynamics and the status of fished species but the worlds main stock assessment database (the Myers Stock Recruitment Database) is now outdated. To facilitate new analyses we developed a new database the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database for commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates. Time series of total biomass spawner biomass recruits fishing mortality and catch landings form the core of the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295 fish stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks representing 12 families) including nine of the worlds 10 largest fisheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large marine ecosystems the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions and include the Atlantic Pacific Indian Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Most assessments came from the USA Europe Canada New Zealand and Australia. Assessed marine stocks represent a small proportion of harvested fish taxa (16 PeRcEnT) and an even smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity (1 PeRcEnT) but provide high quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database provides new insight into the status of exploited populations: 58 PeRcEnT of stocks with reference points (n equals 214) were estimated to be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and 30 PeRcEnT had exploitation levels above the exploitation rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield (UMSY). We anticipate that the database will facilitate new research in population dynamics and fishery management and we encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists. 1022:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There has been much recent discussion about the idea that large whales are potential competitors with fisheries for available marine resources. Based on this idea often referred to as the whales eat fish conflict culling whales has been proposed as a way to increase resources available for human consumption and thereby ensuring global food security. However the scientific basis for such arguments remains unclear especially in the Caribbean waters where baleen whales generally do not feed. In this article we (i) develop an ecosystem model describing the trophic interactions between whales fish and fisheries in the Caribbean waters (ii) calculate the level of overlap between cetaceans and fisheries for food resources and (iii) simulate the removal of cetaceans from the Caribbean waters in order to quantify the potential increase in available biomass of commercially important fish. Ten groups of cetaceans are considered in the model including baleen whales toothed whales and small cetaceans. Our results suggest that baleen whales are not a threat to fisheries in Caribbean waters while toothed cetaceans seem to be more impacted by fisheries than they actually impacting them. Whales target different types of food resources and consume significantly less than what is taken by fisheries. Moreover simulated reductions in large whale abundance do not produce any appreciable increase in biomass of the commercially important fish species. In some cases the presence of some whales actually improves fishery yield as a result of indirect predation effects. 1023:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate. Oceanography. Biodiversity. Its not that we dont know enough. As Stegner says Cause begets consequences in nature as in logic. Stegner puts his pen on the essence of mathematical modeling as a tool for promoting ecological health. Modeling does not generally reveal anything new. After all it is a logical tool for revealing what we already know__in its finest form some web of small tensions and accommodations and standoffs that make for ecological health__subtle compound relationships. A model can serve as an envelope with a large back. During the winter of 2001 for the first time I was privileged to teach our large undergraduate general education course Fish 101__an introduction to a number of issues surrounding living aquatic resources. Several times during the term I wanted to illuminate a point having to do with balance tradeoff and relativity in a dynamic world. Why might you safely harvest more swordfish than bluefin tuna all other things being equal? Why might the presence of hatchery salmon affect the survival of wild salmon all other things being equal? Simple visual dynamic models enabled me to penetrate a shell of awareness beyond the reach of words into a well of intuitive understanding. These simple models and their visual representations of motion made a difference helping some students open windows onto new worlds. The idea is that I created these models to make a number of points about dynamic relationships. They were if you will made up to show how cause begets consequences in nature as in logic. Nothing new arose from them other than understanding awareness perhaps even a heightened sense of wonder. The Northern California Current (NCC) the coastal oceanic region between northern California and northern Washington is the web of small tensions on which my students and I are cutting our teeth with regard to ecosystem based fishery science and management. The NCC is a large marine ecosystem which to a great degree is driven by the interactions between the atmosphere the ocean and the land. Productivity is seasonal and influenced by local and basin scale climate as well as its location at the eastern boundary of the North Pacific and western boundary of North America. Its biota which serve as the basis of numerous fisheries can be characterized in two important ways. There are massive seasonal movements of fish and plankton into and out of the region pulses of biological activity timed to take advantage of sunlight and spring summer winds. Each spring there is a huge seasonal influx of pelagic fish and marine mammals from the subtropical south young salmon from coastal watersheds and zooplankton from the subarctic north collectively creating a here today gone tomorrow all you can eat supermarket of the sea. Then in the fall the winds change and poof they are gone. In stark contrast the resident demersal (bottom) fish populations of the Pacific Northwest coast are noted for the longevity of their members. They seem to live in a completely different time zone relatively unaffected by the much faster and more volatile pace of life up near the surface. And so productivity in our coastal ocean has a strong seasonal cadence. Plankton meadows appear and disappear seemingly at the whim of the spin of the earth and its movement relative to the sun__the skin of the ocean thickening and thinning mixing and stratifying warming and cooling__fueling the fundamental processes of biological production. Large and highly variable amounts of this productivity are consumed and exported by seasonal migrants. And local residents seem to hunker down and sustain themselves by being able to take advantage of the infrequent coming together of high productivity and low export of critical food. It all fits together in Stegners web of small tensions and accommodations and standoffs that make for ecological health. Until of course we start messing with it indiscriminately extracting great hunks of the system both physical and biological. In order to satisfy our needs we strike out at the ocean without first looking to see what the ocean is doing naturally. We impose our will without first being able to listen to its voice. In the Northern California Current we now have fisheries which have been declared disasters. Coastal salmon stocks are listed under the Endangered Species Act and depleted groundfish populations whose productivities have been overestimated for decades can no longer support a grotesquely contorted and vastly deflated remnant fishery. Many coastal fishing ports are ghostly quiet. Fishery managers seem at a loss to do anything other than what they have done for decades__release more hatchery salmon and further ratchet down the draconian wasteful and perversely complex regulations on coastal fishermen. Might there be new ways for science to inform fishery management other than or in addition to recommending how much of what species can be safely harvested where and when? Have we possibly oversold the predictive capacity of our traditional quantitative science? Is there perhaps a lesson to be learned from Fish 101? It would be useful to paint a dynamic picture of what we already know about climate oceanography and biodiversity in the Northern California Current using models to illustrate what ecological principles and historic evidence reveal to us. If so how might we in turn better inform fishery management? Is there a role for relativism as compared with absolutism in the presentation of scientific advice to managers? Lets see.  1027:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We conducted a large scale held experiment to test whether clam and oyster harvesting applied alone and in combination on intertidal oyster reefs have impacts on resident shellfish populations. This experiment was conducted to resolve a long standing conflict between oyster (Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin 1791)) and clam (Mercenaria mercenaria (Linneaus 1758)) fishermen who contend that the other fishery causes high rates of mortality to their respective species. Intertidal oyster reefs located in two estuarine creeks near Wilmington North Carolina were harvested for clams only oysters only both clams and oysters or were left undisturbed as controls. Experimental harvesting was conducted over a one year period by a professional shellfisherman who used realistic fishing techniques (clam rakes and oyster tongs) intensity and frequency. Harvesting impact on hard clam and oyster populations was assessed by sampling naturally occurring oysters before and after harvesting and sampling both naturally occurring clams (all size classes) and transplanted hatchery raised clams (20 37 mm in length) alter harvesting. Clam and oyster harvesting had obvious negative effects on populations of oysters. There was a substantial decrease in the number of live oysters on clam harvested and oyster harvested reefs compared with unharvested control reefs. Clam and oyster harvesting applied together reduced oyster densities and killed unharvested oysters ata level similar to that caused by each type of harvesting applied separately. The effects of the shellfish harvesting on populations of hard clams varied between the two sites  creeks). In both creeks clam harvesting alone and combined with oyster harvesting significantly decreased the number of live naturally occurring clams. Oyster harvesting alone decreased the number of live naturally occurring clams only at one site. Clam harvesting also decreased the number of live transplanted clams on reefs but there was no effect of oyster harvesting because the transplanted clams were juveniles too small to be harvested with oyster tongs. Overall the combined effect of both types of harvesting applied together did not have a negative synergistic effect an clam and oyster populations. Consequently both clamming and oyster harvesting should be permitted on some reefs but maintaining large populations of oysters and clams on intertidal oyster reefs will require protection of some reefs from bath types of harvesting. 1041:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In large deep oligotrophic lakes the shallow nearshore waters may provide the most important habitat for animals to feed and breed and it is this area of the lake where humans are most likely to have initial impacts as the shoreline is developed. Nutrients in fertilizers sediments and sewage effluents are likely to be rapidly intercepted by nearshore algae at the lake edge having heterogeneous effects nearshore before offshore effects are noted. Here we examined the spatially explicit effects of residential development on nearshore periphyton communities in three large deep oligotrophic lakes that have all experienced modest residential development in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. We demonstrate that substantial nearshore changes in the basal food web are detectable even with low levels of shoreline development. These changes can potentially affect whole lake food web dynamics. For our primary study site (Lake Crescent Washington USA) we found that algal biomass and accumulation of detritus were higher at developed sites. In addition both macroinvertebrate and periphyton communities exhibited a shift in composition with more detritivores and filamentous green algae at developed sites. These differences were more pronounced during the spring than at other times of year. A complementary investigation of field patterns in Priest Lake and Lake Pend Oreille (Idaho USA) suggested that although spatial and temporal patterns were idiosyncratic indicators of productivity and the presence of filamentous green algae were generally higher at developed sites across lakes. Stable isotope signatures and water column nutrients were not useful in distinguishing developed and undeveloped sites increasing the potential usefulness of periphyton monitoring during early stages of lake development. A laboratory investigation suggested that common macroinvertebrate grazers assimilated a much greater proportion of diatoms than the filamentous green algae that are associated with fertilization at developed sites. These findings have at least two clear implications: (i) periphyton may be used to detect human impacts before disturbance is evident in offshore monitoring programmes and (ii) nearshore impacts in response to modest residential development have the potential to disrupt lake food web dynamics. 1058:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Globally fisheries catch of non target species has major environmental impacts resulting in social conflict litigation and fisheries closures. We use a bio economic approach to demonstrate that compensatory mitigation an innovative market influenced approach to fishery conservation conflicts can facilitate high value uses of biological resources and cost effective conservation gains for species of concern. We illustrate the strategy with a seabird example: levying fishers for their bycatch and using the funds to remove invasive mammals from breeding islands. Removal of invasive predators is 23 times more effective from a return on investment perspective (ie percent increase in population growth per dollar invested) in comparison to fisheries closures and is more socio politically feasible. A bycatch levy which would increase with endangerment provides an individual incentive for avoiding bycatch the most effective mechanism for sustainable management of fisheries. Compensatory mitigation provides an opportunity to address a global concern optimize conservation interventions and forge an alliance between conservation and fisheries organizations. 1059:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Jellyfish (Cnidaria Scyphozoa) blooms appear to be increasing in both intensity and frequency in many coastal areas worldwide due to multiple hypothesized anthropogenic stressors. Here we propose that the proliferation of artificial structures associated with (1) the exponential growth in shipping aquaculture and other coastal industries and (2) coastal protection (collectively   ocean sprawl  ) provides habitat for jellyfish polyps and may be an important driver of the global increase in jellyfish blooms. However the habitat of the benthic polyps that commonly result in coastal jellyfish blooms has remained elusive limiting our understanding of the drivers of these blooms. Support for the hypothesized role of ocean sprawl in promoting jellyfish blooms is provided by observations and experimental evidence demonstrating that jellyfish larvae settle in large numbers on artificial structures in coastal waters and develop into dense concentrations of jellyfish producing polyps. 1060:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Land use watershed processes and coastal biodiversity are often intricately linked yet land sea interactions are usually ignored when selecting terrestrial and marine reserves with existing models. Such oversight increases the risk that reserves will fail to achieve their conservation objectives. The conceptual model underlying existing reserve selection models presumes each site is a closed ecological system unaffected by inputs from elsewhere. As a short term objective we recommend extending land conservation analyses to account for effects on marine biodiversity by considering linkages between ecosystems. This level of integration seems feasible and directly relevant to agencies and conservancies engaged in protecting coastal lands. We propose an approach that evaluates terrestrial sites based on whether they benefit or harm marine species or habitats. We then consider a hypothetical example involving estuarine nurseries. Whether this approach will produce more effective terrestrial reserves remains to be seen. 1069:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seagrasses are important marine foundation species that are reported to be declining worldwide with almost 15 PeRcEnT of species considered threatened. Seagrasses are highly productive plants that reconfigure water flow and influence nutrient cycling as well as provide critical habitat for a wide array of fish and invertebrate species. Yet many of these seagrass dependent species including economically important fishes and invertebrates are themselves in danger of overexploitation or extinction. In fact there is on average more than one threatened associated species for every seagrass species across the globe. Links between threatened seagrasses and their dependent communities illustrate the importance of an ecosystem based management approach that incorporates interdependencies and facilitation among species. 1094:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Long term observations show that fish and plankton populations in the ocean fluctuate in synchrony with large scale climate patterns but similar evidence is lacking for estuaries because of shorter observational records. Marine fish and invertebrates have been sampled in San Francisco Bay since 1980 and exhibit large unexplained population changes including record high abundances of common species after 1999. Our analysis shows that populations of demersal fish crabs and shrimp covary with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) both of which reversed signs in 1999. A time series model forced by the atmospheric driver of NPGO accounts for two thirds of the variability in the first principal component of species abundances and generalized linear models forced by PDO and NPGO account for most of the annual variability of individual species. We infer that synchronous shifts in climate patterns and community variability in San Francisco Bay are related to changes in oceanic wind forcing that modify coastal currents upwelling intensity surface temperature and their influence on recruitment of marine species that utilize estuaries as nursery habitat. Ecological forecasts of estuarine responses to climate change must therefore consider how altered patterns of atmospheric forcing across ocean basins influence coastal oceanography as well as watershed hydrology. 1124:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Multiple anthropogenic impacts including bleaching from climate change related thermal stress threaten coral reefs. Protecting coral capacity to respond to the increase in future thermal stress expected with climate change can involve (1) protecting coral reefs with characteristics indicative of greater resistance and resilience to climate change and (2) reducing other anthropogenic impacts that are more likely to reduce coral resistance and resilience to climate change. Here we quantitatively compare possible priorities and existing recommendations for protecting coral response capacity to climate change. Specifically we explore the relative importance of the relevant dynamics processes and parameters in a size structured model of coral and zooxanthellae ecological and evolutionary dynamics given projected future thermal stress. Model results with varying initial conditions indicate that protecting diverse coral communities is critical and protecting communities with higher abundances of more thermally tolerant coral species and symbiont types secondary to the long term maintenance of coral cover. A sensitivity analysis of the coral population size in each size class and the total coral cover with respect to all parameter values suggests greater relative importance of reducing additional anthropogenic impacts that affect coral macroalgal competition early coral life history stages and coral survivorship (compared with reproduction growth and shrinkage). Finally model results with temperature trajectories from different locations with and without connectivity indicate that protection of and connectivity to low thermal stress locations may enhance the capacity for corals to respond to climate change. 1164:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Since the collapse of populations of northern quahogs (hard clam) Mercenaria mercenaria in Long Island bays brown tide blooms have been proposed to pose a barrier to recovery. We tested whether the brown tide alga Aureococcus anophagefferens affects survivorship development or growth in the larvae of M. mercenaria. There was no effect of A. anophagefferens (clone CCMP1708) on survivorship of hard clam larvae even at bloom concentrations. Under most experimental conditions larvae fed a mixed diet of Isochrysis galbana (T Iso) and A. anophagefferens or a single species diet of A. anophagefferens developed faster than those fed a single species diet of Isochrysis. A mixed diet of I. galbana and A. anophagefferens either had no effect on larval growth or produced enhanced growth at moderate cell densities (8 x 10(4) cells ml( 1) of A. anophagefferens). Similarly moderate cell densities of a single food diet of A. anophagefferens (1.6 x 10(5) cells ml( 1)) generally had no effect on the growth of larvae. When fed bloom concentrations (10(6) cells ml( 1)) of A. anophagefferens larvae developed faster but growth was reduced compared to those fed an equal biovolume of Isochrysis. Larvae fed slow growing or near stationary phase cultures of A. anophagefferens experienced reduced growth and slowed development. These data suggest a qualitative difference between slow or stationary phase and fast growing cultures of the brown tide alga. They also suggest that impacts of A. anophagefferens when present are likely to be due to the nutritional quality of this alga as a food source for hard clam larvae which could have a lasting legacy through ontogeny. Additional studies are needed to test whether our findings apply to more recently isolated strains of A. anophagefferens. 1179:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Artificial reefs have been proposed as a tool to mitigate impacts on natural reefs augment natural fish production and divert detrimental harvesting activities from sensitive natural habitats. The efficacy of this strategy depends on the extent to which artificial reefs contribute to new production or simply redistribute fish during or after settlement. Small coral reef fishes are ideal study subjects because redistribution is most likely during the larval stage given limited dispersal of benthic stages. We develop a model that incorporates the simultaneous effects of habitat augmentation competition among reefs for larval settlers and post settlement density dependence and propose two experimental approaches for evaluating the effects of artificial reefs on local production of natural reefs. One is based on small scale studies using replicated patch reefs the other on unreplicated studies using larger reefs and the Before After Control Impact Paired Series (BACIPS) design. Using field data for six fish species we estimated spatial and temporal variance and thus statistical power of both designs. Power varied among species but in most cases was sufficiently high to detect local reductions in density of 10 40 PeRcEnT with modest levels of replication (6 20 patch reefs or sampling dates). 1180:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosim models have been fitted to time series data for a wide variety of ecosystems for which there are long term data that confirm the models ability to reproduce past responses of many species to harvesting. We subject these model ecosystems to a variety of harvest policies including options based on harvesting each species at its maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishing rate. We show that widespread application of single species MSY policies would in general cause severe deterioration in ecosystem structure in particular the loss of top predator species. This supports the long established practice in fisheries management of protecting at least some smaller   forage   species specifically for their value in supporting larger piscivores. 1181:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Scientific trawl surveys have been conducted in different regions of the world and by a variety of countries and agencies since the mid 1900s. Although the data are collected in a scientifically and statistically appropriate context and represent an important source of fishery independent information for agency specific stock assessments their use and dissemination has often been limited to the agencies conducting the surveys. In recent years Internet data portals such as the Ocean Biogeographic Information System have provided an arena for the wider distribution and use of marine fish data. Despite the increased accessibility of such data their scientific acceptability has been limited by a lack of reproducibility in data analyses. We present a methodology for the computation of time series of groundfish stock indices using publicly available trawl survey data derived from the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans Maritimes region. Potential pitfalls associated with the computation of time series are discussed and proper stratified random estimates of temporal abundance trends are compared with other methods for a selected subset of species. Also the broader applicability of the methods for datasets collected under similar sampling designs is discussed along with the reproducibility of the analyses and results. 1182:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The assessment of fishery status is essential for management yet fishery independent estimates of abundance are lacking for most fisheries. Methods exist to infer fishery status from catches but the most commonly used method is biased towards classifying fisheries as overexploited or collapsed through time and does not account for still developing fisheries. We introduce a revised method that overcomes these deficiencies by smoothing catch series iteratively declaring fisheries developing within three years of peak catch and calibrating thresholds to biological reference points. Compared with status obtained from stock assessment reference points for 210 stocks our approach provides a more realistic assessment than the original method but cannot be perfect because catches are influenced by factors other than biomass. Applied to FAO catches our method suggests in 2006 32 PeRcEnT of global fisheries were developing 27 PeRcEnT fully exploited 25 PeRcEnT overexploited and 16 PeRcEnT collapsed or closed. Although less dire than previous assessments this still indicates substantial numbers of overexploited stocks. Probably because median exploitation rate decreased since 1992 our catch based results do not reflect recent stabilization of assessed stock biomass. Whether this outlook also applies to unassessed stocks can only be revealed with increased or more representative collection of biomass and exploitation rate trends. 1220:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine cleaning mutualisms generally involve small fish or shrimps removing ectoparasites and other material from cooperating client fish. We evaluate the role of fish abundance body size and behaviour as determinants of interactions with cleaning mutualists. Data come from eight reef locations in Brazil the Caribbean the Mediterranean and Australia. We conducted a meta analysis of client cleaner interactions involving 11 cleaner and 221 client species. There was a strong positive effect of client abundance on cleaning frequency but only a weak negative effect of client body size. These effects were modulated by client trophic group and social behaviour. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting a central role of species abundance in structuring species interactions. 1246:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To investigate how reef fish trophic structure responds to latitudinal changes using a simple model: the extensive Brazilian coast. Six Brazilian tropical and subtropical coral and rocky coastal reefs and the oceanic island of Atol das Rocas between latitudes 0 degrees and 27 degrees S. Underwater visual census data collected by the authors (five locations) or obtained from the literature (two locations) were used to estimate the relative abundance of 123 fish species belonging to 33 reef associated families. Cryptic species were excluded from the analysis. Fishes were grouped in eight trophic categories: roving herbivores territorial herbivores mobile invertebrate feeders sessile invertebrate feeders omnivores planktivores piscivores and carnivores. After a series of detailed predictions based on phylogeny physiological constraints and anthropogenic impacts was established the community trophic structure was analysed along a latitudinal gradient and among coastal mid shore and oceanic sites. The trophic structure of Brazilian reef fish assemblages clearly changed with latitude. Roving herbivores such as scarids and acanthurids were proportionally more abundant at low latitudes. The browsing herbivores kyphosids followed an opposite latitudinal pattern. The parrotfish genus Sparisoma more plastic in its feeding habits than Scarus presented wider distribution. The relative abundance of territorial herbivores did not decrease towards higher latitudes. Mobile invertebrate feeders were the most important (in low latitudes) or the second most important trophic guild (in high latitudes) at all coastal sites. Sessile invertebrate feeders did not show any clear latitudinal trend despite an expected increase in abundance towards low latitudes. Omnivores dominated high latitude reefs (27 degrees S) and planktivores the oceanic island Atol das Rocas. Piscivores and carnivores were proportionally better represented in high latitudes. Latitudinal patterns seem to be influenced by phylogeny physiological constraints (mainly related to temperature) and also by anthropogenic impacts. Grazing scarids and acanthurids are largely restricted to tropical reefs and show an abrupt decline beyond 23 degrees S. This does not reflect the amount of algae present but probably temperature dependent physiological constraints. Other herbivores seem to overcome this through symbiotic microbial digestive processes (kyphosids) manipulating the structure of algal turfs or increasing animal protein from within the territory (pomacentrids). Omnivores dominate the southern sites Arraial do Cabo and Arvoredo being more adapted to environment constraints related to seasonal and or stochastic shifts. Large carnivores (including piscivores) extend farther into high latitude habitats apparently not constrained by thermal thresholds that limit the herbivores. Overfishing and or ornamental harvesting certainly has been modifying local fish communities but could not be detected properly at the large scale patterns found in this study. The data presented put in evidence for the first time how reef fish trophic structure behave in the extensive south western Atlantic latitudinal gradient. 1274:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A literature review revealed that at least 56 non native species primarily invertebrates and seaweeds have been introduced to seagrass beds largely through shipping boating activities and aquaculture. Four seagrass species also have been introduced. The introductions of the seaweeds Caulerpa taxifolia C. racemosa v. cylindracea Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides Sargassum muticum the Asian mussel Musculista senhousia and the seagrass Zostera japonica are the best known examples in seagrass beds. The ecological effects on seagrasses and associated communities have been examined for slightly less than half of the introduced species which have predominantly negative effects. There is a paucity of experimental data for ecological effects particularly for seagrass community structure and function. The exception to this finding is the introduction of the seagrass Z. japonica with oyster aquaculture to native eelgrass beds on the Pacific coasts of Canada and the USA. Recent experiments in several different seagrass ecosystems confirmed that disturbance contributes to the invasibility of seagrass beds. More definitive studies are required to elucidate the relative effects of nutrient pollution and introduced species in causing seagrass decline particularly where reduced herbivory and boating activity also covary. Seagrass beds often are subject to multiple introduced species but their cumulative effect has been virtually unstudied. The potential for compounded negative effects merits serious attention. Heightened attention to the issue of introduced species in seagrass beds is called for given the evidence that introduced species can contribute to seagrass decline to biodiversity changes that could affect seagrass ecosystem functions and that they can compromise seagrass restoration. Comprehensive surveys in seagrass beds complemented by more stringent experimental and mensurative sampling designs are needed. In the interim conserving seagrass density and bed size can offer resistance to introduced species. Managing to prevent the introductions including restricting transplantations of non native biota during seagrass restorations is likely to bear positive benefits for seagrass ecosystems. 1276:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seagrasses marine flowering plants are widely distributed along temperate and tropical coastlines of the world. Seagrasses have key ecological roles in coastal ecosystems and can form extensive meadows supporting high biodiversity. The global species diversity of seagrasses is low ( 60 species) but species can have ranges that extend for thousands of kilometers of coastline. Seagrass bioregions are defined here based on species assemblages species distributional ranges and tropical and temperate influences. Six global bioregions are presented: four temperate and two tropical. The temperate bioregions include the Temperate North Atlantic the Temperate North Pacific the Mediterranean and the Temperate Southern Oceans. The Temperate North Atlantic has low seagrass diversity the major species being Zostera marina typically occurring in estuaries and lagoons. The Temperate North Pacific has high seagrass diversity with Zostera spp. in estuaries and lagoons as well as Phyllospadix spp. in the surf zone. The Mediterranean region has clear water with vast meadows of moderate diversity of both temperate and tropical seagrasses dominated by deep growing Posidonia oceanica. The Temperate Southern Oceans bioregion includes the temperate southern coastlines of Australia Africa and South America. Extensive meadows of low to high diversity temperate seagrasses are found in this bioregion dominated by various species of Posidonia and Zostera. The tropical bioregions are the Tropical Atlantic and the Tropical Indo Pacific both supporting mega herbivore grazers including sea turtles and sirenia. The Tropical Atlantic bioregion has clear water with a high diversity of seagrasses on reefs and shallow banks dominated by Thalassia testudinum. The vast Tropical Indo Pacific has the highest seagrass diversity in the world with as many as 14 species growing together on reef flats although seagrasses also occur in very deep waters. The global distribution of seagrass genera is remarkably consistent north and south of the equator; the northern and southern hemispheres share ten seagrass genera and only have one unique genus each. Some genera are much more speciose than others with the genus Halophila having the most seagrass species. There are roughly the same number of temperate and tropical seagrass genera as well as species. The most widely distributed seagrass is Ruppia maritima which occurs in tropical and temperate zones in a wide variety of habitats. Seagrass bioregions at the scale of ocean basins are identified based on species distributions which are supported by genetic patterns of diversity. Seagrass bioregions provide a useful framework for interpreting ecological physiological and genetic results collected in specific locations or from particular species. 1277:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, South west Australia contains extensive seagrass meadows along 2 500 km of coastline from the shallow subtidal to 50 m water depths and in many of the 51 bar built estuaries along the coast. There are geomorphological differences between the south and west coasts that result in different patterns of swell exposure influencing the processes that structure seagrass habitats. In this paper sheltered exposed and estuarine seagrass habitat types are defined for south west Australia to synthesize processes influencing seagrass communities. Sheltered habitats in south west Australia are characterized by high light low to moderate water motion and sporadic disturbance from storms making them ideal habitats for a diversity of seagrass assemblages. Exposed seagrass habitats are characterized by the presence of strong and consistent ocean swells (3 8 m) predominantly from the south or south west and seagrasses exhibit a suite of adaptive traits to survive the effects of exposure to ocean swell and associated sand movement. These include morphological features such as heavy fiber reinforcement to strengthen the aboveground stems or leaves deep vertical rhizomes and life history traits such as rapid growth and high seed set. Within estuarine habitats highly dynamic seagrass communities are the result of fluctuating annual cycles in temperature light and salinity. Compared to global seagrass meadows coastal south west Australian seagrass habitats experience high light low nutrients and high water movement. Despite these differences similarities with other regions do exist and here we place the habitats of south west Australia into a global context using comparative data. The wide array of morphology and life history traits displayed among seagrass species of southwest Australia are presented in a conceptual model including habitat type physical stressors and seagrass responses. The combination of adaptations to the habitats and processes that define them make south west Australia a region where there is an unusually high number of co occurring seagrass species the highest in the world for a temperate environment (19 species) and approaching the species diversity of many tropical environments. Linking aspects of seagrass habitat physical aspects of the environment and seagrass life history provides a context for applying knowledge gained from seagrasses in south west Australia to other coastal ecosystems throughout the world. 128:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1388:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a common tool for conserving and managing marine and coastal ecosystems. MPAs encompass a range of protection levels from fully protected no take reserves to restriction of only particular activities gear types user groups target species or extraction periods. There is a growing body of scientific evidence supporting the ecological benefits of full reserve protection but it is more difficult to generalize about the effects of other types of MPAs in part because they include a range of actual protection levels. However it is critical to determine whether partial protection and no take reserves provide similar ecological benefits given potential economic costs of lost fishing grounds in no take areas common sociopolitical opposition to full protection and promotion of partially protected areas as a compromise solution in ocean zoning disputes. Here we synthesize all empirical studies comparing biological measures (biomass density species richness and size of organisms) in no take marine reserves and adjacent partially protected and unprotected areas across a range of geographic locations worldwide. We demonstrate that while partially protected areas may confer some benefits over open access areas no take reserves generally show greater benefits and yield significantly higher densities of organisms within their boundaries relative to partially protected sites nearby. 1389:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A critical link missing from our understanding of the nursery role of specific marine habitats is the evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats. This paper reviews and evaluates evidence of and spatial scales for movements from juvenile to adult habitats and it summarises the methods used to study movements. Examples include many fish families but few invertebrate taxa and most are species of economic importance for USA and Australia. The types of juvenile habitat range from the entire estuary or shallow open coastal waters to specific habitats within estuaries or coastal waters; in some cases juvenile habitats include habitats not traditionally regarded as nursery areas  the surf zone). The duration of time spent in juvenile habitats averages 13 mo (range 8 d to 5 yr). The majority of organisms move distances of kilometres to hundreds of kilometres from juvenile to adult habitats although the scale of movements ranged from metres to thousands of kilometres. Changes in abundance among separate habitats and the progression of size classes among separate habitats are the main methods used to infer movement and habitat connectivity. Spatial partitioning of stages of maturity natural parasites and a variety of artificial tagging methods have also been used. The latter will become more useful with continued developments in the miniaturisation of artificial tags. More recent studies have used natural tags  trace elements and stable isotopes) and these methods show great promise for determining movements from juvenile to adult habitats. Few studies provide good evidence for movement from specific juvenile habitats to adult habitats. Future studies need to focus on this movement to supplement data on density growth and survival of organisms in putative nursery habitats. Such information will allow management and conservation efforts to focus on those habitats that make the greatest contribution to adult populations. 1393:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nearshore marine habitats such as seagrass beds and mangroves are generally assumed to be key nurseries for many marine species. Few studies however have examined relationships between the characteristics of juvenile habitats and the size of adult populations although such studies are essential for confirming and quantifying the nursery function of these habitats. In this paper I describe the results of surveys of adult populations of 2 coral reef fish species (the yellow fin mojarra Gerres cinereus and the schoolmaster Lutjanus apodus) that are thought to be dependent on mangroves as nurseries in the Virgin Islands Caribbean Sea to determine if the size of nearby mangrove stands and their proximity to adult reef habitat are related to adult densities. The results indicate that these 2 factors do not affect adult fish densities on coral reef patches. However evidence suggests that a relationship between the island wide size of mangroves and adult fish densities and population sizes exists for at least 1 fish species at the island scale indicating that juvenile habitat may limit adult fish numbers for some species at this scale. 1395:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seasonal summertime hypoxia (dissolved oxygen   2 mg l( 1)) has occurred over large areas ( 1000 to 20 000 km(2)) of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico shelf during several years since at least the mid 1980s resulting in habitat loss for demersal species. To evaluate the effects of hypoxia induced habitat loss on Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus and brown shrimp Farfante penaeus aztecus we compared species spatial distributions and relationships to abiotic factors (temperature dissolved oxygen salinity) across years differing in the spatial extent of hypoxia Analysis of 14 yr of fishery independent research trawl and environmental data (July) indicated that hypoxia induced shifts in spatial distribution result in considerable shifts in the temperature and oxygen conditions that croaker and brown shrimp experience. Croaker which typically occupy relatively warm inshore waters remain in the warmest waters inshore of the hypoxic region but also are displaced to cooler offshore waters. Brown shrimp which are typically distributed more broadly and further offshore shift to relatively warm inshore waters as well as cooler waters near the offshore hypoxic edge. These shifts in the species spatial distribution are reflected in long term decreases and increases in the mean temperatures occupied by croaker and brown shrimp respectively as well as increases in the variance in occupied temperatures for both species. Despite avoidance of the lowest oxygen waters high densities of croaker and brown shrimp occur in areas of moderately low oxygen concentration (35 to 60 PeRcEnT air saturation 1.6 to 3.7 mg l( 1)) near the offshore hypoxic edge. Because temperature and dissolved oxygen are important abiotic factors that impact metabolic scope these shifts in spatial distribution during severe hypoxia may impact organism energy budgets. High croaker and shrimp densities near the hypoxic edge likely have implications for trophic interactions as well as the harvest of both target (brown shrimp) and nontarget (croaker) species by the commercial shrimp fishery. 1397:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The California sheephead Semicossyphus pulcher and the kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus are members of a suite of nearshore reef species that have subtropical taxonomic affiliations and important fisheries in the Southern California Bight (SCB). This suite shows high interannual fluctuation in recruitment success in the SCB with no known cause. One hypothesis gaining mention in management literature is the idea that recruitment booms in the SCB originate from larvae swept poleward from Mexico during El Nino flow reversal events. If true SCB stocks may be reliant on Mexican sources. We used 3 diverse sources of data to investigate the likelihood of El Nino driven recruitment success and connectivity for S. pulcher and P. clathratus. Time series of larval abundance revealed that neither species shows synchrony with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles that would suggest influx of Mexican larvae during El Nino flow reversals. R clathratus age structure data show that recruitment strength is unrelated to ENSO cycles but correlates to spring sea surface temperature in the SCB indicating that local environmental factors drive interannual variation in local production. Genetic analyses of 14 populations of P. clathratus with 7 microsatellite loci revealed distinct patterns of genetic structure in the SCB and Baja California that reflect localized connectivity patterns and contradict patterns that would be expected if dispersal primarily occurred during El Nino flow reversals. While these results support the importance of protecting local sources in the SCB continued study of dispersal and recruitment at large scales will help characterize the causes of interannual variation and the exact scale of cross border connectivity. 1399:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The vast majority of published papers concerning seagrass meadows contain statements to the effect that seagrass beds serve as important nurseries for many species. We reviewed more than 200 papers that were relevant to the nursery role hypothesis. We used both vote counting and meta analytic techniques to evaluate whether the body of previous studies that report seagrass meadows to be nursery grounds actually contain data that support this proposition. We restricted our analyses to papers that compared seagrass beds to other habitats and examined data on a variety of well studied species concerning their density growth survival and migration to adult habitat. Within this group of papers we considered potential factors that could influence the nursery function  location or laboratory vs field studies). We also evaluated case histories of well documented large scale seagrass losses on the nursery function. Major results were consistent with the expectations that abundance growth and survival were greater in seagrass than in unstructured habitats. Abundance data also suggested that seagrass beds in the Northern Hemisphere might be more important as nursery areas than those in the Southern Hemisphere. Surprisingly few significant differences existed in abundance growth or survival when seagrass meadows were compared to other structured habitats such as oyster or cobble reefs or macroalgal beds. Nor were there decreases in harvests of commercially important species that could clearly be attributed to significant seagrass declines in 3 well studied areas. However there were decreased abundances of juveniles of commercially important species in these areas suggesting a strong link between seagrass abundance and those of juvenile finfish and shellfish. One important implication of these results is that structure per se rather than the type of structure appears to be an important determinant of nursery value. Clearly more rigorous studies that test all aspects of the nursery role hypothesis are clearly needed for seagrass meadows as well as other structured habitats. The results of such studies will allow better decisions to be made concerning the conservation and restoration of marine habitats. 13:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An ecosystem model of the southern Benguela was fitted to available time series data for the period 1978 2002 to explore how changes in target fish populations in this ecosystem can be attributed to feeding interaction terms and population control patterns the impact of fishing and environmental forcing. Fishing patterns were estimated to explain only 2 3 PeRcEnT of the variability in the time series whereas an estimated productivity forcing pattern applied to phytoplankton explained 4 12 PeRcEnT of the variance represented by the sum of squares. Model settings describing prey vulnerability to their predators could explain around 40 PeRcEnT of the variability in the time series. Modelled stock dynamics in the southern Benguela ecosystem more closely represent observed time series when wasp waist control by small pelagic fish is simulated. Overall model simulations suggest that almost half the variance in the time series can be explained based on a combination of fishing vulnerability settings and productivity patterns. Variation in mortalities and prey preferences over time as well as model fits in relation to available effort series are discussed. The study advances a model with improved parameterization and credibility to assist with an ecosystem approach to South African fisheries management. 1400:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is global concern about the interaction between whales and fisheries and in some countries great whales are viewed as a threat to fisheries by potentially eating fish species that could be exploited for human consumption. We developed an ecosystem model to explore the trophic interactions between cetaceans and fisheries off Northwest Africa and to examine the potential impact of a reduction in the abundance of baleen whales on fishery yields. This allowed us to characterize the structure and function of the ecosystem in terms of biomass mortalities consumption rates food habits and fisheries. Faced with sparse data for our study area we explicitly accounted for uncertainty in ecosystem structure model accuracy and input data and conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis. We tested model performance with time series of biomass and catches for important species of the system. Our results indicate that the overlap between prey species consumed by cetaceans and species targeted in fisheries is low. Furthermore for a wide range of assumptions about whale abundances diet composition and food consumption in breeding areas we found that whale consumption is several orders of magnitude lower than total fishery catches and 2 orders of magnitude lower than the amounts taken by other trophic groups. Finally simulations of substantial reductions of whale populations did not influence the biomass of commercially important fish nor any other species of the foodweb. These results suggest that fisheries yields would not benefit from the removal of whales in this area. 1401:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examined the nursery role of salt marshes for transient nekton by searching the literature for data on density growth and survival of juvenile fishes and decapod crustaceans in marshes and using meta analyses to test hypotheses. We analyzed density data from 32 studies conducted throughout the world Based on fish density habitat types could be ranked from highest to lowest as: seagrass   vegetated marsh edge nonvegetated marsh open water macroalgae oyster reefs   vegetated inner marsh. However patterns of habitat use varied among the 29 fish species represented. For decapod crustaceans (seven species) habitat types were ranked: seagrass   vegetated marsh edge   nonvegetated marsh vegetated inner marsh open water macroalgae   oyster reef. We identified only 5 comparative studies on transient nekton growth in salt marshes. Fish growth in nonvegetated salt marsh was not significantly different from growth in open water or in macroalgae beds but was significantly lower than in seagrass. Growth of decapod crustaceans was higher in vegetated marsh than in nonvegetated marsh. Nekton survival in salt marsh (11 studies analyzed) was higher than in open water lower than in oyster reef cobble and not significantly different from survival in seagrass. When density growth and survival are all considered the relative nursery value of salt marshes for nekton appears higher than open water but lower than seagrass. Vegetated marsh appears to have a higher nursery value than nonvegetated marsh; however tidal dynamics and nekton movement among marsh components complicates these comparisons. The available data have a strong geographical bias; most studies originated in the northern Gulf of Mexico or on the Atlantic coast of the United States. This bias may be significant because there is some evidence that salt marsh nursery value is dependent on geography salinity regimes and tidal amplitude. 1404:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recognizing that all management decisions have impacts on the ecosystem being exploited an ecosystem based approach to management seeks to better inform these decisions with knowledge of ecosystem structure processes and functions. For marine fisheries in the California Current along the West Coast of North America such an approach must take into greater consideration the constantly changing climate driven physical and biological interactions in the ecosystem the trophic relationships between fished and unfished elements of the food web the adaptation potential of life history diversity and the role of humans as both predators and competitors. This paper reviews fisheries based ecosystem tools insights and management concepts and presents a transitional means of implementing an ecosystem based approach to managing US fisheries in the California Current based on current scientific knowledge and interpretation of existing law. 1405:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seafood is widely considered to be either fished or farmed. In contrast to this perception many types of seafood are produced by enterprises using a combination of techniques traditionally ascribed to either fisheries or aquaculture. Categorizing seafood as either fished or farmed obfuscates the growth potential and environmental impacts of global seafood production. To better capture seafood data national and international record keeping organizations should add a new hybrid category for seafood produced using both fisheries and aquaculture methods. . 1406:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The abrupt decline in the seas capacity to provide crucial ecosystem services requires a new ecosystem based approach for maintaining and recovering biodiversity and integrity. Ecosystems are places so marine spatial planners and managers must understand the heterogeneity of biological communities and their key components (especially apex predators and structure forming species) and of key processes  population connectivity interaction webs biogeochemistry) that maintain them. as well as heterogeneity of human uses. Maintaining resistance and resilience to stressors is crucial. Because marine populations and ecosystems exhibit complex system behaviors managers cannot safety assume they will recover when stressors are reduced so prevention is a far more robust management strategy than seeking a cure for degraded systems. 1407:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The aim of the Geospatial Assessment of Marine Ecosystems (GAME) project is to develop an inventory of habitat related data within the Gulf of Mexico and East coast of Florida. This will serve as a foundation to develop a spatial framework for ecosystem based management associated with regulatory and planning programs and areas of governmental coordination. The data inventory will have both a regional and local scope and will focus on gathering data and mapping coastal habitats from the estuaries onshore to the edge of the continental shelf offshore. The synthesis of data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) compatible database will enable the overlay of diverse information in a way that permits transparent and intuitive visualization of habitats and marine resources. Information gaps will be identified and maps produced. The availability Of updated maps derived from a spatially organized database can allow rapid access to the information needed to enhance the understanding and protection of habitats and their associated marine resources. In addition data mining of historical data  from reports and publications) and their subsequent inventory using metadata standards within an organized data management framework will benefit both researchers and decision makers. 140:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1448:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, How close to maximum sustainable food provision is current seafood harvest from the world__s oceans? Halpern .1 suggest that the answer is 25 PeRcEnT from a global index of food provision part of their multifaceted index of ocean health. Rigorous methods used for management however demonstrate that their food provision index is uncorrelated with actual food provision and that global ocean food provision is in the range of 71 95 PeRcEnT. Their results stem from an uncertain method of estimating maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and we believe that this approach should be avoided as a measure of food provision. 1450:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,Researchers are divided over the wisdom of using estimates of the amount of fish hauled in each year to assess the health of fisheries.1459:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biodiversity indicators provide a vital window on the state of the planet guiding policy development and management(1 2). The most widely adopted marine indicator is mean trophic level (MTL) from catches intended to detect shifts from high trophic level predators to low trophic level invertebrates and plankton feeders(3 5). This indicator underpins reported trends in human impacts declining when predators collapse (  fishing down marine food webs)(3) and when low trophic level fisheries expand (  fishing through marine food webs)(6). The assumption is that catch MTL measures changes in ecosystem MTL and biodiversity(2 5). Here we combine model predictions with global assessments of MTL from catches trawl surveys and fisheries stock assessments(7) and find that catch MTL does not reliably predict changes in marine ecosystems. Instead catch MTL trends often diverge from ecosystem MTL trends obtained from surveys and assessments. In contrast to previous findings of rapid declines in catch MTL(3) we observe recent increases in catch survey and assessment MTL. However catches from most trophic levels are rising which can intensify fishery collapses even when MTL trends are stable or increasing. To detect fishing impacts on marine biodiversity we recommend greater efforts to measure true abundance trends for marine species especially those most vulnerable to fishing. 1500:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Multiple activities affect the marine environment in concert yet current management primarily considers activities in isolation. A shift towards a more comprehensive management of these activities as with recent emphasis on ecosystem based approaches to management requires a means for evaluating their interactive and cumulative impacts. Here we develop a framework for this evaluation focusing on five core concepts: (1) activities have interactive and cumulative impacts (2) management decisions require consideration of and tradeoffs among all ecosystem services (3) not all stressors are equal or have impacts that increase linearly (4) management must account for the different scales of activities and impacts and (5) some externalities cannot be controlled locally but must be accounted for in marine spatial planning. Comprehensive ocean zoning provides a powerful tool with which these key concepts are collectively addressed. 158:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,158:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Every manager must assess and prioritize anthropogenic impacts on their management area from a long list of threats but data which allow comparison of the relative ecological impacts of threats for decision making is often unavailable. This study employed a systematic and standardized method to collect and quantitatively synthesize expert opinion on the ecological effects of anthropogenic threats to the worlds largest marine protected area: the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (MNM) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). In contrast to most threat ranking exercises the method provides detail on the reasons behind a particular ranking of threats to an area and why the ranking may vary across the ecological landscape. Survey results from 25 experts allowed the comparison of the Vulnerability of eight NWHI ecozones to 24 anthropogenic threats in a quantitative manner. Ecozones tended to have distinct top threats: sea level rise was identified its the top threat to rocky intertidal beach and terrestrial ecozones; sea temperature rise was the top threat to the coral reef ecozones; bottom fishing was the top threat to the deep reef bank ecozone; and pelagic fishing in the wider Pacific was the top threat to the pelagic ecozone owing to impacts on bird turtle and fish fauna that forage outside the Papahanaumokuakea MNM boundaries. Many of these top threats are difficult for local managers to control because they arise from activities outside the Papahanaumokuakea MNM boundaries indicating that additional work is needed to preserve the NWHI despite its highly protected status. The analysis indicates where inter agency cooperation in removing and mitigating threats should be focused. 160:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1670:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Disease outbreaks alter the structure and function of marine ecosystems directly affecting vertebrates (mammals turtles fish) invertebrates (corals crustaceans echinoderms) and plants (seagrasses). Previous studies suggest a recent increase in marine disease. However lack of baseline data in most communities prevents a direct test of this hypothesis. We developed a proxy to evaluate a prediction of the increasing disease hypothesis: the proportion of scientific publications reporting disease increased in recent decades. This represents to our knowledge the first quantitative use of normalized trends in the literature to investigate an ecological hypothesis. We searched a literature database for reports of parasites and disease (hereafter   disease  ) in nine marine taxonomic groups from 1970 to 2001. Reports normalized for research effort increased in turtles corals mammals urchins and molluscs. No significant trends were detected for seagrasses decapods or sharks rays (though disease occurred in these groups). Counter to the prediction disease reports decreased in fishes. Formulating effective resource management policy requires understanding the basis and timing of marine disease events. Why disease outbreaks increased in some groups but not in others should be a priority for future investigation. The increase in several groups lends urgency to understanding disease dynamics particularly since few viable options currently exist to mitigate disease in the oceans. 1688:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Worldwide finfish fisheries are receiving increasing assessment and regulation slowly leading to more sustainable exploitation and rebuilding. In their wake invertebrate fisheries are rapidly expanding with little scientific scrutiny despite increasing socio economic importance. We provide the first global evaluation of the trends drivers and population and ecosystem consequences of invertebrate fisheries based on a global catch database in combination with taxa specific reviews. We also develop new methodologies to quantify temporal and spatial trends in resource status and fishery development. Since 1950 global invertebrate catches have increased 6 fold with 1.5 times more countries fishing and double the taxa reported. By 2004 34 PeRcEnT of invertebrate fisheries were over exploited collapsed or closed. New fisheries have developed increasingly rapidly with a decrease of 6 years ( 3 years) in time to peak from the 1950s to 1990s. Moreover some fisheries have expanded further and further away from their driving market encompassing a global fishery by the 1990s. 71 PeRcEnT of taxa (53 PeRcEnT of catches) are harvested with habitat destructive gear and many provide important ecosystem functions including habitat filtration and grazing. Our findings suggest that invertebrate species which form an important component of the basis of marine food webs are increasingly exploited with limited stock and ecosystem impact assessments and enhanced management attention is needed to avoid negative consequences for ocean ecosystems and human well being. 1693:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Concerns over fishing impacts on marine populations and ecosystems have intensified the need to improve ocean management. One increasingly popular market based instrument for ecological stewardship is the use of certification and eco labeling programs to highlight sustainable fisheries with low environmental impacts. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is the most prominent of these programs. Despite widespread discussions about the rigor of the MSC standards no comprehensive analysis of the performance of MSC certified fish stocks has yet been conducted. We compared status and abundance trends of 45 certified stocks with those of 179 uncertified stocks finding that 74 PeRcEnT of certified fisheries were above biomass levels that would produce maximum sustainable yield compared with only 44 PeRcEnT of uncertified fisheries. On average the biomass of certified stocks increased by 46 PeRcEnT over the past 10 years whereas uncertified fisheries increased by just 9 PeRcEnT. As part of the MSC process fisheries initially go through a confidential pre assessment process. When certified fisheries are compared with those that decline to pursue full certification after pre assessment certified stocks had much lower mean exploitation rates (67 PeRcEnT of the rate producing maximum sustainable yield vs. 92 PeRcEnT for those declining to pursue certification) allowing for more sustainable harvesting and in many cases biomass rebuilding. From a consumers point of view this means that MSC certified seafood is 3 5 times less likely to be subject to harmful fishing than uncertified seafood. Thus MSC certification accurately identifies healthy fish stocks and conveys reliable information on stock status to seafood consumers. 1695:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Effective conservation requires rigorous baselines of pristine conditions to assess the impacts of human activities and to evaluate the efficacy of management. Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change hence it is difficult to separate local from global effects. To this end we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top heavy). In contrast the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming. 1696:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Establishing different types of conservation zones is becoming commonplace. However spatial prioritization methods that can accommodate multiple zones are poorly understood in theory and application. It is typically assumed that management regulations across zones have differential levels of effectiveness (  zone effectiveness  ) for biodiversity protection but the influence of zone effectiveness on achieving conservation targets has not yet been explored. Here we consider the zone effectiveness of three zones: permanent closure partial protection and open for planning for the protection of five different marine habitats in the Vatu i Ra Seascape Fiji. We explore the impact of differential zone effectiveness on the location and costs of conservation priorities. We assume that permanent closure zones are fully effective at protecting all habitats open zones do not contribute towards the conservation targets and partial protection zones lie between these two extremes. We use four different estimates for zone effectiveness and three different estimates for zone cost of the partial protection zone. To enhance the practical utility of the approach we also explore how much of each traditional fishing ground can remain open for fishing while still achieving conservation targets. Our results show that all of the high priority areas for permanent closure zones would not be a high priority when the zone effectiveness of the partial protection zone is equal to that of permanent closure zones. When differential zone effectiveness and costs are considered the resulting marine protected area network consequently increases in size with more area allocated to permanent closure zones to meet conservation targets. By distributing the loss of fishing opportunity equitably among local communities we find that 84 88 PeRcEnT of each traditional fishing ground can be left open while still meeting conservation targets. Finally we summarize the steps for developing marine zoning that accounts for zone effectiveness. 16:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Based on an earlier published ecosystem model we have explored possible effects of different management scenarios for the Baltic Sea. The scenarios include an oligotrophication of the system a drastic increase in the number of seals and changes in the fishery management. From these simulations we conclude that fisheries seals and eutrophication all have strong and interacting impacts on the ecosystem. These interactions call for integrated management. The modelling highlights the potential for conflicts among management mandates such as flourishing fisheries rebuilt seal populations and substantially reduced eutrophication. The results also suggest that fisheries management reference points have to be adjusted in response to changes in the presence of natural predators or ecosystem productivity. 1700:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Management of marine ecosystems requires spatial information on current impacts. In several marine regions including the Mediterranean and Black Sea legal mandates and agreements to implement ecosystem based management and spatial plans provide new opportunities to balance uses and protection of marine ecosystems. Analyses of the intensity and distribution of cumulative impacts of human activities directly connected to the ecological goals of these policy efforts are critically needed. Quantification and mapping of the cumulative impact of 22 drivers to 17 marine ecosystems reveals that 20 PeRcEnT of the entire basin and 60 99 PeRcEnT of the territorial waters of EU member states are heavily impacted with high human impact occurring in all ecoregions and territorial waters. Less than 1 PeRcEnT of these regions are relatively unaffected. This high impact results from multiple drivers rather than one individual use or stressor with climatic drivers (increasing temperature and UV and acidification) demersal fishing ship traffic and in coastal areas pollution from land accounting for a majority of cumulative impacts. These results show that coordinated management of key areas and activities could significantly improve the condition of these marine ecosystems. 1701:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many hope that ocean waves will be a source for clean safe reliable and affordable energy yet wave energy conversion facilities may affect marine ecosystems through a variety of mechanisms including competition with other human uses. We developed a decision support tool to assist siting wave energy facilities which allows the user to balance the need for profitability of the facilities with the need to minimize conflicts with other ocean uses. Our wave energy model quantifies harvestable wave energy and evaluates the net present value (NPV) of a wave energy facility based on a capital investment analysis. The model has a flexible framework and can be easily applied to wave energy projects at local regional and global scales. We applied the model and compatibility analysis on the west coast of Vancouver Island British Columbia Canada to provide information for ongoing marine spatial planning including potential wave energy projects. In particular we conducted a spatial overlap analysis with a variety of existing uses and ecological characteristics and a quantitative compatibility analysis with commercial fisheries data. We found that wave power and harvestable wave energy gradually increase offshore as wave conditions intensify. However areas with high economic potential for wave energy facilities were closer to cable landing points because of the cost of bringing energy ashore and thus in nearshore areas that support a number of different human uses. We show that the maximum combined economic benefit from wave energy and other uses is likely to be realized if wave energy facilities are sited in areas that maximize wave energy NPV and minimize conflict with existing ocean uses. Our tools will help decision makers explore alternative locations for wave energy facilities by mapping expected wave energy NPV and helping to identify sites that provide maximal returns yet avoid spatial competition with existing ocean uses. 1708:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The concept of biodiversity offsets is well established as an approach to environmental management. The concept has been suggested for environmental management in fisheries particularly in relation to the substantial numbers of non target species seabirds in particular caught and killed as incidental bycatch during fishing activities. Substantial areas of fisheries are being closed to protect these species at great cost to the fishing industry. However other actions may be taken to offset the impact of fishing on these populations at lower cost to the fishing industry. This idea however has attracted severe criticism largely as it does not address the underlying externality problems created by the fishing sector namely seabird fishing mortality. In this paper we re examine the potential role of compensatory mitigation as a fisheries management tool although from the perspective of being an interim management measure while more long lasting solutions to the problem are found. We re model an example previously examined by both proponents and opponents of the approach namely the cost effectiveness of rodent control relative to fishery area closures for the conservation of a seabird population adversely affected by an Australian tuna fishery. We find that in the example being examined invasive rodent eradication is at least 10 times more cost effective than area closures. We conclude that while this does not solve the actual bycatch problem it may provide breathing space for both the seabird species and the industry to find longer term means of reducing bycatch. 1709:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is considerable variability in the status of fish populations around the world and a poor understanding of how specific management characteristics affect populations. Overfishing is a major problem in many fisheries but in some regions the recent tendency has been to exploit stocks at levels below their maximum sustainable yield. In Western North American groundfish fisheries the status of individual stocks and management systems among regions are highly variable. In this paper we show the current status of groundfish stocks from Alaska British Columbia and the U. S. West Coast and quantify the influence on stock status of six management tactics often hypothesized to affect groundfish. These tactics are: the use of harvest control rules with estimated biological reference points; seasonal closures; marine reserves; bycatch constraints; individual quotas  catch shares); and gear type. Despite the high commercial value of many groundfish and consequent incentives for maintaining stocks at their most productive levels most stocks were managed extremely conservatively with current exploitation rates at only 40 PeRcEnT of management targets and biomass 33 PeRcEnT above target biomass on average. Catches rarely exceeded TACs but on occasion were far below TACs (mean catch: TAC ratio of 57 PeRcEnT); approximately  DoLlQuAnT 150 million of potential landed value was foregone annually by underutilizing TACs. The use of individual quotas marine reserves and harvest control rules with estimated limit reference points had little overall effect on stock status. More valuable fisheries were maintained closer to management targets and were less variable over time than stocks with lower catches or ex vessel prices. Together these results suggest there is no single effective management measure for meeting conservation objectives; if scientifically established quotas are set and enforced a variety of means can be used to ensure that exploitation rates and biomass levels are near to or more conservative than management targets. 1721:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A perceived recent increase in global jellyfish abundance has been portrayed as a symptom of degraded oceans. This perception is based primarily on a few case studies and anecdotal evidence but a formal analysis of global temporal trends in jellyfish populations has been missing. Here we analyze all available long term datasets on changes in jellyfish abundance across multiple coastal stations using linear and logistic mixed models and effect size analysis to show that there is norobust evidence for a global increase in jellyfish. Although there has been a small linear increase in jellyfish since the 1970s this trend was unsubstantiated by effect size analysis that showed no difference in the proportion of increasing vs. decreasing jellyfish populations over all time periods examined. Rather the strongest nonrandom trend indicated jellyfish populations undergo larger worldwide oscillations with an approximate 20 y periodicity including a rising phase during the 1990s that contributed to the perception of a global increase in jellyfish abundance. Sustained monitoring is required over the next decade to elucidate with statistical confidence whether the weak increasing linear trend in jellyfish after 1970 is an actual shift in the baseline or part of an oscillation. Irrespective of the nature of increase given the potential damage posed by jellyfish blooms to fisheries tourism and other human industries our findings foretell recurrent phases of rise and fall in jellyfish populations that society should be prepared to face. 1722:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A recurring pattern of declining mean trophic level of fisheries landings termed   fishing down the food web    is thought to be indicative of the serial replacement of high trophic level fisheries with less valuable low trophic level fisheries as the former become depleted to economic extinction. An alternative to this view that declining mean trophic levels indicate the serial addition of low trophic level fisheries (  fishing through the food web  ) may be equally severe because it ultimately leads to conflicting demands for ecosystem services. By analyzing trends in fishery landings in 48 large marine ecosystems worldwide we find that fishing down the food web was pervasive (present in 30 ecosystems) but that the sequential addition mechanism was by far the most common one underlying declines in the mean trophic level of landings. Specifically only 9 ecosystems showed declining catches of upper trophic level species compared with 21 ecosystems that exhibited either no significant change (n equals 6) or significant increases (n equals 15) in upper trophic level catches when fishing down the food web was occurring. Only in the North Atlantic were ecosystems regularly subjected to sequential collapse and replacement of fisheries. We suggest that efforts to promote sustainable use of marine resources will benefit from a fuller consideration of all processes giving rise to fishing down the food web. 1725:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coastal ecosystems and the services they provide are adversely affected by a wide variety of human activities. In particular seagrass meadows are negatively affected by impacts accruing from the billion or more people who live within 50 km of them. Seagrass meadows provide important ecosystem services including an estimated  DoLlQuAnT 1.9 trillion per year in the form of nutrient cycling; an order of magnitude enhancement of coral reef fish productivity; a habitat for thousands of fish bird and invertebrate species; and a major food source for endangered dugong manatee and green turtle. Although individual impacts from coastal development degraded water quality and climate change have been documented there has been no quantitative global assessment of seagrass loss until now. Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km(2) yr( 1) since 1980 and that 29 PeRcEnT of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879. Furthermore rates of decline have accelerated from a median of 0.9 PeRcEnT yr( 1) before 1940 to 7 PeRcEnT yr( 1) since 1990. Seagrass loss rates are comparable to those reported for mangroves coral reefs and tropical rainforests and place seagrass meadows among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. 1731:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fish stocks fluctuate both in abundance and productivity (net population increase) and there are many examples demonstrating that productivity increased or decreased due to changes in abundance caused by fishing and alternatively where productivity shifted between low and high regimes entirely unrelated to abundance. Although shifts in productivity regimes have been described their frequency and intensity have not previously been assessed. We use a database of trends in harvest and abundance of 230 fish stocks to evaluate the proportion of fish stocks in which productivity is primarily related to abundance vs. those that appear to manifest regimes of high or low productivity. We evaluated the statistical support for four hypotheses: (i) the abundance hypothesis where production is always related to population abundance; (ii) the regimes hypothesis where production shifts irregularly between regimes that are unrelated to abundance; (iii) the mixed hypothesis where even though production is related to population abundance there are irregular changes in this relationship; and (iv) the random hypothesis where production is random from year to year. We found that the abundance hypothesis best explains 18.3 PeRcEnT of stocks the regimes hypothesis 38.6 PeRcEnT the mixed hypothesis 30.5 PeRcEnT and the random hypothesis 12.6 PeRcEnT. Fisheries management agencies need to recognize that irregular changes in productivity are common and that harvest regulation and management targets may need to be adjusted whenever productivity changes. 1737:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Humans transformed Western Atlantic coastal marine ecosystems before modern ecological investigations began Paleoecological. archeological and historical reconstructions demonstrate incredible losses of large vertebrates and oysters from the entire Atlantic coast. Untold millions of large fishes sharks sea turtles and manatees were removed from the Caribbean in the 17th to 19th centuries. Recent collapses of reef corals and seagrasses are due ultimately to losses of these large consumers as much as to more recent changes in climate eutrophication or outbreaks of disease. Overfishing in the 19th century reduced vast beds of oysters in Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries to a few percent of pristine abundances and promoted eutrophication. Mechanized harvesting of bottom fishes like cod set off a series of trophic cascades that eliminated kelp forests and then brought them back again as fishers fished their way down food webs to small invertebrates. Lastly but most pervasively mechanized harvesting df the entire continental shelf decimated large long lived fishes and destroyed three dimensional habitats built up by sessile corals bryozoans and sponges. The universal pattern of losses demonstrates that no coastal ecosystem is pristine and few wild fisheries are sustainable along the entire Western Atlantic coast. Reconstructions of ecosystems lost only a century or two ago demonstrate attainable goals of establishing large and effective marine reserves if society is willing to pay the costs. Historical reconstructions provide a new scientific framework for manipulative experiments at the ecosystem scale to explore the feasibility and benefits of protection of our living coastal resources. 1748:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine reserves are increasingly recognized as having linked social and ecological dynamics. This study investigates how the ecological performance of 56 marine reserves throughout the Philippines Caribbean and Western Indian Ocean (WIO) is related to both reserve design features and the socioeconomic characteristics in associated coastal communities. Ecological performance was measured as fish biomass in the reserve relative to nearby areas. Of the socioeconomic variables considered human population density and compliance with reserve rules had the strongest effects on fish biomass but the effects of these variables were region specific. Relationships between population density and the reserve effect on fish biomass were negative in the Caribbean positive in the WIO and not detectable in the Philippines. Differing associations between population density and reserve effectiveness defy simple explanation but may depend on human migration to effective reserves depletion of fish stocks outside reserves or other social factors that change with population density. Higher levels of compliance reported by resource users was related to higher fish biomass in reserves compared with outside but this relationship was only statistically significant in the Caribbean. A heuristic model based on correlations between social cultural political economic and other contextual conditions in 127 marine reserves showed that high levels of compliance with reserve rules were related to complex social interactions rather than simply to enforcement of reserve rules. Comparative research of this type is important for uncovering the complexities surrounding human dimensions of marine reserves and improving reserve management. 175:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Brazil is one of the five leading exporting countries of tropical aquarium fishes in the world and the interest in marine ornamental organisms has increased substantially there from the mid to the late 1990s. About 120 reef fish species are currently harvested in Brazils ornamental trade. Among the 75 most harvested species 26 (34.7 PeRcEnT) are endemic eight (10.7 PeRcEnT) are rare and six (8.2 PeRcEnT) are estuarine dependent species. Fifty five species (75.3 PeRcEnT) have complex reproductive strategies and or parental care. In quantitative terms the top 10 species comprises 62 PeRcEnT of the species exported from Brazil to the USA and the European Community. The most harvested reef invertebrates include about 65 species. The most representative groups are crustaceans with 15 species (23 PeRcEnT) and molluscs and stony corals with 10 species (15.4 PeRcEnT) each. Among these 15 (23 PeRcEnT) are endemics nine (13.8 PeRcEnT) are rare species and seven (10.8 PeRcEnT) are important reef builders. A case of local extinction of the giant anemone Condylactis gigantea is reported. To alleviate ecological impacts a series of urgent measures is suggested including the creation of specific laws for marine ornamental harvesting and improving law enforcement to prevent illegal trade in Brazil. 1765:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Successful ocean management needs to consider not only fishing impacts but drivers of harvest. Consolidating post 1950 global catch and economic data we assess which attributes of fisheries are good indicators for fishery development. Surprisingly year of development and economic value are not correlated with fishery trophic levels. Instead patterns emerge of profit driven fishing for attributes related to costs and revenues. Post 1950 fisheries initially developed on shallow ranging species with large catch high price and big body size and then expanded to less desirable species. Revenues expected from developed fisheries declined 95 PeRcEnT from 1951 to 1999 and few high catch or valuable fishing opportunities remain. These results highlight the importance of economic attributes of species as leading indicators for harvest related impacts in ocean ecosystems. 1771:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The rapid increase in the science and implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the world in the past 15 years is now being followed by similar increases in the science and application of marine ecosystem based management (EBM). Despite important overlaps and some common goals these two approaches have remained either separated in the literature and in conservation and management efforts or treated as if they are one and the same. In the cases when connections are acknowledged there is often little assessment of if or how well MPAs can achieve specific EBM goals. Here we start by critically evaluating commonalities and differences between MPAs and EBM. Next we use global analyses to show where and how much no take marine reserves can be expected to contribute to EBM goals specifically by reducing the cumulative impacts of stressors on ocean ecosystems. These analyses revealed large stretches of coastal oceans where reserves can play a major role in reducing cumulative impacts and thus improving overall ocean condition at the same time highlighting the limitations of marine reserves as a single tool to achieve comprehensive EBM. Ultimately better synergies between these two burgeoning approaches provide opportunities to greatly benefit ocean health. 1772:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The science of spatial fisheries management which combines ecology oceanography and economics has matured significantly. As a result there have been recent advances in exploiting spatially explicit data to develop spatially explicit management policies such as networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). However when data are sparse spatially explicit policies become less viable and we must instead rely on blunt policies such as total allowable catches or imprecisely configured networks of MPAs. Therefore spatial information has the potential to change management approaches and thus has value. We develop a general framework within which to analyze the value of information for spatial fisheries management and apply that framework to several US Pacific coast fisheries. We find that improved spatial information can increase fishery value significantly ( 10 PeRcEnT in our simulations) and that it changes dramatically the efficient management approach switching from diffuse effort everywhere to a strategy where fishing is spatially targeted with some areas under intensive harvest and others closed to fishing. Using all available information even when incomplete is essential to management success and may as much as double fishery value relative to using (admittedly incorrect) assumptions commonly invoked. 1776:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article examines two strands of discourse on wild capture fisheries; one that focuses on resource sustainability and environmental impacts another related to food and nutrition security and human well being. Available data and research show that for countries most dependent on fish to meet the nutritional requirements of their population wild capture fisheries remain the dominant supplier. Although contrary to popular narratives the sustainability of these fisheries is not always and everywhere in crisis securing their sustainability is essential and requires considerable effort across a broad spectrum of fishery systems. An impediment to achieving this is that the current research and policy discourses on environmental sustainability of fisheries and food security remain only loosely and superficially linked. Overcoming this requires adoption of a broader sustainability science paradigm to help harness synergies and negotiate tradeoffs between food security resource conservation and macroeconomic development goals. The way society chooses to govern fisheries is however an ethical choice not just a technical one and we recommend adding an ethical dimension to sustainability science as applied to fisheries. 1782:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding which species are most vulnerable to human impacts is a prerequisite for designing effective conservation strategies. Surveys of terrestrial species have suggested that large bodied species and top predators are the most at risk and it is commonly assumed that such patterns also apply in the ocean. However there has been no global test of this hypothesis in the sea. We analyzed two fisheries datasets (stock assessments and landings) to determine the life history traits of species that have suffered dramatic population collapses. Contrary to expectations our data suggest that up to twice as many fisheries for small low trophic level species have collapsed compared with those for large predators. These patterns contrast with those on land suggesting fundamental differences in the ways that industrial fisheries and land conversion affect natural communities. Even temporary collapses of small low trophic level fishes can have ecosystem wide impacts by reducing food supply to larger fish seabirds and marine mammals. 1807:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Management and conservation can be greatly informed by considering explicitly how environmental factors influence population genetic structure. Using simulated larval dispersal estimates based on ocean current observations we demonstrate how explicit consideration of frequency of exchange of larvae among sites via ocean advection can fundamentally change the interpretation of empirical population genetic structuring as compared with conventional spatial genetic analyses. Both frequency of larval exchange and empirical genetic difference were uncorrelated with Euclidean distance between sites. When transformed into relative oceanographic distances and integrated into a genetic isolation by distance framework however the frequency of larval exchange explained nearly 50 per cent of the variance in empirical genetic differences among sites over scales of tens of kilometres. Explanatory power was strongest when we considered effects of multiple generations of larval dispersal via intermediary locations on the long term probability of exchange between sites. Our results uncover meaningful spatial patterning to population genetic structuring that corresponds with ocean circulation. This study advances our ability to interpret population structure from complex genetic data characteristic of high gene flow species validates recent advances in oceanographic approaches for assessing larval dispersal and represents a novel approach to characterize population connectivity at small spatial scales germane to conservation and fisheries management. 1826:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The risk of global extinction of reef building coral species is increasing. We evaluated extinction risk using a biological trait based resiliency index that was compared with Caribbean extinction during the Plio Pleistocene and with extinction risk determined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Through the Plio Pleistocene the Caribbean supported more diverse coral assemblages than today and shared considerable overlap with contemporary Indo Pacific reefs. A clear association was found between extant Plio Pleistocene coral genera and our positive resilience scores. Regional extinction in the past and vulnerability in the present suggests that Pocillopora Stylophora and foliose Pavona are among the most susceptible taxa to local and regional isolation. These same taxa were among the most abundant corals in the Caribbean Pliocene. Therefore a widespread distribution did not equate with immunity to regional extinction. The strong relationship between past and present vulnerability suggests that regional extinction events are trait based and not merely random episodes. We found several inconsistencies between our data and the IUCN scores which suggest a need to critically re examine what constitutes coral vulnerability. 1891:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Concern about the impact of fishing on ecosystems and fisheries production is increasing. Strategies to reduce these impacts while addressing the growing need for food security include increasing selectivity: capturing species sexes and sizes in proportions that differ from their occurrence in the ecosystem. Increasing evidence suggests that more selective fishing neither maximizes production nor minimizes impacts. Balanced harvesting would more effectively mitigate adverse ecological effects of fishing while supporting sustainable fisheries. This strategy which challenges present management paradigms distributes a moderate mortality from fishing across the widest possible range of species stocks and sizes in an ecosystem in proportion to their natural productivity so that the relative size and species composition is maintained. 1892:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, T. J. Goreau feels strongly that the primary cause of algal overgrowth of the coral reefs in Kaneohe Bay is eutrophication. We think he may have missed the point. While we agree that nutrient enrichment and overfishing are both important in causing algal blooms and coral algal phase shifts on reefs around the world including Kaneohe Bay in the 1970s the story today is much more complicated. First the species of algae targeted for removal by the Super Sucker are non native or alien species introduced to Kaneohe Bay for aquaculture research in the 1970s and have been growing unchecked since that time. These species are native to the western tropical Pacific and are cultivated for the carrageenan and agar industries in numerous areas covering thousands of hectares where eutrophication is not a problem. Second exotic species are considered one of the largest threats to global biodiversity where they alter ecosystem structure and function and cause substantial economic losses. The methods to remove alien algae from reefs in Kaneohe Bay were developed as a means to prevent or reduce negative effects of an invading species while buying time for the development of biological control methods with the native sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla. Preliminary data are encouraging as areas that have been cleared by the Super Sucker remain clear of alien algae and have increased coral recruitment after just 2 years. Third some introduced species are successful in new environments because they are competitively superior and because they have no natural predators. While nutrient enrichment can increase algal growth rates more recently published nutrient concentrations from across Kaneohe Bay have consistently reported values below Lapointes __threshold values.__ Other factors such as reduced herbivory are also clearly important but our data show that these algae are not preferred food sources for herbivorous fishes in Hawaii. Because these alien algae are able to grow in low nutrient environments and are not readily consumed by herbivorous fishes they may be able to spread to Hawaiis most pristine reefs. Given this we believe that it is our responsibility as scientists and conservation biologists to take action and help to prevent the death of yet another coral reef. 1894:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A key motivation for our research was to counteract the tendency to focus on single activities or single ecosystems when assessing the state of the oceans. Because we mapped cumulative impacts of 17 different stressors on 20 ecosystems cumulative impacts diverge substantially from expectations for single stressors or ecosystems in most locations. Our global map is particularly valuable because it allows different areas of the planet to be compared using the same currency. The poles while not pristine are areas of little cumulative impact relative to the rest of the worlds oceans according to our model. Blight and Ainley suggest that our maps for the Southern Ocean are misleading because they do not reflect current or historical levels of fishing. Had data for historical fishing been available globally and included many key areas of the worlds oceans  waters around Europe Asia and North America) would likely have also looked much worse on our map keeping the patches of blue near Antarctica in the lowest category of human impact. Moreover the nine stressors not related to commercial fishing and climate change are inarguably lower in the poles than elsewhere. Consequently our results are conservative not misleading. Ray . highlight a key challenge in mapping human impacts to marine ecosystems at the global scale: capturing dynamic processes on a static map. Sea ice is clearly an important ecosystem but its extent shows strong seasonal and annual variation far more than any other ecosystem precluding a clear solution for where to place it on the map. Ray . also point out that the loss of sea ice is an important driver of change but habitat loss and resulting species extirpations are problems shared by many ecosystem types  mangroves). Future efforts to refine our maps would benefit from incorporation of dynamic processes and may be able to better include historical data when conducted at local or regional scales. 1895:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) continues to rise so too does the amount of CO2 in the ocean which increases the oceans acidity. This affects marine ecosystems on a global scale in ways we are only beginning to understand: for example impairing the ability of organisms to form shells or skeletons altering food webs and negatively affecting economies dependent on services ranging from coral reef tourism to shellfish harvests to salmon fisheries. Although increasing anthropogenic inputs drive acidification at global scales local acidification disproportionately affects coastal ecosystems and the communities that rely on them. We describe policy options by which local and state governments__ as opposed to federal and international bodies__can reduce these local and regional hot spots of ocean acidification. Several studies document acidification hot spots patches of ocean water with significantly depressed pH levels relative to historical baselines occurring at spatial scales of tens to hundreds of square kilometers. These coastal hot spots may be due to nonuniform changes in circulation and biological processes and precipitation runoff in concert with globally increased atmospheric CO2. Local studies in the Kennebec River plume in the Gulf of Maine the Chesapeake Bay and the Manning River estuary in New South Wales Australia illustrate that freshwater inputs pollutants and soil erosion can acidify coastal waters at substantially higher rates than atmospheric CO2 alone. These nonatmospheric inputs can have particularly large consequences when they coincide with biotic phenomena spawning events or abiotic processes such as upwelling events that bring low pH water to near shore areas. Additional local phenomena__ such as sulfur dioxide precipitation hypoxia eutrophication and both emissions and runoff from acidic fertilizers__can intensify these localized hot spots. These impacts are likely to be magnified when combined with other stressors in the coastal ocean including overfishing habitat destruction temperature increases and nonacidifying pollution. Policy Recommendations As global and national efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions struggle to gain traction smaller scale actions become increasingly important. In the United States for example local and state governments have both the authority and motive to address many stressors that drive or exacerbate acidification conditions. This runs contrary to the widely held perception that acidification cannot be addressed at the scale of local  municipal and county) or regional (state multistate and territorial) jurisdictions. Although we focus here on U.S. policies similar legal tools exist elsewhere to guard against non CO2 acidification drivers. U.S. federal environmental laws  Clean Air Act Clean Water Act and Coastal Zone Management Act) state laws and local ordinances provide multiple layers of protection for coastal waters by controlling emissions runoff and land use patterns through zoning and permitting. Implementing measures that reduce residential and agricultural runoff for example can minimize beach and river contamination and algal blooms while reducing pollutants that acidify the local coastal ocean. Many states have already passed legislation to limit residential runoff although these are not specifically aimed at mitigating acidification. A recent lawsuit and the resulting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) memoranda illustrate states responsibilities to apply federal environmental laws to combat acidification in state waters. In Center for Biological Diversity v. EPA the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) challenged Washington States failure to designate coastal waters as impaired because of a decline in pH by 0.2 units from baseline levels as required under the federal Clean Water Act. Despite the lack of substantive reform of the National Water Quality Standard for marine pH owing to insufficient data the EPA highlighted the seriousness of acidifications impacts on ocean life and encouraged states to list pH impaired waters where data are available. A focus on data collection could lead to future regulatory revisions that allow state governments to better restrict pollutants in coastal waters. States may also use existing law to develop biological water quality standards for acidification to assess if a water body is impaired on the basis of biological indicators  negative impacts on coral species). Water quality standards and impairment designations however are only ecologically meaningful in light of baseline conditions vulnerability of ecosystems and thresholds for ecosystem change which are often undefined. Four Approaches Few jurisdictions have taken steps to mitigate acidification likely because of the combination of low awareness and a sense that the causes are globally diffuse. Four approaches have particular potential for combating locally intensified acidification. First the Clean Water Act directs state government agencies to ensure that precipitation runoff and associated pollutants (which can increase acidification) are monitored limited and consistent with the sustainable functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Stormwater surge prevention  holding tanks) coastal and riparian buffers (areas of vegetation near land water intersections) intact wetlands and improved onsite water treatment facilities are effective measures to address watershed runoff and associated pollutants. In many cases federal funding is available to help local governments complete these kinds of projects and local watershed groups provide a grassroots base for ensuring that states and EPA meet their responsibilities. Second controlling coastal erosion is a classic function of local and state governments and one that could markedly benefit coastal ecosystems by reducing nutrient and sediment loading of water and protecting the physical integrity of the habitat itself. Such coastal inputs may be enriched with fertilizers and if unchecked can further increase acidification in estuaries and coastal waterways. Independent local actions such as increasing vegetation cover may be effective at small scales but concerted action among multiple local jurisdictions__as would likely be necessary to address erosion within an entire watershed for example__may require coordination among state or regional governments adding a layer of regulatory complexity. Third land use change facilitated through local and regional planning zoning and permitting policies can reduce direct and indirect  deforestation) CO2 emissions runoff and other threats. Antisprawl land use plans can help reduce vehicle miles traveled and impermeable surface cover limiting both emissions and runoff. At least two state laws Massachusetts (Global Warming Solutions Act) and California (SB 375) explicitly link land use development transportation and climate change mitigation. These state level rules are models for state action but cities and counties can adopt policies and alter zoning provisions and general plans that could help safeguard their own waters__without waiting for state governments to act. Finally simply enforcing existing federal emissions limits for pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide (for example from coal fired power plants) could help ameliorate local drivers of ocean acidification. Reductions could have immediate local effects because these pollutants have short atmospheric residence times falling out of the atmosphere and into the water and or land near where they were produced. Reducing pollutants to benefit local environmental conditions increases the likelihood of responsible stewardship by matching political incentives and environmental remediation at the same spatial scale. In addition to regulating inputs to the coastal zone protecting important ecosystem components (such as shell material) provides another potential mechanism to combat locally intensified acidification. Returning crushed shell material to coastal habitats to approximate densities found in healthy clam populations can substantially increase pH and mitigate localized acidification impacts on clams. Tenaciously enforcing existing limits for sediment runoff erosion and emissions may alone improve the health of coastal waters and safeguard coastal economies dependent on calcium carbonate producing organisms such as shellfish and corals. In the face of declining conditions however it is increasingly critical to establish historical and current pH levels to inform future federal or state regulations aimed at protecting against ocean acidification. The potential biological ecological and socioeconomic effects of acidification are likely to affect near shore environments most severely affecting the delivery of ecosystem services that over half of the worlds population depend on and costing billions of dollars in lost product and income. Minimizing additional stressors on coastal ecosystems can also help to ameliorate threats to coastal resources thereby maintaining ecosystem resilience and sustainable economic benefits from the ocean. 1896:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coral reefs provide ecosystem goods and services worth more than  DoLlQuAnT 375 billion to the global economy each year. Yet worldwide reefs are in decline. Examination of the history of degradation reveals three ways to challenge the current state of affairs. First scientists should stop arguing about the relative importance of different causes of coral reef decline: overfishing pollution disease and climate change. Instead we must simultaneously reduce all threats to have any hope of reversing the decline. Second the scale of coral reef management__with mechanisms such as protected areas__ has been too small and piecemeal. Reefs must be managed as entire ecosystems. Third a lack of clear conservation goals has limited our ability to define or measure success. Large animals like turtles sharks and groupers were once abundant on all coral reefs and large long lived corals created a complex architecture supporting diverse fish and invertebrates. Today the most degraded reefs are little more than rubble seaweed and slime. Almost no large animals survive water quality is poor and large corals are dead or dying and being replaced by weedy corals soft corals and seaweed. Overfishing of megafauna releases population control of smaller fishes and invertebrates creating booms and busts. This in turn can increase algal overgrowth or overgrazing and stress the coral architects likely making them more vulnerable to other forms of stress. This linked sequence of events is remarkably consistent worldwide (see top figure this page). Even on Australias Great Barrier Reef (GBR) the largest and best managed reef in the world decline is ongoing. Australias strategy beginning with the vision to establish the worlds largest marine park in 1976 is based on coordinated management at large spatial scales. Recently more than one third of the GBR was zoned no take and new laws and policies to reduce pollution and fishing are in place. Evaluating benefits of increased no take zones will require detailed follow up but smaller scale studies elsewhere support increased protection. Two neighboring countries the Bahamas and Cuba have also committed to conserve more than 20 PeRcEnT of their coral reef ecosystems. By contrast the Florida Keys and main Hawaiian Islands are far further down the trajectory of decline yet much less action has been taken. What is the United States doing to enhance its coral reef assets? In the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary the Governor and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) agreed in 1997 to incorporate zoning with protection from fishing and water quality controls. But only 6 PeRcEnT of the Sanctuary is zoned no take and these zones are not strategically located. Conversion of 16 000 cesspools to centralized sewage treatment and control of other land based pollution have only just begun. Floridas reefs are well over halfway toward ecological extinction and much more impaired than reefs of Belize and all but one of the Pacific reefs in the figure below. Large predatory fishes continue to decrease reefs are increasingly dominated by seaweed and alarming diseases have emerged. Annual revenues from reef tourism are  DoLlQuAnT 1.6 billion but the economic future of the Keys is gloomy owing to accelerating ecological degradation. Why? Without a clear goal for recovery development and ratification of the management plan became a goal in itself. Reefs of the northwest Hawaiian Islands have been partially protected by isolation from the main Hawaiian Islands (which show degradation similar to that of the Florida Keys) and are in relatively good condition. Corals are healthy and the average biomass of commercially important large predators such as sharks jacks and groupers is 65 times as great as that at Oahu Hawaii Maui and Kauai. Even in the northwestern islands however there are signs of decline. Monk seals and green turtles are endangered; large amounts of marine debris are accumulating which injure or kill corals seabirds mammals turtles and fishes; and levels of contaminants including lead and PCBs are high. Until recently small scale impacts from overfishing and pollution could be managed locally but thermal stress and coral bleaching are already changing community structure of reefs. Impacts of climate change may depend critically on the extent to which a reef is already degraded. Polluted and overfished reefs like in Jamaica and Florida have failed to recover from bouts of bleaching and their corals have been replaced by seaweed. We believe that restoring food webs and controlling eutrophication provides a first line of defense against climate change; however slowing or reversing global warming trends is essential for the long term health of all tropical coral reefs. For too long single actions such as making a plan reducing fishing or pollution or conserving a part of the system were viewed as goals. But only combined actions addressing all these threats will achieve the ultimate goal of reversing the trajectory of decline (see the table above). We need to act now to curtail processes adversely affecting reefs. Stopping overfishing will require integrated systems of no take areas and quotas to restore key functional groups. Terrestrial runoff of nutrients sediments and toxins must be greatly reduced by wiser land use and coastal development. Reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases are needed to reduce coral bleaching and disease. Progress on all fronts can be measured by comparison with the past ecosystem state through the methods of historical ecology to determine whether or not we are succeeding in ameliorating or reversing decline. Sequential return of key groups such as parrot fish and sea urchins that graze down seaweed; mature stands of corals that create forest like complexity; and sharks turtles large jacks and groupers that maintain a more stable food web constitutes success. This consistent way of measuring recovery and the possibility of short term gains set a benchmark for managing other marine ecosystems. Like any other successful business managing coral reefs requires investment in infrastructure. Hence we also need more strategic interventions to restore species that provide key ecological functions. For example green turtles and sea cows not only once helped maintain healthy seagrass ecosystems but also were an important source of high quality protein for coastal communities. Our vision of how to reverse the decline of U.S. reefs rests on addressing all threats simultaneously (see the table above). By active investment major changes can be achieved through practical solutions with short and long term benefits. Short lived species like lobster conch and aquarium fish will recover and generate income in just a few years and benefits will continue to compound over time. Longer lived species will recover water quality will improve and the ecosystem will be more resilient to unforeseen future threats. Ultimately we will have increased tourism and the possibility of renewed sustainable extraction of abundant megafauna. One day reefs of the United States could be the pride of the nation. 1899:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Feagin raises an excellent question but misunderstands our findings on the wave attenuation function of key coastal interface systems. The wave attenuation shown in fig. S1A can be attributed nearly entirely to mangrove vegetation. As we explain in the Reports Supporting Online Material this figure for attenuation of swells with 5 to 8 s periods on the Vietnam coast is based on a field study of a mangrove swamp with various tree sizes fronted by an intertidal shoal. Small outer mangroves had almost no effect on wave heights of 0.9 m but passage through taller denser mangroves inshore reduced wave height to between 0.05 and 0.1 m. The 90 PeRcEnT reduction in wave height as shown in fig. S1A occurred across a wide tidal flat (gradient 0.5 1000 m) and is attributed to the extent and structure of the vegetation rather than to topographic changes. We show similar results for salt marshes with wave height declining exponentially with the distance that the vegetation extends inland from the shoreline. Contrary to Feagins assertion we do not argue that the storm protection value of mangroves or any other coastal interface system relies solely on vegetation as a buffer against extreme events such as tsunamis or hurricanes; in fact we suggest otherwise in our Supporting Online Material. We agree with Feagin that mangroves are unlikely to stop a tsunami wave larger than 6 m as ecohydrological studies have shown. Wave attenuation by mangroves is qualitatively different for large infrequent disturbances such as tsunamis hurricanes (typhoons) and tidal bores compared with small frequent disturbances such as tropical storms coastal floods and tidal waves. Yet even with respect to extremely large events such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami mangroves may act as natural barriers to some degree. Finally the storm protection value of mangroves used in our Report was estimated from 39 economically damaging coastal storm events from 1975 to 2004 affecting one or more of the 21 coastal provinces of Southern Thailand. Of these events only four could be considered extreme storm events: three typhoons and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Moreover the frequency of smaller storm events appears to be increasing; between 1975 and 1987 Thailand experienced on average 0.54 coastal natural disasters per year. Between 1987 and 2004 the incidence increased to 1.83 disasters per year. It is against these small frequent and economically damaging events that we are likely to see mangroves and other coastal interface habitats offer the greatest benefit in terms of storm protection which tends to vary nonlinearly with habitat attributes.  1903:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Halpern . used a quantitative method to assess the cumulative impact of human activities across 20 ocean ecosystems. We agree with Heath that the impacts of activities can fall outside the bounds of their footprints of occurrence but we contend that in most cases the majority of the impact at the ecosystem level is concentrated at the site of the activitys footprint. Although increased accuracy in representing the true spatial distribution and scale of impacts is an important task it is probably a less urgent priority for the marine science community than improving global ecosystem distribution data especially for intertidal and near shore ecosystems and developing high resolution maps of many human activities poorly captured by our cumulative impact map such as illegal fishing historical fishing and sewage input. Using mackerel as an example Heath demonstrates that the consequences of catching migratory species will be felt beyond the site of capture  spawning grounds feeding grounds and inshore nursery areas juvenile habitats).We have three points of clarification on this issue: First the large scale of the commercial fisheries data (half degree reporting blocks) may partially account for impacts of the activity beyond its direct footprint although not in an informed way. Second at least in the case of mackerel details of our methodology actually account for a more even distribution of impact compared with the spatial unevenness in catch rates. We log transformed each driver data set which flattened the distribution of fishing intensity and normalized each point against the global maximum which for mackerel likely produced a fairly even impact across the species range because there is at least some level of catch across the entire range. A similar situation likely exists for many other migratory fish species in the fisheries data sets we used. Without a formal analysis of exactly where the ecological effects of mackerel fishing are greatest it is hard to argue for a further manipulation of the distribution of fishing impact. Third the pelagic low by catch fishing driver category to which most mackerel catch and 90 other taxa belong shows a broad footprint across the globe. Large swaths of maximum value in the North Atlantic Baltic and tropical eastern Pacific occur at scales matching the range of mackerel and other migratory taxa which suggests that little would change if details on migration patterns of a few species were added. Heath also suggested that our use of productivity to adjust the impact of catch rates does not account for the patterns of species movement addressed above and focuses on a scale that is likely smaller than what is relevant to ecological impacts of catch. Although this treatment is perhaps inadequate for many fisheries specific analyses as one of 17 data layers in a global scale analysis it adequately captures the fact we feel that the ecological impact of catch level partly depends on local productivity. Bottom up linkages between primary productivity and fisheries catch have been demonstrated around the world at various scales. The spatial scale at which annual mean primary productivity varies is larger than the half degree scale of the fishing blocks often by several times. We used a 5 year mean of productivity averaged within a moving window to smooth local variability even more and avoid spatial artifact. Highly migratory species highlight the challenge of representing cumulative impacts on the most appropriate scale because that scale will differ for various components of the ecosystem. Heath rightly points out that just because activities can be mapped on a 1 km2 scale does not mean that impact varies at 1 km2. We agree but also note that mapping impact at 1 km2 does not force it to vary at 1 km2; in most cases the intensity of human activities ecosystems and impact vary at larger scales. We intended the fine scale of our maps to provide spatial detail to managers and policymakers on where boundaries between ecosystems vulnerability and activities occur. As we originally noted the global map is best used for broad comparisons among regions and global priority setting. The type of detailed data on variation in species habitat uses the influence of productivity on catches and cascading impacts that Heath mentions would be better suited to local and regional scale analyses that apply our framework to a tailored list of relevant drivers vulnerability weights and higher resolution and or higher quality data on drivers and habitats. In the meantime those using the global results to assess impacts on a region should not overlook activities located outside the regions boundaries that may affect important high dispersal or migratory species. Visualizing the patterns of overlap in human activities allows us to find ways of using our oceans and its resources more effectively and efficiently by minimizing new impact where it is already greatest and protecting the few areas that are still relatively unused. Lessons learned at smaller spatial scales about the need for streamlining and integrating multiple disparate and noninteracting management institutions to confront the cumulative impacts and consider all sources of stress to a management region are further supported at the global scale. We are grateful to Heath for this opportunity to clarify our work. 1906:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Murawski and colleagues state that our assessment of the impacts of global marine biodiversity loss is overly pessimistic. They imply that management interventions are likely to reverse current trends of overfishing and that the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has already met that goal. They cite Georges Bank haddock as an example and contest that catch metrics (as used in our global analysis) are sufficient to track the status of this particular fish stock and possibly others. We agree that precise biomass data are preferable but these are rarely available. Here we illustrate that catches are a good proxy of the status of haddock although there can be a short delay in detecting recovery under intense management. While NMFSs own data show that full recovery is still uncommon ( 5 PeRcEnT of overfished stocks) (1) we strongly agree that destructive trends can be turned around and that rebuilding efforts need to be intensified to meet that goal. But we must not miss the forest for the trees: Continuing focus on single well assessed economically viable species will leave most of the oceans declining biodiversity under the radar. The Georges Bank example illustrates well how intensive management can reverse the loss of marine biodiversity and ecosystem services and was in fact included in our own recovery analysis. Haddock stocks collapsed from foreign overfishing in the 1960s and from domestic fleets in the 1980s. The first collapse was reversed by establishing a 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone in 1977 the second by an emergency closure of half of the fishing grounds in 1994. Haddock biomass increased promptly in both cases and catches followed with a 1 to 6 year delay (panel A of figure) indicating that fishing became again economically viable. The importance of large scale protected areas for such unprecedented recovery is well documented. The definition of collapse we used refers to a loss in catches of 90 PeRcEnT below the historic maximum. According to this metric the Georges Bank haddock stock or more precisely the ecosystem service it supplied collapsed from 1970 to 1977 and 1983 to 2003 (panel A of figure). Using stock assessment data from NMFS we find that stock biomass similarly collapsed from 1970 to 1977 and from 1982 to 1997. The stock biomass was considered overfished under NMFS rules from 1967 to 2002 and in 2004. Thus available data suggest that catch records tracked biomass changes overfishing status and stock collapses reasonably well (linear regression; catch against biomass 1963 to 2004; r equals 0.90 P   0.0001). By 2004 catches had increased to  10 PeRcEnT of the maximum or recovered by our definition. This example implies that use of stock biomass data (as opposed to catch data) would not change our overall conclusions. The Georges Bank example is built on some of the best fisheries data in the world and on effective but still uncommon management practices. In our global analysis we could obviously not rely on precise stock assessments available only for a fraction of the worlds fisheries. Even in the United States half of the 903 species recognized by fisheries management are not assessed because of data gaps and out of the 74 species that are assessed as overfished 34 still experience further overfishing while only 3 have recovered. Murawski . imply that if we had used a different metric of collapse or had access to global stock abundance data we would not have seen the steady decline in fisheries stocks that our analysis revealed. They provide no reanalysis of global fisheries data and rely on a single positive example to suggest that the future of seafood is currently safe. Our paper concentrates on the ability of highdiversity ecosystems to support services such as fisheries catch and suggests that efforts to support natural levels of marine diversity will be a powerful force in preventing the seafood collapse of which we warned. We share the fervent hope of Murawski . that changes in fisheries management can help reverse this troubling trend and suggest that an honest recognition of the global problems we face combined with a comprehensive assessment of successes and solutions will be the best way forward. Hilborn also raises concerns about the use of catch data in our analysis and calls for demonstration that catch trends approximate fish stock abundance trends. Although measures of stock abundance are critically important to fishery management our study focused on the flows of goods and services from marine ecosystems to humankind; food supply was one of these critical services and fisheries catches are the appropriate metric in this context. Recent assessments of the status of world fisheries used different approaches and data sources yet they all reach pessimistic conclusions about the direction of global fisheries trends. For example Hilborn and co authors state that we anticipate further declines in abundance further loss of jobs and fishing communities and potential structural change to marine ecosystems. They used catches in the same way as we do to distinguish well managed abundant fisheries from failed depleted ones. Their landings indicator (current yield over maximum historic yield) ranges from 0.28 to 1 for well managed fisheries from 0 to 0.11 for depleted stocks and 0.14 for a recovering stock. Thus our cutoff for collapsed stocks at 0.1 seems well supported as suggested by others. Hilborn does not provide any documentation to substantiate the argument that stock abundance data (as opposed to catches) may show a pattern different to ours. When we compare the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organizations (FAO) assessments of world fisheries (available since 1974) with our catch trends the general magnitude of change appears similar. There is more variability in the FAO estimates as they are based on a smaller subset of fisheries those that have proper abundance data available. The fact that within the last 7 years both indices fall above the long term trend may be optimistically interpreted as an early sign of positive change. Hilborn asserts that we have disregarded recent management successes in some jurisdictions. We focused on the relationship between biodiversity and services not on fisheries management in our paper. The maintenance and restoration of biodiversity consistently emerge as our critical management recommendation; this is consistent with previous work on the importance of stock complexity. In the context of our study Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) provided a replicated experimental framework for studying recovery of biodiversity and services. We are not advocating the establishment of MPAs as the sole policy solution to resolving the problems of fisheries management. Rather we suggest that sustainable fisheries practices pollution control maintenance of essential habitats and creation of marine reserves all need to be part of a broader strategy to manage ocean ecosystems for their biodiversity and associated services. We fully support Hilborns call to create incentives for conservative harvest levels as part of that broader strategy. Briggs asks for clarification of some terminology. Although the term biodiversity is used in many ways it has been clearly defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity as the variability among living organisms from all sources including inter alia terrestrial marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species between species and of ecosystems. Our study focused on the variability within and between species. Briggs suggests that the term population loss would more accurately describe our study than biodiversity loss and felt that we mostly dealt with commercially valuable species. This is not the case. Our study concerns the accelerating loss of populations and species; both are essential elements of biodiversity. Briggs is further concerned about the role of species extinctions in coastal ecosystems. We do not refer to global but regional extinctions within the 12 estuarine and coastal ecosystems studied but these include several species that are now globally extinct. Local and regional extinctions are much more common than extinctions on a global scale and are relevant for considering the effects of diversity on ecosystem services because these are often provided at a local or regional level. In other words the ecosystem consequences of species loss occur long before global extinction. Finally Briggs is confused about our statement that an increased number of species invasions over time coincided with the loss of native biodiversity which he interpreted as invasions causing extinctions. However the reference we cited shows mechanistically that declining biodiversity can facilitate invasion and that diversity loss could be a contributing cause rather than a consequence of invasions in these systems. Briggs also suggests that invasions produce gains in biodiversity which in terms of simple number of species is correct. However we stated in our paper that invasions did not compensate for the loss of native biodiversity because they are comprised of other species groups. Briggs implies that biodiversity gains from invasions may enhance ecosystem services. This is an interesting idea. Although some invasive species may contribute to specific ecosystem services (such as invasive clams filtering the water of San Francisco Bay) there was no evidence in our study that invasions halted or reversed the marked loss 1907:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Our review is indeed about the deep historical roots of human degradation of a diverse suite of coastal marine ecosystems caused by and preconditioned by fishing exploitation and attendant damage to biogenic marine habitats. The novelty of our study lies in its use of multiple associated disciplines such as paleontology archaeology governmental record analysis and maritime natural history to provide ecological baselines of the past that long predate the formal discipline of ecology as it can be traced to Elton Lotka Park Birch and other early 20th century founders. Synthesis of such historical information for a variety of coastal marine ecosystems revealed a large impact of fishing and sea hunting that generally predated other human impacts independent of the system. If our review can be construed as arguing that restoring the overfished species and habitats degraded by fishing would be sufficient in themselves to counteract the deterioration of coastal marine ecosystems we apologize. No amount of success in restoring the sharks and sea turtles to remote coral reef ecosystems for example will counteract the growing impacts of coral bleaching induced by global warming and other physical causes. Furthermore we concur that reduction in nutrient loading to the worlds estuaries and coastal seas is a critical component of management strategies to restore lost ecosystem services and reverse eutrophication. Likewise if our narrative implies that fishing acts independently of other stressors we welcome this opportunity to reject such an interpretation. The synergistic interaction among multiple factors is the essence of our argument that impacts of historical fishing preconditioned many coastal ecosystems to subsequent collapse when later stressors were applied. For example the reduction in height of subtidal oyster reefs through incremental mining of shell matrix by dredge fishing in Chesapeake Bay and Pamlico Sound interacts with oxygen depletion of bottom waters and exposure to oyster disease to influence oyster health. Additionally restoring the extent and stature of oyster reefs in Chesapeake Bay and other bays worldwide is likely to restore substantial levels of water filtration even if oyster life spans are still shortened by disease because these reefs provide the unique hard substratum not only for the rapidly growing juvenile oysters but also for other epibiotic filter feeders like tunicates. Oyster reef restoration must be valued for ecosystem services to water quality and estuarine habitat even if restoration of traditional oyster fisheries is also a goal over a longer time frame. We prepared our review not to deny the impacts of other human activities on marine ecosystems but rather to document and emphasize the significance of fishing impacts upon apex consumers critical biogenic habitat engineers and important grazers that occurred so far in the past as to be often forgotten and ignored in restoration plans. Human induced extinctions in the marine environment have lagged behind those of terrestrial ecosystems so there still exists the biological potential with which to rebuild coastal marine ecosystems. We need to recognize these historical fishing impacts to appreciate the importance of apex consumer and grazer restoration in our integrated plans.  1908:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The decline of US coral reefs is a growing crisis that scientists have failed to communicate effectively to the public. For over 40 years research has implicated four major human causes of coral reef decline__ fishing land based pollution coastal development and global climate change__ and has identified their debilitating effects such as coral disease and coral bleaching. The relative importance of these different factors naturally varies from place to place and we agree that this is sometimes not obvious and may be important to resolve. The precautionary principle clearly dictates that we should not wait for conclusive evidence as to which of the four human disturbances has the biggest impact before action is taken. We will not obtain that evidence for many years or even decades. Nevertheless we can immediately reduce fishing land based pollution and coastal development; coping with climate change will require global action at the highest levels of government. Historical analysis provides a compelling picture of the problem of shifting baselines that lulls us into a false sense of security. Shifting baselines are especially problematic for places like the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and the Great Barrier Reef where many reefs are in comparatively good shape but significant threats remain. History also provides a clear roadmap for setting objective goals and criteria to assess the success of management options. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary management plan contains comprehensive strategies for addressing fishing land based pollution and coastal development. However we need to remember that the goal is not the drafting of a plan but rather the reversal of coral reef decline. Nearly 8 years after initiation of the plan only 6 PeRcEnT of the Florida Keys Sanctuary is fully protected from fishing and other extractive activities in marine reserves. This meager level of protection compares poorly with the 33 PeRcEnT protection afforded to the entire Great Barrier Reef which is in vastly better ecological condition. Moreover with the notable exception of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve reserves in the Keys are far too small to be effective. Water quality controls are contentious politically sensitive and expensive and the science concerning potential impacts of sewage based nutrients on coral reefs is often equivocal. In the Keys nutrient issues have been confounded by potential offshore nutrient sources due to upwelling. But upwelling like hurricanes and cold fronts that are invoked as causes of degradation are natural processes that reefs have survived for millions of years. What is different today is the ever increasing and universal impact of people as exemplified most recently by global climate change. A significant percentage of the more than 20 000 on site wastewater systems in the Keys were permitted in the 1980s or earlier when there was little concern for water quality. Adequate funding to deal with this issue has not been appropriated and the retrofit of these systems to alternative methods is proceeding inexcusably slowly. No one likes to hear bad news but it is a fact that the condition of most U.S. coral reefs is rapidly deteriorating and that nowhere remains pristine. We need to wake up fast to the true magnitude of the challenges we are facing to save our reefs by quickly following the Australian example of vastly increased protection and by implementing more comprehensive management. At the imminent risk of losing our reefs forever how can we do otherwise? 1912:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, What is the role and status of marine biodiversity in sustaining ocean ecosystem services such as food supply water quality control and ecosystem stability? In our recent study we addressed this question using meta analysis of published experimental data historical time series global catch trends and studies of marine reserves and fisheries closures. We found that in all of these independent data sets biodiversity was positively related to productivity stability and the supply of ecosystem services. The comments by Wilberg and Miller Jaenike and H lker . focus almost exclusively on our usage of catch trends and our projection of a possible fisheries collapse after accelerated biodiversity loss. First Wilberg and Miller argue that under certain assumptions a random process may generate declining trajectories in the global catch data that are similar to observed trends. They hypothesize that the increasing proportion of time series that fall below 10 PeRcEnT of the maximum catch (our operational definition of collapse) could be a simple accumulating function of time. If this were the case recovery after a collapse would certainly occur. Yet in reality recoveries of collapsed stocks are often rare as discussed below. Furthermore their supporting formula assumes an independent identically distributed (iid) times series. However the assumption of independence among data points does not hold for the aut ocorrelated random series that they use in their simulations nor for the catch data that we used in. Despite these shortcomings we were able to test Wilberg and Millers hypothesis that increasing length of time series is correlated with increasing likelihood of collapse across large marine ecosystems (LMEs). We used all available fisheries catch data from the catch database of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other sources as outlined in. Results show that for the 64 LMEs included in our original study there is no relation between the average start year of a fishery and the likelihood of a collapse. This means that ecosystems that have been fished for longer do not necessarily show more frequent collapses. Furthermore there is an inverse correlation between the average lifetime of a fishery (the length of time over which it produced catches) and the proportion of fisheries that are collapsed. This refutes the idea that longer catch series are more prone to collapse than shorter ones as suggested in. Wilberg and Miller further note that the causes for a 90 PeRcEnT decline in catch could be complex and do not necessarily indicate overexploitation. We agree and emphasize that the purpose of our study was not to test hypotheses about the putative causes of declining fisheries but to elucidate the role of marine biodiversity for stabilizing fisheries catches and other ecosystem goods and services. Although there may be disputes about driving causes in individual cases for global fisheries as a whole there is no reasonable doubt that most major declines in stock biomass and in corresponding yields are due to unsustainable levels of fishing pressure. Global assessments of stock biomass support our conclusions that a large fraction of the worlds fished biodiversity is overexploited or depleted (24 PeRcEnT of assessed stocks in 2003) that this fraction is increasing (from 10 PeRcEnT in 1974) and that recovery of depleted stocks under intense management is still an exception (1 PeRcEnT in 2003). An in depth analysis of fish stock collapse and recovery using available abundance data (not catches) also concluded that there is little evidence for rapid recovery from prolonged declines. This undermines Wilberg and Millers argument of a random process because population recovery should be just as likely as collapse under their assumption. In a second comment Jaenike focuses on the statistical model used to approximate time series trends from global catch data. He points out the clustering of points above and below the regression line that we have fitted to the time series. We note that this is a normal feature of any auto correlated time series. Jaenike then applies an ad hoc piecewise regression model to the latter part of the catch series (1967 to 2003) and shows that a different projection ensues if that model is used to extrapolate into the future. Breaking the time series at 1967 would only be justified if a different process were driving the latter part of the time series. This assumption is not backed by any mechanism such as a change in management at that time. We agree with his general point though that not too much reliance should be given to any one model and that alternative models are possible (for example a logistic regression would be an obvious choice). Likewise future projections from such alternative models would yield different results but would involve equally strong assumptions about the dynamics of global fisheries. This however was not the point of our study. Rather we sought to highlight that there is a progressive and consistent loss of the biodiversity that fuels our fisheries. This trend is negative and increasing no matter which model is applied to approximate it. It is seen in all the available data including the FAO report on the status of world fisheries which is based on stock assessments rather than catch trends. We therefore stand by our conclusion that the erosion of marine biodiversity is threatening world seafood supplies and emphasize that the protection and restoration of biodiversity must be a cornerstone of any rational management regime. In a third comment H lker . state that with respect to future projection of catch trends it is generally problematic to extrapolate outside the range of available data. Although we agree in principle a strict adherence to this rule would preclude any use of trend analysis to explore future scenarios. Our study drew attention to the fact that fisheries depend on a limited number of available taxa and that there was a monotonic trend of declining catches affecting an increasing number of taxa since 1950. We believe that it is appropriate to ask how long this trend could continue before reaching a global limit. This does not amount to a prediction of what is going to happen nor to an analysis of underlying mechanisms but it does raise legitimate concerns about the direction of the trend. This reasoning is well accepted in population viability analysis for example where projections can span several hundred years. We acknowledge that such projections are generally uncertain and may be used best as scenarios hypotheses or benchmarks against which to measure future progress in fisheries management and biodiversity conservation. Such progress will rely on the broad implementation of effective conservation measures. Marine reserves and fisheries closures have received much recent attention because they can generate rapid conservation and fisheries benefits. We showed that such benefits typically include an increase in species diversity and a restoration of services associated with the productivity and stability of the ecosystem. H lker . question the generality of that analysis. They suggest that our database was biased toward tropical areas; we note however that temperate reserves constituted 40 PeRcEnT of the available data. They further ask whether reserves or closures would enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services equally in tropical and temperate areas and whether they could benefit groundfish or pelagic fisheries. We used meta analysis of our published database to compare responses to protection between temperate and tropical areas. Responses were similar in direction but diversity and catch per unit effort increased more in temperate areas whereas temporal variability was reduced more in tropical areas. We also note that several prominent examples of groundfish recovery were associated with temperate closures. These results suggest that marine reserves and fisheries closures in temperate areas result in increased fish abundance and the recovery of biodiversity similar to what has been observed in the tropics. Unfortunately we cannot presently assess the specific effects of closures on pelagic fisheries because of a lack of published data. Simulations indicate that large scale movements of target species and their fisheries may complicate both the siting and the assessment of marine reserves aimed at restoring pelagic biodiversity. We emphasize that closures and reserves are not a panacea and need to be augmented by other measures to reduce total fishing mortality and rebuild depleted marine populations. This is particularly true for highly mobile pelagic species. Designing cost effective instruments to limit catch fishing effort and the use of unselective fishing gear are crucial steps to ensure the sustainability of fisheries that depend on these species. We conclude that our discussion of a possible seafood collapse has focused much attention on patterns and trends in global fisheries. Although future projections of such trends can be informative benchmarks they do not represent necessary outcomes. We have attempted to refocus attention on what is known now. The ongoing erosion of marine biodiversity is exceedingly well documented as are some of the functional and societal consequences. There is also a clear understanding of what past mistakes we need to avoid and what we can learn from recent successes. Whether ocean ecosystems continue on a trajectory of decline whether they stabilize or whether they recover on a large scale will thus depend on our collective societal choices. 1914:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although seafood is the most highly traded food internationally it is an often overlooked component of global food security. It provides essential local food livelihoods and export earnings. Although global capture fisheries production is unlikely to increase aquaculture is growing considerably. Sustaining seafoods contributions to food security hinges on the ability of institutions particularly in developing countries to protect and improve ecosystem health in the face of increasing pressures from international trade. Seafood (fish and shellfish harvested from capture fisheries and aquaculture production in marine and freshwater environments) contributes at least 15 PeRcEnT of average animal protein consumption to 2.9 billion people and as much as 50 PeRcEnT for some small island and West African states. Seafood is the main source of omega 3 fatty acids that are essential for brain development and provides important micronutrients for the poor. As a source of livelihood capture fisheries and aquaculture employed 43.5 million people in 2006 and 520 million people relied on income from seafood production). Seafood is also the most highly traded food commodity internationally. Fish and shellfish exports from developing countries exceed the value of coffee rubber cocoa tea tobacco meat and rice combined. Developing countries benefit from this trade by exporting high valued seafood to developed countries importing low valued seafood and using the surplus value to purchase other goods and services. However they often lack the institutions necessary to prevent deleterious ecosystem impacts of seafood production and to sustain trade benefits. Developed countries have a history of these problems as well but with less obvious consequences. Although terrestrial food systems provide protein support livelihoods and generate export earnings two characteristics of fisheries and aquaculture production uniquely threaten food security: tight coupling to ecosystems and dependence on common pool resources. Fisheries and aquaculture are vulnerable to exogenous shocks to ecosystems such as climate change but endogenous changes are particularly important. Commonpool fish stocks are often open access and fishing effort can push stock levels beyond maximum sustainable yield. In those cases price increases lead to reduced seafood production. This scenario does not generally occur in terrestrial food production. 1917:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A common assumption is that ecosystem services respond linearly to changes in habitat size. This assumption leads frequently to an   all or none   choice of either preserving coastal habitats or converting them to human use. However our survey of wave attenuation data from field studies of mangroves salt marshes seagrass beds nearshore coral reefs and sand dunes reveals that these relationships are rarely linear. By incorporating nonlinear wave attenuation in estimating coastal protection values of mangroves in Thailand we show that the optimal land use option may instead be the integration of development and conservation consistent with ecosystem based management goals. This result suggests that reconciling competing demands on coastal habitats should not always result in stark preservation versus conversion choices. 1921:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, After a long history of overexploitation increasing efforts to restore marine ecosystems and rebuild fisheries are under way. Here we analyze current trends from a fisheries and conservation perspective. In 5 of 10 well studied ecosystems the average exploitation rate has recently declined and is now at or below the rate predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield for seven systems. Yet 63 PeRcEnT of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions including catch restrictions gear modification and closed areas depending on local context. Impacts of international fleets and the lack of alternatives to fishing complicate prospects for rebuilding fisheries in many poorer regions highlighting the need for a global perspective on rebuilding marine resources. 1931:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Degradation of coral reef ecosystems began centuries ago but there is no global summary of the magnitude of change. We compiled records extending back thousands of years of the status and trends of seven major guilds of carnivores herbivores and architectural species from 14 regions. Large animals declined before small animals and architectural species and Atlantic reefs declined before reefs in the Red Sea and Australia but the trajectories of decline were markedly similar worldwide. All reefs were substantially degraded long before outbreaks of coral disease and bleaching. Regardless of these new threats reefs will not survive without immediate protection from human exploitation over large spatial scales. 1933:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological extinction caused by overfishing precedes all other pervasive human disturbance to coastal ecosystems including pollution degradation of water quality and anthropogenic climate change. Historical abundances of large consumer species were fantastically large in comparison with recent observations. Paleoecological archaeological and historical data show that time lags of decades to centuries occurred between the onset of overfishing and consequent changes in ecological communities because unfished species of similar trophic level assumed the ecological roles of overfished species until they too were overfished or died of epidemic diseases related to overcrowding. Retrospective data not only help to clarify underlying causes and rates of ecological change but they also demonstrate achievable goals for restoration and management of coastal ecosystems that could not even be contemplated based on the limited perspective of recent observations alone. 1937:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Estuarine and coastal transformation is as old as civilization yet has dramatically accelerated over the past 150 to 300 years. Reconstructed time lines causes and consequences of change in 12 once diverse and productive estuaries and coastal seas worldwide show similar patterns: Human impacts have depleted  90 PeRcEnT of formerly important species destroyed  65 PeRcEnT of seagrass and wetland habitat degraded water quality and accelerated species invasions. Twentieth century conservation efforts achieved partial recovery of upper trophic levels but have so far failed to restore former ecosystem structure and function. Our results provide detailed historical baselines and quantitative targets for ecosystem based management and marine conservation. 1944:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human dominated marine ecosystems are experiencing accelerating loss of populations and species with largely unknown consequences. We analyzed local experiments long term regional time series and global fisheries data to test how biodiversity loss affects marine ecosystem services across temporal and spatial scales. Overall rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential stability and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity in contrast increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21 PeRcEnT on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the oceans capacity to provide food maintain water quality and recover from perturbations. Yet available data suggest that at this point these trends are still reversible. 1950:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Knowledge of mammalian diversity is still surprisingly disparate both regionally and taxonomically. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of the conservation status and distribution of the worlds mammals. Data compiled by 1700 experts cover all 5487 species including marine mammals. Global macroecological patterns are very different for land and marine species but suggest common mechanisms driving diversity and endemism across systems. Compared with land species threat levels are higher among marine mammals driven by different processes (accidental mortality and pollution rather than habitat loss) and are spatially distinct (peaking in northern oceans rather than in Southeast Asia). Marine mammals are also disproportionately poorly known. These data are made freely available to support further scientific developments and conservation action. 1953:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine reserves have been proposed as a remedy for overfishing and declining marine biodiversity but concern that reserves would inherently reduce yields has impeded their implementation. It was found that management of fisheries through reserves and management through effort control produce identical yields under a reasonable set of simplifying assumptions corresponding to a broad range of biological conditions. Indeed for populations with sedentary adults (invertebrates and reef fishes) reserves have important advantages for sustainability making marine reserves the preferred management approach. 1960:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent reports suggest that many well assessed fisheries in developed countries are moving toward sustainability. We examined whether the same conclusion holds for fisheries lacking formal assessment which comprise  80 PeRcEnT of global catch. We developed a method using species life history catch and fishery development data to estimate the status of thousands of unassessed fisheries worldwide. We found that small unassessed fisheries are in substantially worse condition than assessed fisheries but that large unassessed fisheries may be performing nearly as well as their assessed counterparts. Both small and large stocks however continue to decline; 64 PeRcEnT of unassessed stocks could provide increased sustainable harvest if rebuilt. Our results suggest that global fishery recovery would simultaneously create increases in abundance (56 PeRcEnT) and fishery yields (8 to 40 PeRcEnT). 1961:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recovery of overexploited marine populations has been slow and most remain below target biomass levels. A key question is whether this is due to insufficient reductions in harvest rates or the erosion of population resilience. Using a global meta analysis of overfished stocks we find that resilience of those stocks subjected to moderate levels of overfishing is enhanced not compromised offering the possibility of swift recovery. However prolonged intense overexploitation especially for collapsed stocks not only delays rebuilding but also substantially increases the uncertainty in recovery times despite predictable influences of fishing and life history. Timely and decisive reductions in harvest rates could mitigate this uncertainty. Instead current harvest and low biomass levels render recovery improbable for the majority of the worlds depleted stocks. 1969:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The management and conservation of the worlds oceans require synthesis of spatial data on the distribution and intensity of human activities and the overlap of their impacts on marine ecosystems. We developed an ecosystem specific multiscale spatial model to synthesize 17 global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change for 20 marine ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction ( 41 PeRcEnT) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However large areas of relatively little human impact remain particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem based management; and to inform marine spatial planning education and basic research. 1974:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We evaluated the commercial and recreational fishery landings over the past 22 years first at the national level then for populations of concern (those that are overfished or experiencing overfishing) and finally by region. Recreational landings in 2002 account for 4 PeRcEnT of total marine fish landed in the United States. With large industrial fisheries excluded  menhaden and Pollock) the recreational component rises to 10 PeRcEnT. Among populations of concern recreational landings in 2002 account for 23 PeRcEnT of the total nationwide rising to 38 PeRcEnT in the South Atlantic and 64 PeRcEnT in the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover it affects many of the most valued overfished species including red drum bocaccio and red snapper alI of which are taken primarily in the recreational fishery. 1977:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Anthropogenic disturbances are ubiquitous in the ocean but their impacts on marine species are hotly debated. We evaluated marine fish statuses using conservation (Red List threatened or not) and fisheries (above or below reference points) metrics compared their alignment and diagnosed why discrepancies arise. Whereas only 13.5 PeRcEnT of Red Listed marine fishes (n 2952) are threatened 40 PeRcEnT and 21 PeRcEnT of populations with stock assessments (n 166) currently are below their more conservative and riskier reference points respectively. Conservation and fisheries metrics aligned well (70.5 PeRcEnT to 80.7 PeRcEnT) despite their mathematical disconnect. Red Listings were not biased towards exaggerating threat status and egregious errors where populations were categorized at opposite extremes of fisheries and conservation metrics were rare. Our analyses suggest conservation and fisheries scientists will agree on the statuses of exploited marine fishes in most cases leaving only the question of appropriate management responses for populations of mutual concern still unresolved. 2009:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There are many examples of ecological theory informing fishery management. Yet fisheries also provide tremendous opportunities to test ecological theory through large scale repeated and well documented perturbations of natural systems. Although treating fisheries as experiments presents several challenges few comparable tests exist at the ecosystem scale. Experimental manipulations of fish populations in lakes have been widely used to develop and test ecological theory. Controlled manipulation of fish populations in open marine systems is rarely possible but fisheries data provide a valuable substitute for such manipulations. To highlight the value of marine fisheries data we review leading ecological theories that have been empirically tested using such data. For example density dependence has been examined through meta analysis of spawning stock and recruitment data to show that compensation (higher population growth) occurs commonly when populations are reduced to low levels while depensation (the Allee effect) is rare. As populations decline spatial changes typically involve populations contracting into high density core habitats while abandoning less productive habitats. Fishing down predators may result in trophic cascades possibly shifting entire ecosystems into alternate stable states although alternate states can be maintained by both ecological processes and continued fishing pressure. Conversely depleting low trophic level groups may affect central place foragers although these bottom up effects rarely appear to impact fish perhaps because many fish populations have been reduced to the point that they are no longer prey limited. Fisheries provide empirical tests for diversity stability relations: catch data suggest that more diverse systems recover faster and provide more stable returns than less diverse systems. Fisheries have also provided examples of the tragedy of the commons as well as counter examples where common property resources have been managed successfully. We also address two barriers to use of fisheries data to answer ecological questions: differences in terminology for similar concepts and misuse of records of fishery landings (catch data) as a proxy for biomass trends. 2017:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A symposium held at the annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society in Rapid City South Dakota in 1992 provided an overview of bioenergetics modeling and led to the publication of a series of papers in the Transactions of the American Fisheries Society the next year. Since then Wisconsin Sea Grant has published a new version of its bioenergetics software (Fish Bioenergetics 3.0) and a manual to facilitate use of that model. Review of the more recent literature reveals continuing development and application of this modeling approach. A symposium held at the annual meeting in Madison Wisconsin in 2004 provided an opportunity for reporting progress and concerns about the   Wisconsin model. This special section stems from the papers presented at that meeting. 2028:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A collection of five recent papers assesses the role and effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Mediterranean. The papers provide a broad perspective of MPAs and include social economic cultural biological and statistical components. 2045:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Hunting by humans played a major role in extirpating terrestrial megafauna on several continents and megafaunal loss continues today in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Recent declines of large marine vertebrates that are of little or no commercial value such as sea turtles seabirds and marine mammals have focused attention on the ecological impacts of incidental take or bycatch in global fisheries. In spite of the recognition of the problem of bycatch few comprehensive assessments of its effects have been conducted. Many vulnerable species live in pelagic habitats making surveys logistically complex and expensive. Bycatch data are sparse and our understanding of the demography of the affected populations is often rudimentary. These factors combined with the large spatial scales that pelagic vertebrates and fishing fleets cover make accurate and timely bycatch assessments difficult. Here we review the current research that addresses these challenging questions in the face of uncertainty analytical limitations and mounting conservation crises. 2047:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large scale exploitation of wild animals and plants through fishing hunting and logging often depends on augmentation through releases of translocated or captively raised individuals. Such releases are performed worldwide in vast numbers. Augmentation can be demographically and economically beneficial but can also cause four types of adverse genetic change to wild populations: (1) loss of genetic variation (2) loss of adaptations (3) change of population composition and (4) change of population structure. While adverse genetic impacts are recognized and documented in fisheries little effort is devoted to actually monitoring them. In forestry and wildlife management genetic risks associated with releases are largely neglected. We outline key features of programs to effectively monitor consequences of such releases on natural populations. 2049:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most of epidemiological theory has been developed for terrestrial systems but the significance of disease in the ocean is now being recognized. However the extent to which terrestrial epidemiology can be directly transferred to marine systems is uncertain. Many broad types of disease causing organism occur both on land and in the sea and it is clear that some emergent disease problems in marine environments are caused by pathogens moving from terrestrial to marine systems. However marine systems are qualitatively different from terrestrial environments and these differences affect the application of modelling and management approaches that have been developed for terrestrial systems. Phyla and body plans are more diverse in marine environments and marine organisms have different life histories and probably different disease transmission modes than many of their terrestrial counterparts. Marine populations are typically more open than terrestrial ones with the potential for long distance dispersal of larvae. Potentially this might enable unusually rapid propagation of epidemics in marine systems and there are several examples of this. Taken together these differences will require the development of new approaches to modelling and control of infectious disease in the ocean. 2061:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recently the global state of marine fisheries and its effects on ecosystems have received much scientific (and public) scrutiny. There is little doubt that global limits to exploitation have been reached and that recovery of depleted stocks must become a cornerstone of fisheries management. Yet current trends appear to be diverging between well assessed regions showing stabilization of fish biomass and other regions continuing to decline. This divergence can be explained by improved controls on exploitation rates in several wealthy countries but low management capacity elsewhere. Here we identify an urgent need to direct priorities towards fisheries conservation hotspots of increasing exploitation rates high biodiversity and poor management capacity and conclude that the future of fish depends at least in part on redoubling science co management and conservation efforts in those regions. 206:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coral reefs are threatened by human activities both on the land and in the sea. However standard approaches for prioritizing locations for marine and terrestrial reserves neglect to consider connections between ecosystems. We demonstrate an integrated approach for coral reef conservation with the objective of prioritizing marine reserves close to catchments with high forest cover in order to facilitate ecological processes that rely upon intact land sea protected area connections and minimize negative impact of land based runoff on coral reefs. Our aims are to (1) develop and apply simple models of connections between ecosystems that require little data and (2) incorporate different types of connectivity models into spatial conservation prioritization. We compared how if at all the locations and attributes  costs) of priorities differ from an approach that ignores connections. We analyzed spatial prioritization plans that allow for no connectivity adjacent connectivity in the sea symmetric and asymmetric land sea connectivity and the combination of adjacent connectivity in the sea and asymmetric land sea connectivity. The overall reserve system costs were similar for all scenarios. We discovered that integrated planning delivered substantially different spatial priorities compared to the approach that ignored connections. Only 11 40 PeRcEnT of sites that were high priority for conservation were similar between scenarios with and without connectivity. Many coral reefs that were a high priority when we considered adjacent connectivity in the sea and ignored land sea connectivity were assigned to low priorities when symmetric land sea connectivity was included and vice versa. Our approach can be applied to incorporate connections between ecosystems. . 2077:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The term nursery implies a special place for juvenile nekton (fishes and decapod crustaceans) where density survival and growth of juveniles and movement to adult habitat are enhanced over those in adjoining juvenile habitat types. We reviewed recent literature concerning these four topics and conducted meta analyses for density and survival data. Most studies of mangroves as nurseries have addressed only occurrence or density of fishes or decapods have not used quantitative sampling methods and have not compared alternate habitats. Comparison of nekton densities among alternate habitats suggests that at times lower densities may be typical of mangroves when compared to seagrass coral reef marsh and non vegetated habitats. There is little direct consumption of mangrove detritus by nekton. C N and S isotope studies reveal little retention of mangrove production by higher consumers. Densities of prey for transient fishes and decapods may be greater within mangroves than elsewhere but there has been no verification that food availability affects growth or survival. Experimental evidence indicates that mangrove roots and debris provide refuge for small nekton from predators thus enhancing overall survival. There is no evidence that more individuals move to adult habitats from mangroves than from alternate inshore habitats. There is an obvious need to devise appropriate experiments to test the nursery functions of mangroves. Such data may then be one more reason to add support for mangrove conservation and preservation. 210:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Given the widely recognized need to better protect the oceans but limited resources to do so methods for prioritizing potential protected area sites are important. This is particularly true for the open oceans where few protected areas currently exist and data availability is limited. Here we examine the relationship between the distributions of tuna and billfish species richness (an indicator of pelagic biodiversity) the human impact drivers of fishing pressure (quantified as cumulative removals) and sea surface temperature increase (quantified as the increase in large positive anomalies) in tropical to temperate oceans at the scale of a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid. We investigate relationships using Generalised Additive Models and Regression Tree analysis and identify the top 50   hotspot   cells for species richness and each of the two impact drivers. We find that both impact drivers significantly overlap with high species richness but relationships are complex non linear and ocean basin specific. Higher fishing pressure is associated with higher species richness in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and this overlap is particularly prominent in the central Pacific and in the Indian Ocean around Sri Lanka. In the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans species richness is generally higher in areas that have seen lower levels of change in sea surface temperature and only one cell near Easter Island is a hotspot for species richness and sea surface temperature increase. While species richness and impact drivers overlap in some areas there are many areas with high species richness and limited apparent impact. This suggests that area based conservation strategies that aim to protect areas of high pelagic biodiversity may be achievable with limited displacement of fishing effort. . 215:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of specific mortality sources is crucial for management of species that are vulnerable to human interactions. Beachcast carcasses represent an unknown fraction of at sea mortalities. While a variety of physical  water temperature) and biological  decomposition) factors as well as the distribution of animals and their mortality sources likely affect the probability of carcass stranding physical oceanography plays a major role in where and when carcasses strand. Here we evaluate the influence of nearshore physical oceanographic and wind regimes on sea turtle strandings to decipher seasonal trends and make qualitative predictions about stranding patterns along oceanfront beaches. We use results from oceanic drift bottle experiments to check our predictions and provide an upper limit on stranding proportions. We compare predicted current regimes from a 3D physical oceanographic model to spatial and temporal locations of both sea turtle carcass strandings and drift bottle landfalls. Drift bottle return rates suggest an upper limit for the proportion of sea turtle carcasses that strand (about 20 PeRcEnT). In the South Atlantic Bight seasonal development of along shelf flow coincides with increased numbers of strandings of both turtles and drift bottles in late spring and early summer. The model also predicts net offshore flow of surface waters during winter the season with the fewest relative strandings. The drift bottle data provide a reasonable upper bound on how likely carcasses are to reach land from points offshore and bound the general timeframe for stranding post mortem (  two weeks). Our findings suggest that marine turtle strandings follow a seasonal regime predictable from physical oceanography and mimicked by drift bottle experiments. Managers can use these findings to reevaluate incidental strandings limits and fishery takes for both nearshore and offshore mortality sources. 221:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The vast Brazilian coast harbors unique and diverse reef fish communities. Unfortunately relatively little is known about the impact of fishing on these fish species and few management or conservation efforts are being made to protect them. Here we examine the effect of different levels of protection on the composition abundance and size structure of reef fish species along a 2500 km portion of the Brazilian coastline noting in particular the relative abundance of endemics and the effect of protection on these species. Pairwise comparisons of sites with different protection status (more versus less protected) were used to determine the potential responses of reef fishes to the establishment of marine protected areas. Highly targeted species (top predators and large herbivores) were significantly more abundant and larger in size within sites with a higher degree of protection indicating that they benefit from protection while lightly fished and unfished species were not. These results are consistent with past work documenting the responses of species to protection. Here we use our results in particular to suggest strategies and provide expectations for managing and protecting Brazilian reef fisheries. Because this biogeographic province lies entirely within the jurisdiction of a single nation there may be unique and significant opportunities to effectively manage and conserve these fish species. 223:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Two key questions regarding   no take   marine reserves are: (1) how effective are reserves likely to be and (2) how does effectiveness vary with life history attributes and the relative size of reserves. To investigate these questions we use a simple Ricker model that includes fishing larval dispersal and larval loss while in a planktonic pool and that tracks protected and unprotected populations. We applied two different measures of reserve effectiveness to our simulation results. One metric was intended to reflect goals oriented towards conservation and the second was intended to reflect fishery enhancement goals Both metrics compare the situation before reserves are established to after the reserve has been in place and a new equilibrium was reached. Yield effectiveness is defined as the total equilibrium annual harvest after reserves are established divided by the total annual harvest before reserves are established. Conservation effectiveness is defined as the average adult density inside the reserve divided by the average density in the same area prior to reserve establishment. A substantial fraction of the 5120 simulated parameter combinations representing different harvest rates and life history attributes went extinct in the absence of a reserve and these scenarios leading to extinction could be predicted accurately (85 PeRcEnT aptly classified) simply on the basis of exploitation rate and population growth rate. Of the cases that did not go extinct we compared the performance of reserves as measured by each effectiveness metric. Few of the cases (less than 8 PeRcEnT) produced effective reserves as measured in terms of increased harvest; whereas over half of the cases resulted in effective reserves as measured by conservation effectiveness. Moreover the two measures of reserve effectiveness were only weakly correlated. Simple linear regression or polynomial regression could explain at most 23 PeRcEnT of the variation in reserve effectiveness as measured by either metric. As expected the size of the reserve area had a marked and typically negative effect on total annual yield which suggests that while marine protected areas may do a good job of conserving protected populations there will generally be pressure from the fishing community to keep them small because of their tendency to reduce total catch. 229:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The removal of invasive mammals from islands is one of societys most powerful tools for preventing extinctions and restoring ecosystems. Given the demonstrable high conservation impact and return on investment of eradications new networks are needed to fully leverage invasive mammal eradications programs for biodiversity conservation at large. There have been over 800 invasive mammal eradications from islands and emerging innovations in technology and techniques suggest that island area will soon no longer be the limiting factor for removing invasive mammals from islands. Rather securing the necessary social and economic capital will be one main challenge as practitioners target larger and more biologically complex islands. With a new alliance between conservation practitioners and the fisheries sector biodiversity offsets may be a promising source of capital. A suite of incentives exists for fisheries NGOs and governments to embrace a framework that includes fishery bycatch offsets for seabirds and sea turtles. A bycatch management framework based on the hierarchy of   avoid minimize and offset   from the Convention on Biological Diversity would result in cost effective conservation gains for many threatened seabirds and sea turtles affected by fisheries. Those involved with island conservation and fisheries management are presented with unprecedented opportunities and challenges to operationalize a scheme that will allow for the verifiable offset of fisheries impacts to seabirds and sea turtles which would likely result in unparalleled marine conservation gains and novel cross sector alliances. 237:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Increasingly severe storms and weaker carbonate materials associated with more acidic oceans will increase the vulnerability of reef corals to mechanical damage. Mechanistic predictions based on measurements of colony mechanical vulnerability and future climate scenarios demonstrate dramatic shifts in assemblage structure following hydrodynamic disturbances including switches in species dominance on the reef and thus potential for post disturbance recovery. Larger colonies are more resistant to factors such as disease and competition for space and complex morphologies support more associated reef species. Future reefs are thus expected to have lower colony abundances and be dominated by small and morphologically simple yet mechanically robust species which will in turn support lower levels of whole reef biodiversity than do present day reefs. 261:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nearshore estuarine and marine ecosystems__e.g. seagrass meadows marshes and mangrove forests__ serve many important functions in coastal waters.Most notably they have extremely high primary and secondary productivity and support a great abundance and diversity of fish and invertebrates. Because of their effects on the diversity and productivity of macrofauna these estuarine and marine ecosystems are often referred to as nurseries in numerous papers textbooks and government sponsored reports. Indeed the role of these nearshore ecosystems as nurseries is an established ecological concept accepted by scientists conservation groups managers and the public and cited as justification for the protection and conservation of these areas. Nonetheless the nursery role concept has rarely been stated clearly even in papers that purport to test it. This ambiguity hinders the effectiveness of the nursery role concept as a tool for conservation and management.We seek to redress that ambiguity by briefly tracing the history of the concept developing a clear hypothesis with testable predictions and discussing how this work can focus efforts in research conservation restoration and management. 268:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, During the past several decades high numbers of gelatinous zooplankton species have been reported in many estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Coupled with media driven public perception a paradigm has evolved in which the global ocean ecosystems are thought to be heading toward being dominated by   nuisance   jellyfish. We question this current paradigm by presenting a broad overview of gelatinous zooplankton in a historical context to develop the hypothesis that population changes reflect the human mediated alteration of global ocean ecosystems. To this end we synthesize information related to the evolutionary context of contemporary gelatinous zooplankton blooms the human frame of reference for changes in gelatinous zooplankton populations and whether sufficient data are available to have established the paradigm. We conclude that the current paradigm in which it is believed that there has been a global increase in gelatinous zooplankton is unsubstantiated and we develop a strategy for addressing the critical questions about long term human related changes in the sea as they relate to gelatinous zooplankton blooms. 275:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pesticides applied on land are commonly transported by runoff or spray drift to aquatic ecosystems where they are potentially toxic to fishes and other nontarget organisms. Pesticides add to and interact with other stressors of ecosystem processes including surface water diversions losses of spawning and rearing habitats nonnative species and harmful algal blooms. Assessing the cumulative effects of pesticides on species or ecological functions has been difficult for historical legal conceptual and practical reasons. To explore these challenges we examine current use (modern) pesticides and their potential connections to the abundances of fishes in the San Francisco Estuary (California). Declines in delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and other species have triggered mandatory and expensive management actions in the urbanizing estuary and agriculturally productive Central Valley. Our inferences are transferable to other situations in which toxics may drive changes in ecological status and trends. 279:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seagrasses marine flowering plants have a long evolutionary history but are now challenged with rapid environmental changes as a result of coastal human population pressures. Seagrasses provide key ecological services including organic carbon production and export nutrient cycling sediment stabilization enhanced biodiversity and trophic transfers to adjacent habitats in tropical and temperate regions. They also serve as   coastal canaries    global biological sentinels of increasing anthropogenic influences in coastal ecosystems with large scale losses reported worldwide. Multiple stressors including sediment and nutrient runoff physical disturbance invasive species disease commercial fishing practices aquaculture overgrazing algal blooms and global warming cause seagrass declines at scales of square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Reported seagrass losses have led to increased awareness of the need for seagrass protection monitoring management and restoration. However seagrass science which has rapidly grown is disconnected from public awareness of seagrasses which has lagged behind awareness of other coastal ecosystems. There is a critical need for a targeted global conservation effort that includes a reduction of watershed nutrient and sediment inputs to seagrass habitats and a targeted educational program informing regulators and the public of the value of seagrass meadows. 292:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,298:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A major unanswered question in marine ecology is the degree of connectedness between local populations. Put another way what proportion of youne arriving into a local population are products of local production? What is the source of recruits for any local population and where do the young produced in a local population go? The answers to these questions are unknown for most widespread species with a pelagic larval phase. Proper marine management depends on knowledge in this area: the efficacy of any reserve design for example is highly dependent on the degree to which it is reliant on other populations for recruitment and the degree to which it supplies other areas. 300:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Advantages of dispersal on the scales that are possible in a long pelagic larval period are not apparent even for benthic species. An alternative hypothesis is that wide dispersal may be an incidental byproduct of an ontogenetic migration from and then back to the parental habitat. Under this hypothesis the water column is a better habitat than the bottom for early development. Because the parental area is often an especially favorable habitat for juveniles and adults selection may even favor larval retention or larval return rather than dispersal. Where larval capabilities and currents permit a high percentage of recruits may then be produced from local adults. Expected consequences of a high proportion of local recruitment are stronger links between stock and recruitment greater vulnerability to recruitment overfishing and local modifications of habitat greater local benefits from fishery reserves and possibly more localized adaptation within populations. Export of some larvae is consistent with a high proportion of retained or returning larvae could stabilize populations linked by larval exchange and provide connectivity between marine reserves. Even a small amount of larval export could account for the greater gene flow large ranges and long evolutionary durations seen in species with long pelagic larval stages. 304:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In a 2009 paper by Worm . fisheries biologists and conservation biologists found common ground in recommending spatial planning to benefit marine fisheries and biodiversity. Frontiers on land and in the ocean have few users relative to resources; as this ratio increases governance suitable to the frontier no longer works because peoples interests collide and biodiversity is lost. Increasing ocean uses and troubled fisheries are reasons to shift to ecosystem based marine spatial planning and management which reflect patterns and processes of both fish and people. Protecting places can eliminate fragmentation spatial and temporal mismatches caused by   siloed   sectoral management where agencies that regulate different sectors in the same places largely ignore the needs of other sectors. Modern fishery management does not reflect the heterogeneity of fish populations and human uses. By reducing fishing mortality to zero one spatial tool marine reserves restores large female fishes which produce more eggs and aids recovery of species in which females become males at larger sizes. Reserves can also maintain fishes genetic structure. Australia created the   gold standard   for marine spatial planning in Great Barrier Reef Marine Park a mosaic of ecosystems with differing availability to fishing. Other nations are adopting this approach. Even the best spatial plans will have problems that cross ecosystem boundaries but advantages accrue to fishermen who stay within designated areas and let fish come to them. Areas can be deliberately configured to improve both biodiversity conservation and fishery yields and to save on fishermens fuel costs. 305:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In many parts of the world marine ornamentals fishes and invertebrates collected and sold in the aquarium trade comprise an increasingly important fishery. Few management strategies have been devised for these fisheries yet they may represent the most tractable systems: the benthic life stages are relatively site attached and easily sampled and many species are amenable to experimental study. Here a stochastic population model is developed with which to investigate the efficacy of exploitation strategies designed to manage a marine ornamental fishery. Extensive field studies of the tropical damselfish Dascyllus trimaculatus were used to define functions and estimate associated parameters that govern the dynamics of the unexploited population. Sources of uncertainty in the predictions of the model were then evaluated and the responses to different exploitation control rules simulated. Effects resulting from uncertainty due to variable larval settlement were comparable in magnitude to effects of uncertainty in parameter estimates. In addition despite resident facilitated settlement yields were not a unimodal function of catch rate. Instead yield typically increased with catch rate. The absence of a dome shaped yield curve appeared to result from an interaction between facilitated settlement and subsequent density dependence. 306:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Models of larval dispersal rarely incorporate the behavior of larvae yet many potential settlers of marine invertebrates and fishes may navigate toward suitable settlement sites by responding to gradients of environmental stimuli. Accordingly a variety of stimuli may be used for navigation (directed movements to the source of stimuli) and partial navigation  migration to a current that may favor transport to a settlement site) in the pelagic environment. A broad diversity of taxa have senses that allow them to detect variation in: water chemistry (biotic sources amino acids and abiotic sources salinity) sound and vibration (biotic sources grunting fishes abiotic sources waves breaking) white light gradients and images polarized light current direction magnetism and water pressure. Some organisms can detect multiple stimuli  decapods and fishes) and integrated sensory responses are likely to be common; many potential settlers of these taxa are good swimmers. Demonstrations of strong orientation to stimuli and navigation over short (centimeters to meters) and broad spatial scales (tens of meters to tens of kilometers) are most common for these groups. Partial navigation. involving vertical migration is common for invertebrate larvae. A consequence of vertical migration can be transportation that favors movement to suitable settlement habitat. Navigation over a range of spatial scales may use stimuli that are very predictable regardless of location  water pressure gravity). The gradients of other stimuli may be more useful for environment specific signals and even the location of natal habitats locations and conspecifics  using sound or smell of specific taxa). We argue that some larvae may use a hierarchy of sensory cues to find suitable settlement sites and that some of the same types of stimuli may be used at more than one spatial scale (as demonstrated for adult salmonid fishes). There are good demonstrations of the use of cues for orientation and navigation at small spatial scales (less than a few meters). More information however is required at spatial scales that are relevant to navigation over kilometers before behavior can be incorporated more accurately into models of larval dispersal. 307:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mounting evidence suggests that some populations of benthic marine organisms may be less demographically open than previously thought The degree to which a population receives recruits from local sources versus other populations has important ecological and management ramifications. For either of these reasons it is often desirable to estimate the degree to which a population of interest is self recruiting. Although methods for actual estimation of population self recruitment are limited and often difficult to employ the presence of several biological and physical conditions may improve our estimates of self recruitment for particular populations Biological traits of benthic adults (relative fecundity spatial and temporal patterns of spawning and larval release parental investment) as well as pelagic larvae (stage of development at hatching pelagic larval duration vertical migration behavior horizontal swimming ability and sensory capabilities) influence where and when larvae are released where and how they are transported their ability to move actively in the pelagic realm and finally spatial and temporal settlement patterns. Physical variables potentially influencing self recruitment include site isolation coastal complexity and flow variability. Within these physical variables we discuss explicit mechanisms by which larvae may be retained in proximity to their natal population. We provide examples from specific locations such as coral reefs isolated islands and seamounts and semi enclosed embayments such as lagoons and estuaries as well as characteristic oceanographic features such as upwelling systems fronts moving convergences eddies and counter currents. We evaluate direct and indirect evidence to predict the relationship between these biophysical variables and the degree of self recruitment in benthic marine organisms. We conclude that physical factors that result in a departure from unidirectional depth uniform water flow provide the opportunity for retention of larvae and therefore of self recruitment. These physical factors are common in the ocean and vary in intensity among locations and times. Some enable retention of passive larvae (physical retention). whereas others lead to retention only with active behavioral input by the larvae (biophysical retention). Larval behavior that can contribute to or result in retention or return to natal sites ranges from simple vertical orientation (within the capabilities of the larvae of most taxa) to complex sensory abilities and strong swimming (known to occur in larvae of a few taxa particularly decapod crustaceans and fishes). For all taxa. both the pelagic larval duration and the time to behavioral competency will have a strong influence on likelihood of self recruitment. Understanding the biophysical mechanisms by which larvae are retained near or return to their natal population will be necessary before generalizations can be made. Examples highlight the importance of each variable to processes controlling self recruitment. For most cot relates further study is clearly warranted. Although certain variables hold promise for predicting self recruitment complex non linear interactions among these biophysical variables must be considered. 309:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent applications of ecosystem models have had some apparent success evaluating how fisheries and environmental changes have affected marine populations and a stage has been reached where ecosystem models can be used to describe agents of mortality and trophic interdependencies in the marine environment with some credibility. This success has raised the stakes for modeling and caused its focus to evolve to include ecosystem scale optimization policies aimed modestly. at determining the mix of fishing fleets that will optimize a combination of objectives subject to the assumptions inherent in the model as is the case with all models. A resemblance between our model predictions and real world conditions may indicate that trade offs among economic social and ecosystem objectives resulting from optimization for fleet configurations are more pronounced than hitherto recognized. The present paper reports the consequences of such optimizations for a model meant to mimic aspects of the Gulf of Thailand ecosystem intended to determine how the model reacts to different weightings for the objective functions individually and jointly to examine the trade offs involved. The results indicate that optimizing for economic profit is consistent with including ecosystem considerations whereas optimizing landed value is in conflict with profit as well as ecosystem optimization. 310:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recently the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service was petitioned to list North Atlantic white marlin as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA requires a stock assessment of status and trends for listed species and will severely restrict U.S. commercial and recreational fisheries but because by catch by foreign longline fleets account for more than 95 PeRcEnT of marlin mortality applying the ESA to U.S. fleets would have little direct effect. We analyzed an alternative management policy by using an Ecosim model of the central north Pacific to simulate a fishing strategy that reduces marlin by catch by removing longline hooks that fish in water less than 120 m in depth. Mortality rates might be reduced by about 50 PeRcEnT through removal of less than 15 PeRcEnT of hooks. After 30 yrs blue marlin biomass had increased to 2.8 times and striped marlin biomass to about 1.8 times that expected under no change in fishing practices. Ecological consequences included decreased abundance of adult yellowfin tuna. This result produced an economic trade off of lost fishery revenues (primarily yellowfin tuna) and gains due to increased catches of billfishes in recreational fisheries. 311:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The majority of shallow water marine species have a two phase life cycle in which relatively sedentary demersal adults produce pelagic larvae. Because these larval stages are potentially subject to dispersal by ocean cur rents it has been widely accepted that local populations are open. with recruitment resulting from the arrival of larvae from non local sources. However a growing number of studies indicate that larvae are capable of recruiting back to their source population. Here we review the evidence for self recruitment in demersal marine populations drawing from studies of endemism introduced species population genetics stock recruitment relationships larval distributions populations at the limit of a species range and applications of environmental and chemical markers. These studies indicate that self recruitment can and does occur across species representative of most life history traits and geographical localities. Thus the ability of larvae to recruit back to their natal population may be a pervasive phenomenon among marine species The mounting evidence in support of self recruitment dynamics indicates a pressing need for a reevaluation of the appropriateness of demographically open population models and their applicability to the management and conservation of marine ecosystems. 312:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is a rising tenor of calls for ecosystem based approaches to fisheries management. Many billfishes are apex predators in pelagic food webs and therefore of potential ecological significance as keystone predators. Most billfishes are vulnerable to exploitation effects especially those taken as by catch where longline fishing occurs. We developed a series of ecosystem models that serve as tools for evaluating the role of billfishes and their fisheries across a range of scales. One of those models addressed ecological questions about responses to large marine protected areas. Another developed ecological and economic forecasts of billfish responses to reduced by catch through specific changes in longline gear. A third posits the outcome of mandatory use of circle hooks by longline fisheries as a means for reducing sea turtle mortality. Changing to circle hooks in commercial fisheries has profound effects on catch rates for many fishes and therefore evokes substantial changes in food web dynamics. Enhanced catch release practices for billfishes produce an ameliorative response that reduces mortality rates and furthers the economic benefits of recreational fisheries. 314:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,314:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Accounting for species interactions is a key component of ecosystem based management. Simple models of species interactions provide a framework for making qualitative comparisons and identifying critical dynamics. A review of multispecies fisheries and marine reserve models indicates that incorporating species interactions leads to decreased theoretical predictions for sustainable yield and harvest rates and to increased theoretical predictions for the reserve size necessary to protect populations; ontogenetic shifts in interactions also have a significant effect on multispecies model predictions. While previous models have explored negative species interactions  predation and competition) this paper presents an example marine reserve model with a positive interaction: a spiny lobster sea urchin red algae trophic chain where red algae facilitate lobster recruitment. Model results indicate that recruitment facilitation primarily affects the time scale of the species dynamics and the lobster spillover from reserves to harvested areas; the direction of these changes depends on the no facilitation baseline. Overall these models indicate the importance of incorporating species interactions into fisheries and reserve management decisions. 315:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Catch in the northern California red sea urchin fishery has declined from 14 000 metric tons in 1988 to less than 1 000 in recent years. Although the institution of marine reserves is not expected to restore catch to former levels reserves at least have the potential to prevent further decline. The answer to the question of whether reserves would benefit this fishery depends on an essential uncertainty in recruitment which we model as a parameter in a Beverton Holt relationship between number of larvae produced and successfully settling juveniles. For high values of the slope of this function at the origin recruitment is relatively impervious to fishing and the addition of reserves diminishes catch. For low values of this slope fishing decreases recruitment and the addition of reserves increases catch by increasing recruitment. A decision analysis accounting for the distribution of possible values of this slope indicates a benefit in long term equilibrium catch of 18 PeRcEnT with one sixth of the coast in reserves. However accounting for short term losses due to the initial implementation of the reserves by considering only catches over the first 50 years reduces this gain to 12 PeRcEnT. This figure is sensitive to the relative value of short term and long term gains and to the rate at which reserves are implemented. 318:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,318:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Assessing fishery collapses worldwide is hindered by the lack of biomass data for most stocks leading to the use of landings based proxies or the assumption that existing stock assessments are globally representative. We argue that the use of sparse assessments to evaluate fishery status requires model based inference because assessment availability varies spatially and temporally and we derive a model that extrapolates from assessment results to available landings life history and location data. This model uses logistic regression to classify stocks into different prediction bins and estimates the probability of collapse in each using cross validation. Results show that landings life history and location are informative to discriminate among different probabilities of collapse. We find little evidence that regions with fewer assessments have a greater proportion of collapsed stocks while acknowledging weak inferential support regarding regions with one or fewer assessments. Our extrapolation suggests that 4.5 PeRcEnT 6.5 PeRcEnT of stocks defined by landings data are collapsed but that this proportion is increasing. Finally we propose a research agenda that combines stock assessment and landings databases while overcoming limitations in each. 320:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Catch and release fishing as a management and conservation tool for billfish ( family Istiophoridae) is practiced in many recreational fisheries and mandatory release of billfish has been implemented for some commercial fisheries. Inherent in these approaches is the observation that survival of released fish is greater than those that are landed. Recent studies using pop up satellite tags have begun to quantify postrelease survival rates for billfish yet the efficacy of management measures that require some or all billfish to be released have not been evaluated. Using an age and size structured population model that accounts for individual variability in growth we simulated the effects of postrelease mortality on yield risk of recruitment overfishing efficiency ( i. e. ratio of harvest to postrelease mortality) and probability of catching trophy sized individuals for three marlin species. Regulations such as size limits catch and release and mandatory release are likely to provide some benefit to billfish populations but our results show that the effectiveness of these strategies is reduced when release survival is less than 100 PeRcEnT. The management approaches most likely to benefit billfish populations are ones that focus on maximizing postrelease survival in the recreational fishery and minimize the billfish catch in commercial fisheries. 321:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Commercial yield of tunas in the central Pacific increased several fold between 1952 and 1998. We developed age structured production models that incorporate information from multiple fisheries to estimate population biomass and recruitment trends of tunas (Thunnus alalunga Thunnus albacares Thunnus obesus and Katsuwonus pelamis) and billfish in the central north Pacific (0 degrees N to 40 degrees N and 130 degrees E to 150 degrees W). Our results suggest that all tuna stocks remain above 40 PeRcEnT of 1950s levels whereas blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) declined to 21 PeRcEnT and swordfish (Xiphias gladius) to 56 PeRcEnT. Estimated biomasses of juvenile bigeye (T obsesus) and yellowfin (T albacares) tuna increased to 112 and 129 PeRcEnT respectively of 1950s levels. Juvenile albacore (T alalunga) decreased during the 1970s and 1980s but recovered to historical highs (121 PeRcEnT) in recent years. Skipjack (K. pelamis) remained relatively stable between 1952 and 1980 declined by 35 PeRcEnT between 1981 and 1990 and then increased to 68 PeRcEnT of 1950s levels. These changes generally represent decreases in top predators and increases in small tunas which make up their prey. Application of stock assessment methods set in a food web context provides an important step toward developing a method that recognizes fishery exploitation as a component of ecosystem dynamics. 322:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Community interactions alter the management actions necessary to recover overfished species using marine reserves. For example in communities where a larger species preys on their juveniles competitors overfishing of the larger species may cause prey population expansion; subsequent increased competition for the juveniles of the over fished species may impede its recovery within reserves. We explore the implications of such community interactions for reserve design with a model of a subtidal rockfish (genus Sebastes) system from the Northeast Pacific Ocean within a no take reserve. Ignoring community interactions the model predicts that a reserve large enough for internal recruitment to counterbalance mortality will allow recovery of the overfished species. However after incorporating community interactions the model predicts that two alternative stable states exist: one where the overfished species dominates and one where the prey dominates. In the community model the ability of an overfished system to recover to the equilibrium where the overfished species dominates after reserve establishment depends on the initial densities of both species and a larger reserve is required for recovery to be possible. 323:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,324:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,325:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecospace biomass dynamics models for the central North Pacific predict strong space time variation in abundances of various trophic groups in relation to nutrient driven patterns in primary production and circulation driven concentration of production in convergence areas. The model predicts simple patterns in ecosystem organization and abundances along productivity gradients. Predicted patterns are robust to alternative assumptions about how mobile organisms may alter dispersal behavior in relation to local fitness (per capita gain from net food intake minus predation mortality). Large marine protected areas (MPAs) would be needed to rebuild endangered populations and counter impacts of growing fishing effort. We expected that increases in dispersal rate in response to lower food availability and higher predation risk would reduce efficacy of MPAs as a management tool. Instead simulations indicated that this negative effect may generally be eliminated or even reversed by positive effects of fitness maximizing behaviors. Interannual variability in ocean circulation can further reduce the efficacy of MPAs; therefore the dynamic nature of pelagic environments should also be considered in MPA design. Anomalies in ocean circulation may shift productive areas relative to MPA location resulting in increased fishing mortality and (or) misinterpretation of catch statistics. 327:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Examining food web relationships for commercially important species enhances fisheries management by identifying sources of variability in mortality and production that are not included in standard single species stock assessments. We use a static mass balance model to evaluate relationships between species in a large marine ecosystem the coastal Gulf of Alaska USA. We focus on food web relationships for four case study species: Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus steno lepis) longnose skate (Raja rhina) walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and squids (order Teuthoidea). For each we present the species position within the food web evaluate fishing mortality relative to predation mortality and evaluate diet compositions. We find that high trophic level (TL) species whether commercially valuable (halibut) or incidentally caught (skates) have mortality patterns consistent with single species assessment assumptions where fishing mortality dominates natural mortality. However assessments for commercially valuable (pollock) or incidentally caught (squids) mid TL species can be enhanced by including food web derived predation information because fishing mortality is small compared with high and variable predation mortality. Finally we outline food web relationships that suggest how production of species may change with diet composition or prey availability. 330:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large dominant fish species that are the basis of many fisheries may be naturally so successful due partly to   cultivation effects    where adults crop down forage species that are potential competitors predators of their own juveniles. Such effects imply a converse impact when adult abundance is severely reduced by fishing: increases in forage species may then cause lagged apparently depensatory decreases in juvenile survival. Depensatory effects can then delay or prevent stock rebuilding. Cultivation effects are apparently common in freshwater communities and may also explain low recruitment success following severe declines of some major marine stocks such as Newfoundland Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Risk of depensatory effects should be a major target of recruitment research and management policies should aim for considerably higher spawning abundances than has previously been assumed necessary based on recruitment data collected during adult stock declines associated with fishery development. 331:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are critically endangered in the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. Here I estimate the magnitude of two likely causes of their decline: (i) bycatch by longline fishing vessels and (ii) coastal sources of mortality. I calculate point estimates of longline bycatch based on turtle catch rates from the US Hawaii based fleet and effort data for the international Pacific longline fleet. I estimate the intrinsic growth rate of the population and the magnitude of coastal mortality by fitting a simple logistic model. In the western and central Pacific coastal sources lead to a 13 PeRcEnT annual mortality rate compared with a point estimate of 12 PeRcEnT from longlining. In the eastern Pacific coastal sources account for a 28 PeRcEnT annual mortality rate compared with a point estimate of only 5 PeRcEnT from longlining. A Bayesian risk assessment reveals the importance of reducing coastal sources of mortality as well as longline bycatch if the populations are to avoid extinction. International efforts to protect the leatherback should expand beyond focusing solely on longline bycatch and should attempt to reduce coastal harvest of adult females and eggs as well as reduce bycatch by inshore gears such as gillnets. 333:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,333:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pelagic fisheries in the Pacific Ocean target both large (Thunnus spp.) and small tunas (juveniles of Thunnus spp; Katsuwonus pelamis) but also take billfishes (Xiphias gladius Makaira spp. Tetrapturus spp. Istiophorus platypterus) and sharks (Prionace glauca Alopias superciliosus Isurus oxyrinchus Carcharhinus longimanus Galeocerdo cuvieri) as bycatch. We developed a multispecies model using the Ecopath with Ecosim software that incorporated time series estimates of biomass fishing mortality and bycatch rates (1952 1998) to evaluate the relative contributions of fishing and trophic impacts on tuna dynamics in the central Pacific (0 degrees N to 40 degrees N and 130 degrees E to 150 degrees W). The Ecosim model reproduced the observed trends in abundance indices and biomass estimates for most large tunas and billfishes. A decline in predation mortality owing to depletion of large predators was greatest for small yellowfin tuna and could possibly account for apparent increases in biomass. For other tunas however predicted changes in predation mortality rates were small (small bigeye) or were overwhelmed by much larger increases in fishing mortality (skipjack and small albacore). Limited evidence of trophic impacts associated with declining apex predator abundance likely results from the difficulties of applying detailed trophic models to open ocean systems in which ecological and fishery data uncertainties are large. 341:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The size and configuration of marine reserves best suited to reaching fisheries and conservation goals are poorly understood. It has been suggested that variable spacing between reserves is essential to the success of a system of marine reserves. We used numerical models to examine the effect of variable spacing on the efficacy of marine reserves for managing a fish species with sedentary adults and planktonic larvae. Variability in reserve spacing affected catch and recruitment relative to values for a uniform configuration of reserves only for populations near collapse even in the presence of a system of reserves. For species with low fishing rates or large marine reserves variability in spacing had only a minor effect. At high fishing rates and small reserve sizes variable reserve placement had a positive local effect on catch and recruitment when several reserves fell close to each other. These configurations led to uneven spatial distributions with greater catch and recruitment in areas with a higher concentration of reserves. Variable reserve spacing can offer additional protection to overfished populations along certain sections of the coastline but concern for spatial homogeneity will argue for a uniform distribution of reserves covering an adequate proportion of the entire coastline. 348:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We used a model of the pelagic ecosystem in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean to explore how climate variation at El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) scales might affect animals at middle and upper trophic levels. We developed two physical forcing scenarios: (1) physical effects on phytoplankton biomass and (2) simultaneous physical effects on phytoplankton biomass and predator recruitment. We simulated the effects of climate anomaly pulses climate cycles and global warming. Pulses caused oscillations to propagate through the ecosystem; cycles affected the shapes of these oscillations; and warming caused trends. We concluded that biomass trajectories of single populations at middle and upper trophic levels cannot be used to detect bottom up effects that direct physical effects on predator recruitment can be the dominant source of interannual variability in pelagic ecosystems that such direct effects may dampen top down control by fisheries and that predictions about the effects of climate change may be misleading if fishing mortality is not considered. Predictions from ecosystem models are sensitive to the relative strengths of indirect and direct physical effects on middle and upper trophic levels. 362:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In order to strengthen biological and social success of community based marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Philippines many organizations have begun instituting MPA networks. In the Central Visayas Region Coastal Conservation and Education Foundation and Fisheries for Improved Sustainable Harvest are implementing socioecological networking initiatives. Educational programs employing diverse methods such as cross visits and community MPA monitoring are integral components of these projects. This article analyzes the relationship between education information diffusion and standard measures of MPA success  MPA rule compliance and fish abundance) in communities participating in these networks. Surveys were conducted with 13 individuals per community in 36 communities. Statistical tests reveal that the presence of a clear MPA leader participation in cross visits and presence of community environmental education programs were the strongest predictors of social and biological MPA success. Formal education programs  management committee member trainings) independent of other processes did not demonstrate strong statistical relationships with MPA success. Overall the findings of this study demonstrate the current and potential benefits and efficacy of education programs for communities in MPA networks. When linked to a strong infrastructure for information diffusion education programs have the potential to increase both biological and social MPA success. 363:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Danajon Bank double barrier reef located off northern Bohol Island of central Philippines is the focus of this case study on ecosystem based management (EBM). Fisheries management is relatively new in the area particularly the aspect of managing fish stocks with wide distribution patterns crossing jurisdictional boundaries. Nevertheless stakeholders are taking bold steps toward improving fisheries management. The impetus to take action comes from the realization that coastal habitats can no longer sustain the level of exploitation to which they have been exposed. The initiative is facilitated by the USAID funded Fisheries Improved for Sustainable Harvests (FISH) Project in collaboration with various partners. The EBM approach of the FISH Project is incremental and builds on existing management systems and utilizes existing legal and institutional frameworks while encouraging progress toward ecosystem wide management. Fisheries management tools include coastal management marine protected areas limitations on fishing effort and gear control of extraction of specific life stages of important species licensing zoning and coastal law enforcement. One FISH Project goal is to increase fish biomass by at least 10 PeRcEnT in 2010 over the 2004 baseline. Monitoring data collected in 2006 and 2008 to quantify changes against baseline data for key indicators have generally shown incremental improvements based on fisheries independent surveys and MPA assessments. The Danajon Bank experience shows that there are three major components in working toward EBM: (1) fisheries management interventions should always consider a defined ecosystem boundary as resource management unit; (2) there is a need to understand the dynamics of marine ecosystems and how they respond to human induced changes particularly to changes resulting from fisheries; and (3) there is a need for a governance system that supports limits to fisheries resource exploitation activities. The match between the spatial range of the ecosystem and the governance system is the most important consideration and will play an important role in scaling up of fisheries management initiatives. 364:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The growing number of marine protected areas (MPAs) globally represents an increasing interest in marine conservation and fisheries management and the potential of planned and managed MPA networks as a way of strengthening local management. This study documents the development of MPA networks in the Philippines and identifies critical success factors and issues. Methods were field observation by participation in MPA and fisheries management projects and focused interviews that gathered opinions and observations of primary MPA network stakeholders in the central Visayas region. Findings show that an MPA network is defined through social and ecological criteria. From a social perspective a network is comprised of people and organizations that manage component MPAs benefit from the network and promote the networks viability through shared administrative responsibility and information. To qualify as part of an ecological network individual MPAs must interact ecologically  source or sink of larvae and propagating organisms protection for habitat and threatened or endangered species) to enhance fisheries and biodiversity conservation. The study found that while social and ecological criteria are shaping MPA networks through science based planning integrated management and coordination there exist numerous institutional issues related to scaling up to networks from single MPAs. Issues pertain to: limiting access to resources boundary delineation monitoring compliance finding common goals and identity and conflict resolution. Factors correlated with management success included common institutional processes and legal support improved understanding of benefits from a network and improved habitat conditions and fishery yields associated with MPAs. 365:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Hawaiian Islands comprise a large and isolated archipelago that includes the largest reef area in the United States. Managing nearshore fisheries in this archipelago is a major challenge compounded by the difficulty of coordinating multiple agencies to provide governance across a broad series of islands with substantial social and political differences. There has been interest in and progress toward key elements of ecosystem based management (EBM) in Hawaii including a network of MPAs and community based co management. However progress has been slow and largely driven by increased attention to the risks facing coral reef ecosystems enabling both legislation and emergence of local engagement in fishery issues. Key elements of EBM in Hawaii include enhanced coordination among multiple agencies establishment of place based and community based (or Hawaiian ahupuaa based) co management and acquisition of data on both the ecology of the nearshore system and the role of human impacts for use in management decisions. The development of community based co management and an MPA network along the western Kohala Kona coast of the island of Hawaii (West Hawaii) illustrates a unique approach demonstrating an incremental approach toward EBM. Nonetheless there are major challenges to scaling up the West Hawaii model to other islands within the state. These challenges include (1) the limited extent of community involvement as well as legislative and administrative support of community based co management and MPAs (2) the complexity of conflicts that develop on more populated islands with diverse stakeholders (3) weak enforcement of fishing regulations and (4) whether synergy among federal state and local governments nongovernmental organizations and the scientific community will be sustainable. 366:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,367:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This analysis of marine ecosystem based management (EBM) and marine protected area (MPA) networks in the Philippines demonstrates that local level governance and institutional dynamics are central to management effectiveness. Using survey and interview data from 36 communities in the Central Visayas key variables are identified that are correlated with and predictive of marine protected area success. Empirically based management guidelines are: (1) EBM and MPA design must be context appropriate (2) capacity development to develop MPA leadership and the technical skills are a good investment (3) strict and fair punishment for infractions of legitimate rules should be utilized and appear to be welcomed by local residents and (4) conflict and controversy are a predictable part of MPA design and implementation and need to be planned for. Most importantly while scaling up management interventions can make both biological and institutional sense there is a point at which institutional capacity is exceeded. This study strongly suggests that in the Philippines and likely many other tropical contexts establishing large scale EBM MPA networks or extensive centrally planned zonation schemes based primarily on national law international targets and command and control policy are likely to fail. The pressing imperative of ocean wide environmental decline should not be used to justify infeasible and poorly designed management interventions that ignore local dynamics and institutional constraints. 369:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article provides an overview of living marine resource governance in the Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) and discusses how this relates to ecosystem based management at the geographical scale of the LME. It also provides an overview of the approach to governance reform that will be taken by the Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem and Adjacent Areas Project. The geopolitical complexity of the Caribbean region is such that regional governance appears to be more challenging there than in most other regions. The proximity of states leads to a high incidence of transboundary issues regarding living marine resources. The high proportion of small island developing states (SIDS) defined at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development as countries facing specific social economic and environmental vulnerabilities and high incidence of coastal use for industry tourism fisheries and urban development leads to heavy impacts on coastal and marine resources. Regarding institutional arrangements there are many organizations at regional and subregional levels already engaged in most aspects of marine resource management sometimes in collaboration sometimes in competition and often in relative isolation. Likewise at national and local levels there is a host of government and nongovernmental organizations with diverse aspirations and perspectives. The challenge then is to develop a regional approach that recognizes the existence of this diversity and works with it. The development of the Caribbean LME and Adjacent Areas Project has forced regional partners to reflect on the Caribbean living marine resource governance situation. It has led to the formulation and adoption of the LME Governance Framework. This framework which departs somewhat from the conventional LME approach appears to have the potential to meet the aforementioned challenge. It defines the relative roles of scientists decision makers and implementers at various levels and provides a basis for incremental implementation of improvements in governance. 373:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,376:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,377:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,380:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,383:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Zydelis . is a direct critique of 2 recent papers we published on the use of biodiversity offsets in managing fisheries bycatch. The authors misrepresent the use of biodiversity offsets as we presented them misunderstand the policy objectives of fisheries (and bycatch) management present a flawed analysis of the appropriateness of offsets for seabirds and other marine megafauna underestimate the cost of standard bycatch reduction measures and overestimate the data requirements involved in implementing offsets. __Zydelis . set up a false dichotomy between bycatchmitigationmeasures and offsets misquoting us in the process. They state we address the case of bycatch offsets as proposed by D&W where measures for avoidance and minimization of adverse impacts are not required before considering offsets which implies the adoption of offsets as a tool forces managers to leave direct mitigation approaches behind. We have consistently eschewed this approach insisting that offsets should be used only after direct mitigation measures have been implemented. In the abstract of one of our papers that __Zydelis . cite we state A bycatch management framework based on the hierarchy of avoid minimize and offse t from the Convention on Biological Diversity would result in cost effective conservation gains (Donlan and Wilcox 2008). In our initial paper we presented a comparison of whether offsets or a fisheries closure would bemore cost effective in reducing the threat to a declining shearwater. This analysis was in the context of direct mitigation measures that were both legally mandated and ineffective in achieving the required degree of bycatch reduction. The false dichotomy set up by __Zydelis . distracts from the real challenges and opportunities of integrating biodiversity offsets into bycatch management. Bycatch is not a problem of species conservation; rather it is a problem in environmental management of an industry. Most agencies that regulate bycatch are fisheries agencies whose objective it is to manage their industries so that their economic activity does not generate unsustainable environmental impacts. For instance the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service sets an annual limit on the catch of turtles in the Hawaiian pelagic longline fishery. The regulatory agency does not require the fishery to conserve turtles; rather it requires that turtle mortality remain below the level that would trigger a jeopardy decision under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. __Zydelis . misunderstand this fundamental point implying that fisheries are responsible for recovering marine megafauna populations as opposed to ensuring their impacts are below sustainable levels. This view leads to their misconception that offsets would only work if they address population limiting threats. The opposite is true after implementing direct bycatchmitigation measures reducing any other mortality source such that the total net impact is below a predetermined We mention a range of activities in addition to invasive predator eradication that could serve as potential offsets including restoration of extirpated seabird colonies via social attraction techniques reductions in human harvesting of turtles and habitat restoration. For sharks touted to be the most difficult taxon to offset buyouts of lowvalue shark fisheries or increased interdiction of illegal fisheries may be options. __Zydelis . estimate that offsets would be applicable for only 8 of 97 seabird species; however they include only species for which both bycatch and invasive species effects are major and current threats. A potential offset only has to be a current threat not a major one as explained earlier. We reexamined the Birdlife International Database to evaluate the scope of this error for albatrosses a group of seabirds that due to a negative relationship between invasive species impacts and seabird body size should have the lowest frequency of potential offsets. The database reports 13 of the 22 albatross species are currently threatened by invasive species and fisheries bycatch. In their literature review __Zydelis . also missed a number of albatross species with documented invasive species impacts including Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis) Waved (P. irrorata) White capped (Thalassarche steadi) and Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans). For instance Guadalupe Island Mexico is 1 of 9 breeding sites for the Laysan Albatross that have over 100 breeding pairs. Predation by feral cats has tripled the nest failure at one colony on the island . Given that albatrosses are the largest seabirds and thus should be least affected by invasive predators it is quite likely that opportunities for offsets are even more pervasive for smaller species. __Zydelis . suggest that offsets will be onerously expensive in comparison with other measures due to monitoring and enforcement requirements. This is incorrect on at least 2 counts. First nearly all mitigation and avoidance measures require surveillance and enforcement to be effective. For example 10 years after turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were required at all times on U.S. shrimp trawlers compliance and proper use were low (Lewison . 2003). Estimates of turtle mortalities dropped between 39 PeRcEnT and 46 PeRcEnT following a 6 to 8 week temporary closure to protect shrimp stocks and a time series analysis identified TED violations along with turtle population size as the most important variables in turtle stranding . Turtle excluder devices are presumably one of the easiest bycatch reduction devices to enforce because they are large visible and permanently attached to the nets. Furthermore shrimp trawlers do not spend large amounts of time at sea; hence dockside compliance checks are feasible. Nevertheless onshore and at sea enforcement appears inadequate and difficult which suggests the need for substantial investment of resources toward compliance. Many of the success stories for bycatch mitigation measures such as the nearly zero seabird bycatch achieved in the CCAMLR fisheries involve 100 PeRcEnT observer coverage. Second compliance with bycatch mitigation measures and monitoring of bycatch rates are often done using statistical estimates made from observing a subset of vessels in a fishery. These estimation procedures could be done at a fleet level for offsets in exactly the samemanner scaling up the number of birds or turtles killed on observed vessels to produce a fleetwide estimate. Thus the cost of monitoring fisheries to obtain the necessary information for instituting an offset program would often be no larger than the costs for other effective at sea mitigation measures. __Zydelis . exaggerate the complexity and costs of evaluating an offset program. The costs and benefits of fisheries closures and other bycatch reduction methods are readily available from past closures and gear trials and they can also be directly estimated from fisheries models. Practitioners have completed over 800 eradications and with this experience can reasonably predict their biological benefits and financial costs. Furthermore monitoring and evaluation of terrestrial components of an offset program will often cost less and have less uncertainty than marine components due to the ease of monitoring aggregated breeding populations. Bycatch is a problem in regulating an industry and should be treated as such when evaluating management options. We suggest offsets be considered for residual bycatch after feasible avoidance and minimization measures have been exhausted. Offsets need to be appropriate for the taxa at hand. Although eradication of invasive predators at breeding locations might represent a viable offset for some species it will be necessary to search for viable alternatives for each scenario and sometimes there will be no suitable options. Evidence from the literature suggests that opportunities for offsets exist. The cost of implementing and evaluating an offset program will likely often be similar to any other effective bycatch reduction method (and perhaps sometimes cheaper). In cases where viable options exist offsets could allow industries to reduce their impacts to acceptable levels potentially even reaching zero impact on a net basis without undue cost to the public or the industries themselves. sustainable level could offset residual bycatch. There is no a priori requirement in regard to the size or importance of these other mortality sources. If conservationists seek to engage effectively with industry they must appreciate the difference between their goals  species recovery) and those of industry and their regulators  sustainable economic activities). The analysis by __Zydelis . of the availability of offsets is flawed. Although we discuss eradication of invasive predators as a strategy for seabirds and mention its application for turtles we do not suggest it is applicable for all marine megafauna. Like current bycatch management offset programs would be implemented on a species by species basis  Tori poles help reduce seabird bycatch but have no effect on sharks marine mammals or sea turtles). Furthermore terrestrial invasive species have no interaction with sharks and purporting to look for a relationship merely obfuscates the discussion of offsets. 386:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although it is recognized that marine wild capture fisheries are an important source of food for much of the world the cost of sustainable capture fisheries to species diversity is uncertain and it is often questioned whether industrial fisheries can be managed sustainably. We evaluated the trade off among sustainable food production profitability and conservation objectives in the groundfish bottom trawl fishery off the U.S. West Coast where depletion  reduction in abundance) of six rockfish species (Sebastes) is of particular concern. Trade offs are inherent in this multispecies fishery because there is limited capacity to target species individually. From population models and catch of 34 stocks of bottom fish we calculated the relation between harvest rate long term yield  total weight of fish caught) profit and depletion of each species. In our models annual ecosystem wide yield from all 34 stocks was maximized with an overall 5.4 PeRcEnT harvest rate but profit was maximized at a 2.8 PeRcEnT harvest rate. When we reduced harvest rates to the level (2.2 PeRcEnT harvest rate) at which no stocks collapsed ( 10 PeRcEnT of unfished levels) biomass harvested was 76 PeRcEnT of the maximum sustainable yield and profit 89 PeRcEnT of maximum. A harvest rate under which no stocks fell below the biomass that produced maximum sustainable yield (1 PeRcEnT harvest rate) resulted in 45 PeRcEnT of potential yield and 67 PeRcEnT of potential profit. Major reductions in catch in the late 1990s led to increase in the biomass of the most depleted stocks but this rebuilding resulted in the loss of  30 PeRcEnT of total sustainable yield whereas yield lost from stock depletion was 3 PeRcEnT of total sustainable yield. There are clear conservation benefits to lower harvest rates but avoiding overfishing of all stocks in a multispecies fishery carries a substantial cost in terms of lost yield and profit. 392:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,394:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,412:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,413:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,413:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sharks and other large predators are scarce on most coral reefs but studies of their historical ecology provide qualitative evidence that predators were once numerous in these ecosystems. Quantifying density of sharks in the absence of humans (baseline) is however hindered by a paucity of pertinent time series data. Recently researchers have used underwater visual surveys primarily of limited spatial extent or nonstandard design to infer negative associations between reef shark abundance and human populations. We analyzed data from 1607 towed diver surveys ( 1 ha transects surveyed by observers towed behind a boat) conducted at 46 reefs in the central western Pacific Ocean reefs that included some of the worlds most pristine coral reefs. Estimates of shark density from towed diver surveys were substantially lower ( 10 PeRcEnT) than published estimates from surveys along small transects ( 0.02 ha) which is not consistent with inverted biomass pyramids (predator biomass greater than prey biomass) reported by other researchers for pristine reefs. We examined the relation between the density of reef sharks observed in towed diver surveys and human population in models that accounted for the influence of oceanic primary productivity sea surface temperature reef area and reef physical complexity. We used these models to estimate the density of sharks in the absence of humans. Densities of gray reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) whitetip reef sharks (Triaenodon obesus) and the group all reef sharks increased substantially as human population decreased and as primary productivity and minimum sea surface temperature (or reef area which was highly correlated with temperature) increased. Simulated baseline densities of reef sharks under the absence of humans were 1.12.4 ha for the main Hawaiian Islands 1.22.4 ha for inhabited islands of American Samoa and 0.92.1 ha for inhabited islands in the Mariana Archipelago which suggests that density of reef sharks has declined to 310 PeRcEnT of baseline levels in these areas. 414:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,423:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There are differences in perception of the status of fisheries around the world that may partly stem from how data on trends in catches over time have been used. On the basis of catch trends it has been suggested that about 70 PeRcEnT of all stocks are overexploited due to unsustainable harvesting and 30 PeRcEnT of all stocks have collapsed to  10 PeRcEnT of unfished levels. Catch trends also suggest that over time an increasing number of stocks will be overexploited and collapsed. We evaluated how use of catch data affects assessment of fisheries stock status. We analyzed simulated random catch data with no trend. We examined well studied stocks classified as collapsed on the basis of catch data to determine whether these stocks actually were collapsed. We also used stock assessments to compare stock status derived from catch data with status derived from biomass data. Status of stocks derived from catch trends was almost identical to what one would expect if catches were randomly generated with no trend. Most classifications of collapse assigned on the basis of catch data were due to taxonomic reclassification regulatory changes in fisheries and market changes. In our comparison of biomass data with catch trends catch trends overestimated the percentage of overexploited and collapsed stocks. Although our biomass data were primarily from industrial fisheries in developed countries the status of these stocks estimated from catch data was similar to the status of stocks in the rest of the world estimated from catch data. We conclude that at present 28 33 PeRcEnT of all stocks are overexploited and 7 13 PeRcEnT of all stocks are collapsed. Additionally the proportion of fished stocks that are overexploited or collapsed has been fairly stable in recent years. 425:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Trophic cascades triggered by fishing have profound implications for marine ecosystems and the socioeconomic systems that depend on them. With the number of reported cases quickly growing key features and commonalities have emerged. Fishery induced trophic cascades often display differential response times and nonlinear trajectories among trophic levels and can be accompanied by shifts in alternative states. Furthermore their magnitude appears to be context dependent varying as a function of species diversity regional oceanography local physical disturbance habitat complexity and the nature of the fishery itself. To conserve and manage exploited marine ecosystems there is a pressing need for an improved understanding of the conditions that promote or inhibit the cascading consequences of fishing. Future research should investigate how the trophic effects of fishing interact with other human disturbances identify strongly interacting species and ecosystem features that confer resilience to exploitation determine ranges of predator depletion that elicit trophic cascades pinpoint antecedents that signal ecosystem state shifts and quantify variation in trophic rates across oceanographic conditions. This information will advance predictive models designed to forecast the trophic effects of fishing and will allow managers to better anticipate and avoid fishery induced trophic cascades. 442:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,44:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,455:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantitative assessment of the spatial patterns of all human uses of the oceans and their cumulative effects is needed for implementing ecosystem based management marine protected areas and ocean zoning. Here we apply methods developed to map cumulative impacts globally to the California Current using more comprehensive and higher quality data for 25 human activities and 19 marine ecosystems. This analysis indicates where protection and threat mitigation are most needed in the California Current and reveals that coastal ecosystems near high human population density and the continental shelves off Oregon and Washington are the most heavily impacted climate change is the top threat and impacts from multiple threats are ubiquitous. Remarkably these results were highly spatially correlated with the global results for this region (R(2) equals 0.92) suggesting that the global model provides guidance to areas without local data or resources to conduct similar regional scale analyses. 456:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The recreational use of marine protected areas (MPAs) is a potential source of funding for MPAs in developing countries for instance given the willingness of international divers to pay considerably higher diving fees than they currently pay. We conducted a global survey of MPAs containing coral reefs to investigate what factors are important in determining the size of fees charged to recreational SCUBA divers. The survey suggests that a negative perception about diving fees by managers is a more important predictor of fee size than the quality of diving which can help explain the prevalently low size of diving fees. Decentralized fee systems and higher diving fees can help capture some of the surplus willingness to pay for diving in MPAs but an excessive reliance on tourism for funding MPA management could expose coral reefs to damages. 459:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ten scarid species are known from the Brazilian coast. The largest Brazilian parrotfishes are Scarus aff. guacamaia Scarus trispinosus (80 cm TL) Sparisoma amplum and S. axillare. S. aff. guacamaia has not been recorded since the mid 1980s and knowledge of its occurrence in Brazil is restricted to a few museum specimens a photographed juvenile and one jaw obtained from a spearfisherman all from the mid 1980s or before. Based on museum specimens and anecdotal accounts this species was distributed along the entire tropical Brazilian coast. This is the first account of a marine reef fish extinction in Brazilian reef systems. Spearfishing of adults has probably excerpted a strong influence on the extirpation of this fish from Brazilian reefs. In addition juvenile S. guacamaia have strong functional dependency on mangroves. Local extinction of S. guacamaia following mangrove removal and overfishing in the Caribbean suggests that the same process might have facilitated the extinction process in Brazil. 460:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Effective and comprehensive regional scale marine conservation requires fine grained data on the spatial patterns of threats and their overlap. To address this need for the PapahAnaumokuAkea Marine National Monument (Monument) in Hawaii USA spatial data on 14 recent anthropogenic threats specific to this region were gathered or created including alien species bottom fishing lobster trap fishing ship based pollution ship strike risks marine debris research diving research equipment installation research wildlife sacrifice and several anthropogenic climate change threats increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation seawater acidification the number of warm ocean temperature anomalies relevant to disease outbreaks and coral bleaching and sea level rise. These data were combined with habitat maps and expert judgment on the vulnerability of different habitat types in the Monument to estimate spatial patterns of current cumulative impact at 1 ha (0.01 km(2)) resolution. Cumulative impact was greatest for shallow reef areas and peaked at Maro Reef where 13 of the 14 threats overlapped in places. Ocean temperature variation associated with disease outbreaks was found to have the highest predicted impact overall followed closely by other climate related threats none of which have easily tractable management solutions at the regional scale. High impact threats most tractable to regional management relate to ship traffic. Sensitivity analyses show that the results are robust to both data availability and quality. Managers can use these maps to (1) inform management and surveillance priorities based on the ranking of threats and their distributions (2) guide permitting decisions based on cumulative impacts and (3) choose areas to monitor for climate change effects. Furthermore this regional analysis can serve as a case study for managers elsewhere interested in assessing and mapping region specific cumulative human impacts. 461:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ability of marine protected areas (MPAs) to provide protection from indirect stressors via increased resilience afforded by decreased impact from direct stressors remains an important and unresolved question about the role MPAs can play in broader conservation and resource management goals. Over a five year period we evaluated coral and fish community responses inside and outside three MPAs within the Roviana Lagoon system in Solomon Islands where sedimentation pressure from upland logging is substantial. We found little evidence that MPAs decrease impact or improve conditions and instead found some potential declines in fish abundance. We also documented modest to high levels of poaching during this period. Where compliance with management is poor and indirect stressors play a dominant role in determining ecosystem condition as appears to be the case in Roviana Lagoon MPAs may provide little management benefit. 462:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To live successfully in wave swept habitats plants and animals must be able to survive consume resources and reproduce in the presence of incessant variable and often unpredictable levels of water motion at a range of scales. However there is a relatively poor understanding of water motion in natural habitats at the scales necessary to determine its potential physiological and ecological consequences. Using an historic record of hourly wind conditions a depth profile and two rigorously tested oceanographic models 37 years of hourly wave driven water motion were hindcast spatially on a typical subtidal coral reef platform (maximum horizontal displacement velocity and acceleration per wave cycle). For larger waves those likely to constitute ecological disturbances around 95 PeRcEnT of the waves height that is lost over the whole reef occurs within the first 50 m of the crest. The field validated model of spatiotemporal variation in water motion provided a framework for quantitatively predicting several physiological and ecological effects of wave motion such as nutrient and gas fluxes and mortality rates from hydrodynamic disturbances. It also suggested a sharp ecological transition between a crest habitat in which disturbance mediated coexistence mechanisms are important and a flat habitat in which they are much less important. 469:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,477:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,482:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,488:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,491:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,494:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,49:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,502:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,502:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Rapid and radical degradation of the world__s oceans is triggering increasing calls for more effective approaches to protect maintain and restore marine ecosystems. A broad spectrum of land and ocean based activities coupled with continued growth of the human population and migration to coastal areas is driving unanticipated unprecedented and complex changes in the chemistry physical structure biology and ecological functioning of oceans worldwide. Symptoms of complex and fundamental alterations to marine ecosystems abound including increases in: coral bleaching zones of hypoxic or anoxic water abrupt changes in species composition habitat degradation invasive species harmful algal blooms marine epidemics mass mortalities and fisheries collapses. Fishing practices coastal development land based chemical and nutrient pollution energy practices aquaculture land use and land transformation water use and shipping practices combine to alter the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems globally. Fundamental alterations to ecosystem structure include changes in species diversity; population abundance size structure sex ratios and behavior; habitat structure; trophic dynamics; biogeochemistry; biological interactions; and more. These changes in turn affect the functioning of marine ecosystems and the consequent provision of goods and services. As both the value and vulnerability of marine ecosystems become more broadly recognized there is an urgent search for effective mechanisms to prevent or reverse widespread declines and to protect maintain and restore ocean ecosystems. 504:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,506:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Apex predators in pelagic ecosystems may play key roles in determining food web structure and ecosystem dynamics. Commercial fisheries can thereby have large effects on pelagic ecosystems by selectively harvesting apex predators. We assessed the potential ecological consequences of fishing due to alternative harvest practices currently employed in the capture of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). Specifically we estimated the demand on the prey resources consumed by yellowfin tuna and how this demand is altered by three methods of pure seining and by long lining. These fishing techniques are contrasted by stark differences in age selectivity; longline and purse seine sets on yellowfin associated with dolphins (  dolphin sets  ) capture old fish whereas purse seine sets on free swimming tuna schools or floating objects (  dolphin safe sets  ) capture young yellowfin. Yellowfin tuna predation rates were estimated froth a bioenergetics model coupled with a population model based on natural mortality estimates and age specific vulnerabilities for each gear type. Maximum equilibrium fishery catch (measured in megagrams per year; 1 Mg equals 1 metric ton) was lowest fur dolphin safe sets and highest for dolphin sets and longline fishing. Moreover the present combined fishery yield could not be sustained by either of the dolphin safe sets but could be sustained with either dolphin sets or long lining. The predation rate of the yellowfin population was highly sensitive to the magnitude and type of fishing mortality: yellow fin predation rate declined by similar to119 Mg per megagram of floating object set catch 72 Mg per megagram of school fish set catch. In contrast predation declined by only 34 Mg and 17 Mg per megagram of dolphin set and longline catch respectively. When considering all fishing techniques simultaneously in proportion to the present fishery we estimated that total yellowfin predation is presently only one third the magnitude expected froth an unfished population. This reduction in predation was unevenly distributed among prey items; the prey of large yellowfin experienced 80 PeRcEnT less predation whereas the prey of small yellowfin experienced only 50 PeRcEnT less predation compared to an unfished population. We conclude that fisheries can have large effects on trophic linkages in pelagic food webs even when fishing rates are sustainable and that these ecological effects vary considerably for different types of fishing gear and fishing practices. 509:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As resource management and conservation efforts move toward multi sector ecosystem based approaches we need methods for comparing the varying responses of ecosystems to the impacts of human activities in order to prioritize management efforts allocate limited resources and understand cumulative effects. Given the number and variety of human activities affecting ecosystems relatively few empirical studies are adequately comprehensive to inform these decisions. Consequently management often turns to expert judgment for information. Drawing on methods from decision science we offer a method for eliciting expert judgment to (1) quantitatively estimate the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors (2) help prioritize the management of stressors across multiple ecosystems (3) evaluate how experts give weight to different criteria to characterize vulnerability of ecosystems to anthropogenic stressors and (4) identify key knowledge gaps. We applied this method to the California Current region in order to evaluate the relative vulnerability of 19 marine ecosystems to 53 stressors associated with human activities based on surveys from 107 experts. When judging the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors we found that experts primarily considered two criteria: the ecosystems resistance to the stressor and the number of species or trophic levels affected. Four intertidal ecosystems (mudflat beach salt marsh and rocky intertidal) were judged most vulnerable to the suite of human activities evaluated here. The highest vulnerability rankings for coastal ecosystems were invasive species ocean acidification sea temperature change sea level rise and habitat alteration from coastal engineering while offshore ecosystems were assessed to be most vulnerable to ocean acidification demersal destructive fishing and shipwrecks. These results provide a quantitative transparent and repeatable assessment of relative vulnerability across ecosystems to any ongoing or emerging human activity. Combining these results with data on the spatial distribution and intensity of human activities provides a systematic foundation for ecosystem based management. 510:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,510:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Changes in human behavior are a precursor to measurable impacts of no take marine reserves. We investigated changes in recreational fishing site selection in response to the 2005 announcement of enforcement in a marine reserve in the Gulf of California Mexico. We used a novel data set of daily self reported boating destinations from emergency rescue logbooks for a recreational angling community from 2000 to 2008. Because the reserve system has no experimental control we modeled the data two ways to test for robustness to model specification. We tested for changes in human fishing behavior with regression and fit a fleet level discrete choice model to project a counterfactual scenario. The counterfactual is the statistically constructed ex post expectation of the human behavior we would have observed if the reserve never existed. We included month and year fixed effects in our models to account for seasonal and interannual fluctuations in fishing behavior and catch rates. We detected a decrease in reserve use compared to the counterfactual indicating that the reserve rapidly experienced a decrease in visitation. However the reserves effect to reduce trips diminished with time. These results indicate that the reserve is unlikely to meet its ecological goals without institutional changes that enhance compliance. This illustrates the value of human use data to understanding the processes underlying marine reserve function. We suggest that managers should consider human use with the same frequency rigor and tools as they do fishery stocks. Marine reserves directly affect people and understanding human behavioral responses to marine reserves is an important step in marine reserve management. 511:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Concepts and theory for the design and application of terrestrial reserves is based on our understanding of environmental ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for biological diversity and sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems and how humans have influenced these processes. How well this terrestrial based theory can be applied toward the design and application of reserves in the coastal marine environment depends in part on the degree of similarity between these systems. Several marked differences in ecological and evolutionary processes exist between marine and terrestrial ecosystems as ramifications of fundamental differences in their physical environments  the relative prevalence of air and water) and contemporary patterns of human impacts. Most notably the great extent and rate of dispersal of nutrients materials holoplanktonic organisms and reproductive propagules of benthic organisms expand scales of connectivity among near shore communities and ecosystems. Consequently the   openness   of marine populations communities and ecosystems probably has marked influences on their spatial genetic and trophic structures and dynamics in ways experienced by only some terrestrial species. Such differences appear to be particularly significant for the kinds of organisms most exploited and targeted for protection in coastal marine ecosystems (fishes and macroinvertebrates). These and other differences imply some unique design criteria and application of reserves in the marine environment. In explaining the implications of these differences for marine reserve design and application we identify many of the environmental and ecological processes and design criteria necessary for consideration in the development of the analytical approaches developed elsewhere in this Special Issue. 514:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,515:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coral reefs are threatened by human activities on both the land (e. g. deforestation) and the sea (e. g. overfishing). Most conservation planning for coral reefs focuses on removing threats in the sea neglecting management actions on the land. A more integrated approach to coral reef conservation inclusive of land sea connections requires an understanding of how and where terrestrial conservation actions influence reefs. We address this by developing a land sea planning approach to inform fine scale spatial management decisions and test it in Fiji. Our aim is to determine where the protection of forest can deliver the greatest return on investment for coral reef ecosystems. To assess the benefits of conservation to coral reefs we estimate their relative condition as influenced by watershed based pollution and fishing. We calculate the cost effectiveness of protecting forest and find that investments deliver rapidly diminishing returns for improvements to relative reef condition. For example protecting 2 PeRcEnT of forest in one area is almost 500 times more beneficial than protecting 2 PeRcEnT in another area making prioritization essential. For the scenarios evaluated relative coral reef condition could be improved by 8 58 PeRcEnT if all remnant forest in Fiji were protected rather than deforested. Finally we determine the priority of each coral reef for implementing a marine protected area when all remnant forest is protected for conservation. The general results will support decisions made by the Fiji Protected Area Committee as they establish a national protected area network that aims to protect 20 PeRcEnT of the land and 30 PeRcEnT of the inshore waters by 2020. Although challenges remain we can inform conservation decisions around the globe by tackling the complex issues relevant to integrated land sea planning. 520:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Determination of larval dispersal distances and larval origins is a central challenge in contemporary marine ecology. In this work the larval dispersal problem is discussed from the perspective of oceanography. Following formulation of the advection diffusion model the importance of scale is argued. When considering dispersion parameters at the appropriate population scales advection is usually weaker than initially anticipated (and often used) and diffusion is stronger than typically used in model studies. Focusing attention on coastal populations the importance of retention zones is described and the more general existence of a coastal boundary layer is discussed. The coupling of cross shore anal alongshore dispersion results in a nonlinear relation between alongshore dispersal distance and larval planktonic period. for dispersion in a sheared flow. Thus small changes in cross shore dispersal whether due to environmental differences or larval behavior result in significant differences in alongshore dispersal. Finally the interplay between advection and diffusion is explored showing the importance of adequately representing the diffusive effects that mitigate alongshore advection. In most cases diffusion acts to prevent   wash out   of a population and allows for more flexibility in the size and spacing of effective marine reserves. Future challenges must bring oceanographers and ecologists together around specific dispersal problems if there is to be a significant improvement in the notable absence of hard data in this field of enquiry. 525:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,527:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Four species of pelagic fish of particular management concern in the upper San Francisco Estuary California USA have declined precipitously since ca. 2002: delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense). The estuary has been monitored since the late 1960s with extensive collection of data on the fishes their pelagic prey phytoplankton biomass invasive species and physical factors. We used multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modeling to discern the main factors responsible for the declines. An expert elicited model was built to describe the system. Fifty four relationships were built into the model only one of which was of uncertain direction a priori. Twenty eight of the proposed relationships were strongly supported by or consistent with the data while 26 were close to zero (not supported by the data but not contrary to expectations). The position of the 2 PeRcEnT isohaline (a measure of the physical response of the estuary to freshwater flow) and increased water clarity over the period of analyses were two factors affecting multiple declining taxa (including fishes and the fishes main zooplankton prey). Our results were relatively robust with respect to the form of stock recruitment model used and to inclusion of subsidiary covariates but may be enhanced by using detailed state space models that describe more fully the life history dynamics of the declining species. 536:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large scale pelagic fisheries exploit a diversity of apex predators with a wide range of life history strategies. Exploitation of species with different life history strategies has different population and food web consequences. We explored the changes in predation that result from exploitation of a common species with a slow growth and low fecundity life history strategy (blue shark Prionace glauca) with those that result from exploitation of a common species with fast growth and high fecundity (yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares) in the central Pacific Ocean. Longline fisheries directed toward billfishes and tunas also capture blue sharks as incidental catch. Mortality rates of sharks had been relatively low prior to the recent surge in finning that has resulted in a substantial rise in mortality of adult and subadult sharks in the last decade. We estimated the magnitude of changes in predation by populations of yellowfin tuna and blue sharks in response to longline fisheries that involve shark finning. Bioenergetics models for sharks and tunas were coupled to simple population models that account for changes in size structure in response to fishery induced mortality regimes in order to estimate predation responses to changes in fishing intensities. Our analyses demonstrate that blue shark populations are very sensitive to low exploitation rates while yellowfin tuna populations are extremely robust across a wide range of exploitation rates by longline fisheries. Although predation rates by yellowfin tuna are 4 5 times higher than by blue sharks longline fisheries have substantially greater effects on shark predation than on yellowfin tuna predation at the food web scale. Expected food web responses will be strongest where the unexploited biomass of long lived species is high and predation is relatively specialized compared with other apex predators. Our analyses suggest that active management to reduce finning mortality in sharks will play an important role toward minimizing the effects of longline fisheries on the food web structure of the pelagic Pacific Ocean. 537:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Life history parameters were used to estimate the dispersal potential of 1021 marine macroinvertebrates recorded in species lists from 91 :sites comprising rocky intertidal subtidal kelp forest sandy beach and soft bottom habitats in Washington Oregon and California. Mean species richness was significantly greater in the California rocky subtidal habitat. Data on development mode planktonic larval duration rafting potential and adult mobility were compiled and summaries of the dispersal potentials of taxa within each habitat type were generated and compared. In summary; development mode was known or estimated for 76 PeRcEnT of species; larval planktonic duration for 49%; adult mobility for 76%; and rafting potential for 46 PeRcEnT. In comparisons of species life history traits among habitats sand dominated habitats were distinct from rocky habitats. In rocky habitats similar to42 PeRcEnT of species had planktonic feeding larvae 43 PeRcEnT had planktonic nonfeeding larvae and 15 PeRcEnT had nonplanktonic larvae. Sandy intertidal habitats had higher proportions of taxa with nondispersing nonplanktonic larvae and lower proportions of planktonic feeding and nonfeeding larvae than all other sites. Soft bottom subtidal communities had the highest proportion of taxa with planktonic feeding development and larvae with planktonic lifespans  30 d. Species in soft bottom subtidal sites . therefore have the greatest potential for extensive larval dispersal whereas species in soft bottom intertidal sites have the least potential for larval dispersal. In these sites with limited larval dispersal potential there is greater potential for adult dispersal through adult movement and rafting. These differences in the dispersal potential of larvae and adults suggest that the effect of environmental changes and the effectiveness of reserves may differ between habitats. Conservation methods including the use of marine reserves must therefore be tailored to the habitat of interest if effective protection of community resources is to be achieved. 539:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine reserves affect areas outside reserve boundaries via the displacement of fishing effort and the export of production. Here we focus on how these key factors interact to influence the results seen once reserves are created. For a settlement limited fishery export of increased production from within reserves can offset the effects of displaced fishing effort. We develop simple mathematical models that indicate net fisheries benefits can accrue at closures up to and perhaps beyond 50 PeRcEnT of total stock area through the export of production given documented average increases in biomass within reserves. However reserve monitoring programs face problems identifying independent control sites because the spatial extent of export is unknown. Efforts to monitor reserve impacts on recruitment are further complicated by the fact that large reserve closures are likely necessary before significant changes in recruitment can be detected above normal interannual fluctuations. Resolving these limitations requires comprehensive monitoring data before reserves are implemented. Fortunately studies of reserves that used Before After Control Impact (BACI) experimental designs show that control and reserve sites were equivalent prior to protection and that control sites improved after reserves were in place. Consequently any bias in our current perception of reserve impacts likely underestimates their effect. 540:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,540:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine reserves are a spatial approach to marine management and conservation aimed at protecting and restoring multispecies assemblages and the structure and function of marine ecosystems. We used meta analyses of published data to address the questions of how and over what time frames marine assemblages change within no take marine reserves as they recover from fishing and other human uses. We used 20 studies of coastal fish assemblages from 31 temperate and tropical locations reporting abundances and in some cases biomass of 10 134 species from reserve and reference conditions  conditions in nearby fished sites or before reserve establishment) spanning 1 25 years of protection. Synthesis of data from these diverse sets of assemblages showed that: (1) a species level of exploitation trophic level and the duration of protection through the no take reserve explain small but significant amounts of variation in individual species responses to protection with only species that are targeted by fishing or by aquarium trade showing overall enhanced abundances in protected areas and increasing positive effects of protection on abundances at top trophic levels through time; (2) up to a third of species in different studies (19 PeRcEnT on average) appeared to be negatively affected by protection indicating that indirect effects of protection through competitive or predatory interactions may be common; and (3) variation and lags in species responses to protection resulted in protected assemblages diverging from reference conditions with greater proportions of total fish biomass at top trophic levels in protected compared to fished assemblages. These results indicate that marine reserves are effective in enhancing local abundances of exploited species and restoring the structure of whole communities though these changes occur through a series of transient states and for some communities over long time frames (decades). In contrast with the more predictable increases of aggregate community variables such as total abundance and biomass individual species and community structure exhibited broad variation in their responses to protection. Marine protected areas represent multiple human exclusion   experiments    replicated in a variety of ecosystem types and geographic locations providing key insights on community wide impacts of the removal of human extraction. Long term monitoring of community trajectories in marine protected areas and modeling studies scaling up local effects to relevant spatial and temporal scales are needed to increase our ability to protect and restore whole marine systems and to set realistic targets for the conservation and restoration of specific assemblages. 542:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine reserves are quickly gaining popularity as a management option for marine conservation fisheries and other human uses of the oceans. Despite the popularity of marine reserves as a management tool few reserves appear to have been created or designed with an understanding of how reserves affect biological factors or how reserves can be designed to meet biological goals more effectively  attaining sustainable fish populations). This shortcoming occurs in part because the many studies that have examined the impacts of reserves on marine organisms remain isolated examples or anecdotes; the results of these. many studies have not yet been synthesized. Here I review the empirical work and discuss the theoretical literature to assess the impacts of marine reserves on several biological measures (density biomass size of organisms and diversity) paying particular attention to the role reserve size has in determining those impacts. The results of 89 separate studies show that on average with the exception of invertebrate biomass and size values for all four biological measures are significantly higher inside reserves compared to outside (or after reserve establishment vs. before) when evaluated for both the overall communities and by each functional group within these communities (carnivorous fishes herbivorous fishes planktivorous fishes invertebrate eaters and invertebrates). Surprisingly results also show that the relative impacts of reserves such as the proportional differences in density or biomass are independent of reserve size; suggesting that the effects of marine reserves increase directly rather than proportionally with the size of a reserve. However equal relative differences in biological measures between small and large reserves nearly always translate into greater absolute differences for larger reserves and so larger reserves may be necessary to meet the goals set for marine reserves. The quality of the data in the reviewed studies varied greatly. To improve data quality in the future whenever possible studies should take measurements before and after the creation of a reserve replicate sampling and include a suite of representative species. Despite the variable quality of the data the results from this review suggest that. nearly any marine habitat can benefit from the implementation of a reserve. Success of a marine reserve however will always be judged against the expectations for that reserve and so we must keep in mind the goals of a reserve in its design management and evaluation. 544:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,546:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,558:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The pun in the above title reflects two points. First marine life cycles commonly include a dispersive juvenile stage that is moved about by ocean currents. This stage often is the predominant or only means of dispersal that connects spatially disjunct populations. As a consequence details of dispersal likely play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of marine reserves as a management and conservation tool. Curiously however (and this is the second point of the title) although dozens of models for marine reserves now exist few actually account explicitly for larval dispersal. Moreover those that do include dispersal do so almost exclusively by considering it to be a nondirectional spreading process (diffusion) ignoring the effects of directional transport by currents (advection). Here we develop a population dynamical model for marine organisms with relatively sedentary adults whose larvae are transported in a simple flow field with both diffusive spreading and directional characteristics. We find that advection can play a dominant role in determining the effectiveness of different reserve configurations. Two of the most important consequences are.: (1) with strong currents multiple reserves can be markedly more effective than single reserves of equivalent total size; and (2) in the presence of strong currents reserves can significantly outperform traditional effort based management strategies in terms of fisheries yield and do so with less risk. These results suggest that successful reserve design may require considerable new efforts to examine explicitly the role of dispersal of young. 561:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,561:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The theory underlying the design of marine reserves whether the goal is to preserve biodiversity or to manage fisheries is still in its infancy. For both of these goals there is a need for general principles on which to base marine reserve design and because of the paucity of empirical experience these principles must be based on models. However most of the theoretical studies to date have been specific to a single situation with few attempts to deduce general principles. Here we attempt to distill existing results into general principles useful to designers of marine reserves. To answer the question of how fishery management using reserves compares to conventional management we provide two principles: (1) the effect of reserves on yield per recruit is similar to increasing the age of first capture and (2) the effect of reserves on yield is similar to reducing effort. Another two principles answer the question of how to design reserve configurations so that species with movement in various stages will be sustainable: (3) higher juvenile arid adult movement lowers sustainability of reserves for biodiversity but an intermediate level of adult movement is required for reserves for fishery management and (4) longer larval dispersal distance requires larger reserves for sustainability. These principles provide general guidelines for design. and attention to them will allow more rapid progress in future modeling studies. Whether populations or communities will persist under any specific reserve design is uncertain and we suggest ways of dealing with that uncertainty. 563:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,564:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,565:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,566:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,567:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This study compiled available information on the dispersal distance of the propagules of benthic marine organisms and used this information in the development of criteria for the design of marine reserves. Many benthic marine organisms release propagules that spend time in the water column before settlement. During this period ocean currents transport or disperse the propagules. When considering the size of a marine reserve and the spacing between reserves one must consider the distance which propagules disperse. We could find estimates of dispersal distance for 32 taxa; for 25 of these we were also able to find data on the time the propagules spent dispersing. Dispersal distance ranged from meters to thousands of kilometers and time in the plankton ranged from minutes to months. A significant positive correlation was found between the log transformed duration in the plankton and the log transformed dispersal distance (r . 0.7776 r(2) equals 0.60 df equals 1 25 P equals 0.000); the more time propagules spend in the water column the further they tend to be dispersed. The frequency distribution of the log transformed dispersal distance is bimodal (kurtosis equals 1.29 t equals 4.062 P   0.001) with a gap between 1 and 20 km. Propagules that dispersed  1 km spent less time in the plankton ( 100 h) or if they remained in the plankton for a longer period they tended to remain in the waters near the bottom. Propagules that dispersed  20 km spent more than 300 h in the plankton. The bimodal. nature of the distribution suggests that evolutionary constraints may reduce the likelihood of evolving mid range dispersal strategies  dispersal between 1 and 20 km) resulting in two evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies: dispersal  1 km or  similar to20 km. We suggest that reserves be designed large enough to contain the short distance dispersing propagules and be spaced far enough apart that long distance dispersing propagules released from one reserve can settle in adjacent reserves. A reserve 4 6 km in diameter should be large enough to contain the larvae of short distance dispersers and reserves spaced 1020 km apart should be close enough to capture. propagules released from adjacent reserves. 574:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,576:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We compare and contrast the design of networks of marine reserves for two different; commonly stated goals: (1) maintaining high yield in fisheries and (2) conserving biodiversity in an idealized setting using simple models. The models describe larval dispersal over a system of evenly spaced reserves of equal size assuming sedentary adults. We initially demonstrate that since populations in reserve systems can be sustained either by covering a minimal fraction of the coast with small reserves or by covering a smaller fraction of the coast with few large reserves cost considerations dictate that the conservation goal would be best met by reserves as large as practically possible. In contrast the fisheries goal of maximizing yield requires maximizing larval export outside of reserves which we show means that reserves should be as small as practically possible. Meeting the fisheries goal is ultimately more costly because it suggests a larger area of the coastline should be in reserves but it also improves on conservation goals by enhancing sustainability for species dispersing longer distances. 579:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We synthesize results from existing models of marine reserves to identify key theoretical issues that appear to be well understood as well as issues in need of further exploration. Models of marine reserves are relatively new in the scientific literature; 32 of the 34 theoretical papers we reviewed were published after 1990. These models have focused primarily on questions concerning fishery management at the expense of other objectives such as conservation scientific understanding recreation education and tourism. Roughly one third of the models analyze effects on cohorts while the remaining models have some form of complete population dynamics. Few models explicitly include larval dispersal. In a fisheries context the primary conclusion drawn by many of the complete population models is that reserves increase yield when populations would otherwise be overfished. A second conclusion resulting primarily from single cohort models is that reserves will provide fewer benefits for species with greater adult rates of movement. Although some models are beginning to yield information on the spatial configurations of reserves required for populations with specific dispersal distances to persist it remains an aspect of reserve design in need of further analysis. Other outstanding issues include the effects of (1) particular forms of density dependence (2) multispecies interactions (3) fisher behavior and (4) effects of concentrated fishing on habitat. Model results indicate that marine reserves could play a beneficial role in the protection of marine systems against overfishing. Additional modeling and analysis will greatly improve prospects for a better understanding of the potential of marine reserves for conserving biodiversity. 582:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,586:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,592:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,594:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,595:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,606:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,61:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,624:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,626:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,627:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) modeling approach combines software for ecosystem trophic mass balance analysis (Ecopath) with a dynamic modeling capability (Ecosim) for exploring past and future impacts of fishing and environmental disturbances as well as for exploring optimal fishing policies. Ecosim models can be replicated over a spatial map grid (Ecospace) to allow exploration of policies such as marine protected areas while accounting for spatial dispersal advection effects. The Ecopath approach and software has been under development for two decades with Ecosim emerging in 1995 and Ecospace in 1998 leading to an integrated and widely applied package. We present an overview of the computational aspects of the Ecopath Ecosim and Ecospace modules as they are implemented in the most recent software version. The paper summarizes the capabilities of the modeling system with respect to evaluating how fisheries and the environment impact ecosystems. We conclude by a warning about pitfalls in the use of the software for policy exploration. 633:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,636:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nearshore circulation processes and local geomorphological patterns are thought to be important correlates of spatial variation in larval recruitment of benthic organisms. However few studies have attempted to quantitatively separate their relative influences upon recruitment dynamics. Here we use 12 study sites spanning 250 km of the northern Chile upwelling ecosystem and the intertidal barnacles Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus to examine the extent to which spatial variation in larval recruitment is related to environmental variability and how these relationships depend on spatial autocorrelation. We find that upwelling intensity and wind velocity are negatively related to larval recruitment while surface slicks showed a positive correlation. However the pure effect of each environmental variable was lower than its combined effects. Taking spatial autocorrelation into account we find that the spatially structured variation of upwelling dynamics distance to upwelling fronts wind velocity and slick occurrence explained most of the variation in barnacle recruitment. Spatial variation in recruitment rates of barnacles showed a characteristic length scale of 60 70 km similar to the scale estimated for the spatially structured variables (upwelling wind velocity and surface slicks). We find that conditions for the occurrence of surface slicks (as surrogates of internal waves activity) seem to operate across several sites suggesting a meso instead local scale influence over spatial variation in barnacle recruitment. Our results suggest that spatial variation in barnacle recruitment is modulated by the combined influence of several spatially structured nearshore processes operating at scales of 60 70 km and that spatial autocorrelation must be taken into account in the study of the recruitment environment relationship. However the influence of local and small scale factors on recruitment dynamics of benthic invertebrates should be interpreted cautiously. 637:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Patterns of recruitment in marine ecosystems can re. ect the distribution of adults dispersal by ocean currents or patterns of mortality after settlement. In turn patterns of recruitment can play an important role in determining patterns of adult abundance and community dynamics. Here we examine the biogeographic structure of recruitment variability along the U. S. West Coast and examine its association with temperature variability. From 1997 to 2004 we monitored monthly recruitment rates of dominant intertidal invertebrates mussels and barnacles at 26 rocky shore sites on the West Coast of the United States from northern Oregon to southern California a span of 1750 km of coastline. We examined spatial variation in the dynamics of recruitment rates and their relationship to coastal oceanography using satellite derived time series of monthly sea surface temperature ( SST). Recruitment rates showed a biogeographic structure with large regions under similar dynamics delimited by abrupt transitions. The seasonal peak in recruitment rates for both mussels and barnacles changed from a late summer early fall peak in Oregon to winter or early spring in northern California and then back toward summer in southern California. Recruitment rates varied greatly in magnitude across the latitudinal range. The barnacle Balanus glandula and mussels ( Mytilus spp.) showed a decline of two orders of magnitude south of Oregon. In contrast recruitment rates of barnacles of the genus Chthamalus showed a variable pattern across the region examined. The spatial distribution of associations between raw SST and recruitment rates for all species showed positive associations indicating recruitment during warm months for all species in Oregon northern California and several sites in south central California. By considerably extending the spatial and temporal scales beyond that of previous studies on larval recruitment rates in this system our study has identi. ed major biogeographic breaks around Cape Blanco and Point Conception despite considerable spatial and temporal variation within each region and among species. These large differences in recruitment rates across biogeographic scales highlight the need for a better understanding of larval responses to ocean circulation patterns in the conservation and management of coastal ecosystems. 641:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,654:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,665:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,679:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,722:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nutrient bioassay experiments have been performed in many marine and estuarine environments around the world. Although protocols have been relatively uniform these experiments have yielded mixed results implicating nitrogen phosphorus silica iron and several other elements as factors limiting phytoplankton growth. Meta analysis has the potential to explain much of this variation by exploring the relationship between the magnitude of limitation and various environmental characteristics. We quantified limitation with a simple metric Delta r that estimates the change in the per unit growth rate of phytoplankton directly attributable to addition of a specific nutrient such as nitrogen iron or phosphorus. Preliminary analyses indicated that experiments lasting less than or equal to 1 d exhibited time lags in the numerical response of phytoplankton to nutrient addition while experiments lasting  7 d confounded nutrient limitation with processes such as increased grazing or depletion of other nutrients. Thus we restricted the meta analysis to results from 2 7 d experiments. These analyses showed that phosphorus enrichment usually had little impact on phytoplankton growth while enrichments of nitrogen and iron increased phytoplankton growth by 0.1 0.3 d( 1). Nutrient limitation due to N P and Fe varied significantly among sites. Nitrogen limitation was greatest in nearshore nutrient polluted and temperate environments (where most experiments have been performed) while phosphorus and iron limitation were strongest in open ocean unpolluted and tropical ecosystems or those receiving pollutants with high N:P ratios. Because phosphorus enrichment studies have been most often performed in relatively polluted coastal waters the possible role of phosphorus in limiting primary production in unpolluted oceanic systems may have been underestimated. Examining heterogeneity of responses of different systems to experiments is a valuable application of meta analysis and can facilitate the development of new ecological insights. 73:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,747:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sensitivity the magnitude of change following perturbation and return rate the rate of recovery are two key components of ecological stability. We quantified these properties for phytoplankton in lakes using pulsed nutrient loading as the perturbation. Theory predicts that grazer community structure should influence how phytoplankton respond to pulsed nutrient loading. In particular phytoplankton in lakes with large effective grazers such as Daphnia are expected to be less sensitive to but recover more slowly from nutrient perturbations than phytoplankton in lakes with smaller grazers. We tested these predictions by adding standardized small and large pulses of nutrients (similar to 10 and similar to 100 mu g P L of epilimnion; with N at an N: P ratio of similar to 25:1 by mass) to two natural ponds with contrasting grazer communities that resulted from the deliberate addition of planktivorous fishes to one pond. Site specific responses were examined by conducting the experiment in the same ponds over two consecutive summers (1994 and 1995) but switching the fish treatments between years. In both years phytoplankton in the pond with large bodied zooplankton grazers were less sensitive to small pulses of nutrients than were phytoplankton in the pond with small grazers confirming the expectation that large zooplankton can buffer lakes against nutrient perturbations. However responses to the large nutrient pulse were less consistent: phytoplankton in the pond with large zooplankton were less sensitive to the large perturbation only in 1995. This unexpected result appears to be due mainly to a 2.6 times greater total zooplankton biomass in the pond with small grazers on the day of the large pulse in 1994. Thus although the presence of large bodied zooplankton appears to reduce phytoplankton sensitivity to small nutrient pulses other factors including zooplankton biomass need to be incorporated into predictions for phytoplankton responses to large perturbations. Consistent with expectations larger zooplankton appeared to slow recovery from nutrient perturbations since the pond with fish and small grazers had faster return rates following the large nutrient pulse in both years of the experiment. Differences in life history traits between small and large species of zooplankton appear to account for these differences in recovery rates. Our results thus provide some support for theoretical expectations that management activities which alter grazer community structure may also affect the stability of phytoplankton communities to nutrient perturbations; additional experiments are needed to confirm the generality of this result. 767:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The scales of population structure in marine species depend on the degree to which larvae from different populations are mixed in the plankton. There is an intriguing trend in marine population genetic studies of significant genetic structure for larvae recruits or populations at. ne scales that is unpatterned across space and changes through time. This   chaotic genetic patchiness suggests that larval pools are not well mixed in the plankton. However few studies have been able to distinguish among potential causes of spatial and temporal genetic heterogeneity: changes in larval migration patterns changes in environmental selection or stochasticity caused by   sweepstakes reproductive success of spawners creating detectable family structure. Here we use microsatellite markers to show that significant allele frequency shifts occurred sporadically in space and time for cohorts of recruits of Paralabrax clathratus ( kelp bass) collected once every two weeks over two years from five sites in the Santa Barbara Channel California USA. We found that the pattern of genetic differentiation among cohorts was explained by a combination of ( 1) family structure in some cohorts evidenced by half and full siblings and ( 2) an indication of changes in larval delivery. It is unlikely but possible that environmental selection also plays a role. Although sampling of potential source populations was incomplete cohorts arriving during western current flows show most genetic similarity with a population sample collected in the west and cohorts arriving during current flows from the southeast show similarity with population samples collected in the south and east. Despite the family structure apparent in some cohorts these   sweepstakes events occur on too. ne a scale to create lasting year class genetic structure. The results corroborate oceanographic models of larval dispersal which suggest that larval mixing in the plankton is less extensive than previously believed. 808:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We use food web models to develop visualizations to compare and evaluate the interactions of tuna fisheries with their supporting food webs in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and the central north Pacific (CNP) Oceans. In the ETP and CNP models individual fisheries use slightly different food webs that are defined by the assemblage of targeted tuna species. Distinct energy pathways are required to support different tuna species and consequently the specific fisheries that target different tuna assemblages. These simulations suggest that catches of tunas sharks and billfishes have lowered the biomass of the upper trophic levels in both systems whereas increases in intermediate and lower trophic level animals have accompanied the decline of top predators. Trade offs between fishing and predation mortality rates that occur when multiple fisheries interact with their respective food webs may lead to smaller changes in biomass than if only the effect of a single fishery is considered. Historical simulations and hypothetical management scenarios further demonstrate that the effects of longline and purse seine fisheries have been strongest in upper trophic levels but that lower trophic levels may respond more strongly to purse seine fisheries. The apex predator guild has responded most strongly to longlining. Simulations of alternative management strategies that attempt to rebuild shark and billfish populations in each ecosystem reveal that (1) changes in longlining more effectively recover top predator populations than do changes in purse seining and (2) restrictions on both shallow set longline gear and shark finning may do more to recover top predators than do simple reductions in fishing effort. 827:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Declines in coral cover are generally associated with increases in the abundance of fleshy algae. In many cases it remains unclear whether algae are responsible directly or indirectly for coral death or whether they simply settle on dead coral surfaces. Here we show that algae can indirectly cause coral mortality by enhancing microbial activity via the release of dissolved compounds. When coral and algae were placed in chambers together but separated by a 0.02 mu m filter corals suffered 100 PeRcEnT mortality. With the addition of the broad spectrum antibiotic ampicillin mortality was completely prevented. Physiological measurements showed complementary patterns of increasing coral stress with proximity to algae. Our results suggest that as human impacts increase and algae become more abundant on reefs a positive feedback loop may be created whereby compounds released by algae enhance microbial activity on live coral surfaces causing mortality of corals and further algal growth. 850:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine reserves are becoming a popular tool for marine conservation and resource management worldwide. In the past reserves have been created with little understanding of how they actually affect the areas they are intended to protect. A few recent reviews have evaluated how reserves in general affect the density and biomass of organisms within them but little work has been done to assess temporal patterns of these impacts. Here we review 112 independent measurements of 80 reserves to show that the higher average values of density biomass average organism size and diversity inside reserves (relative to controls) reach mean levels within a short (1 3 y) period of time and that the values are subsequently consistent across reserves of all ages (up to 40 y). Therefore biological responses inside marine reserves appear to develop quickly and last through time. This result should facilitate their use in the management of marine resources. 851:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine reserves hold promise for maintaining biodiversity and sustainable fishery management but studies supporting them have not addressed a crucial aspect of sustainability: the reduction in viability of populations with planktonic larvae dispersing along a coastal habitat with noncontiguous marine reserves. We show how sustainability depends on the fraction of natural larval settlement (FNLS) remaining after reserves are implemented which in turn depends on reserve configuration and larval dispersal distance. Sustainability requires FNLS to be greater than an empirically determined minimum Maintaining an adequate value for all species requires either a large unlikely fraction (  35 PeRcEnT) of coastline in reserves or reserves that are larger than the mean larval dispersal distance of the target species. FNLS is greater for species dispersing shorter distances which implies reserves can lead to: (1) changes in community composition and (2) genetic selection fur shorter dispersal distance. Dependence of sustainability on dispersal distance is a new source of uncertainty. 890:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The depletion of fish stocks from global fisheries has been a long standing concern. More recently incidental catch of non target (termed bycatch) vertebrates also has been proposed as a serious conservation issue. Here we present a bycatch assessment for loggerhead and leatherback sea turtles that are incidentally caught by global pelagic longlines. We integrate catch data from over 40 nations and bycatch data from 13 international observer programmes. Despite infrequent rates of encounter our analyses show that more than 200 000 loggerheads and 50 000 leatherbacks were likely taken as pelagic longline bycatch in 2000. Our analyses suggest that thousands of these turtles die each year from longline gear in the Pacific Ocean alone. Given 80 95 PeRcEnT declines for Pacific loggerhead and leatherback populations over the last 20 years this bycatch level is not sustainable. Adopting a large scale synthetic approach is critical to accurately characterize the influence of global fisheries bycatch on globally distributed and imperilled pelagic vertebrates. 929:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species specific responses to disturbance are a central consideration for predicting the composition dynamics and function of future communities. These responses may be predictable based on species traits that can be analyzed systematically to understand those characteristics important in determining susceptibility and potential for recovery. Scleractinian coral communities of the Western Atlantic are experiencing increased frequency and severity of extreme thermal disturbance coral bleaching and mortality. A conceptual thermal bleaching response model developed in this study suggests multiple susceptibility pathways that can lead corals to partial mortality and the loss of biomass or complete mortality and the loss of genotypes with implications for species specific persistence and recovery. Coral assessments from annual to semi annual surveys at 18 sites in the U.S. Virgin Islands northeastern Caribbean Sea before during and after the catastrophic 2005 coral bleaching event and during the mild 2010 bleaching event were used to evaluate bleaching disease and mortality responses. Three convergent groupings of species emerged based predominantly on their responses to the 2005 event: Type I high bleaching and initial mortality no subsequent white disease and severe losses of cover (exhibited by Agaricia agaricites and branching Porites species); Type II moderate bleaching and initial mortality high subsequent white disease prevalence and severe losses of cover (exhibited by Colpophyllia natans Montastraea annularis species complex and M. annularis sensu stricto); Type III moderate to low bleaching and paling low to no subsequent white disease and low to no loss of cover (exhibited by Diploria strigosa Montastraea cavernosa Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea). Whole colony mortality was uncommon even in the most susceptible species suggesting a potential for recovery among the majority (19 of 27) of scleractinian corals studied. Type II species performed worse than predicted by species traits because of their susceptibility to disease a factor that needs to be incorporated more fully in models of thermal stress response. Responses of all species to the milder 2010 event were less severe with limited bleaching and no detectible mortality. Future community composition of Caribbean coral reefs under seawater warming will likely be increasingly dominated by resistant Type III species. 930:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or if necessary global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social ecological system with examples from fisheries marine livelihoods and water quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal the type of reference point selected and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem based management including marine spatial planning ecosystem service valuation and integrated ecosystem assessments. 945:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In many coastal locations seagrass meadows are part of a greater seascape that includes both marine and terrestrial elements each linked to the other via the foraging patterns of consumers (both predators and herbivores) and the passive drift of seagrass propagules leaves roots and rhizomes and seagrass associated macroalgal detritus. With seagrasses declining in many regions the linkages between seagrass meadows and other habitats are being altered and diminished. Thus it is timely to summarize what is known about the prevalence and magnitude of cross habitat exchanges of seagrass derived energy and materials and to increase awareness of the importance of seagrasses to adjacent and even distant habitats. To do so we examined the literature on the extent and importance of exchanges of biomass between seagrass meadows and other habitats both in the form of exported seagrass biomass as well as transfers of animal biomass via migration. Data were most abundant for Caribbean coral reefs and Australian beaches and organisms for which there were quantitative estimates included Caribbean fishes and North American migratory waterfowl. Overall data from the studies we reviewed clearly showed that seagrass ecosystems provide a large subsidy to both near and distant locations through the export of particulate organic matter and living plant and animal biomass. The consequences of continuing seagrass decline thus extend far beyond the areas where seagrasses grow. 952:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The increased exploitation of pelagic sharks by longline fisheries raised questions about changes in the food webs that include sharks as apex predators. We used a version of Ecopath Ecosim models to evaluate changes in trophic interactions due to shark exploitation in the Central North Pacific. Fisheries targeted on blue sharks tend to produce compensatory responses that favor other shark species and billfishes but they have only modest effects on the majority of food web components. Modest levels of intraguild predation (adult sharks that eat juvenile sharks) produce strong nonlinear responses in shark populations. in general analysis of the Central North Pacific model reveals that sharks are not keystone predators but that increases in longline fisheries can have profound effects on the food webs that support sharks. 954:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Mediterranean Sea has been strongly influenced by human activities for millennia. Although the environmental history of its surrounding terrestrial ecosystems has received considerable study historical changes in its marine realm are less known. We used a multidisciplinary approach combining paleontological archeological historical fisheries and ecological data to reconstruct past changes in marine populations habitats and water quality in the Adriatic Sea. Then we constructed binary food webs for different historical periods to analyze possible changes in food web structure and functioning over time. Our results indicate that human activities have influenced marine resource abundance since at least Roman times and accelerated in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Today 98 PeRcEnT of traditional marine resources are depleted to less than 50 PeRcEnT of former abundance with large (  1 m) predators and consumers being most affected. With 37 PeRcEnT of investigated species rare and 11 PeRcEnT extirpated diversity has shifted towards smaller lower trophic level species further aggravated by more than 40 species invasions. Species providing habitat and filter functions have been reduced by 75 PeRcEnT contributing to the degradation of water quality and increased eutrophication. Increased exploitation and functional extinctions have altered and simplified food web structure over time especially by changing the proportions of top predators intermediate consumers and basal species. Moreover simulations of species losses indicate that todays ecosystems may be less robust to species extinctions than in the past. Our results illustrate the long term and far reaching consequences human activities can have on marine food webs and ecosystems. 956:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The restoration and rehabilitation of the native fish communities is a long term goal for the Laurentian Great Lakes. In Lake Superior the ongoing restoration of the native lake trout populations is now regarded as one of the major success stories in fisheries management. However populations of the deepwater morphotype (siscowet rake trout) have increased much more substantially than those of the nearshore morphotype (lean lake trout) and the ecosystem now contains an assemblage of exotic species such as sea lamprey rainbow smelt and Pacific salmon (chinook coho and steelhead). Those species play an important role in defining the constraints and opportunities for ecosystem management. We combined an equilibrium mass balance model (Ecopath) with a dynamic food web model (Ecosim) to evaluate the ecological consequences of future alternative management strategies and the interaction of two different sets of life history characteristics for fishes at the top of the food web. Relatively rapid turnover rates occur among the exotic forage fish rainbow smelt and its primary predators exotic Pacific salmonids. Slower turnover rates occur among the native lake trout and burbot and their primary prey lake herring smelt deepwater cisco and sculpins. The abundance of forage fish is a key constraint for all salmonids in Lake Superior. Smelt and Mysis play a prominent role in sustaining the current trophic structure. Competition between the native lake trout and the exotic salmonids is asymmetric. Reductions in the salmon population yield only a modest benefit for the stocks of lake trout whereas increased fishing of lake trout produces substantial potential increases in the yields of Pacific salmon to recreational fisheries. The deepwater or siscowet morphotype of lake trout has become very abundant. Although it plays a major role in the structure of the food web it offers little potential for the restoration of a valuable commercial or recreational fishery. Even if a combination of strong management actions is implemented the populations of lean (nearshore) lake trout cannot be restored to pre fishery and pre lamprey levels. Thus management strategy must accept the ecological constraints due in part to the presence of exotics and choose alternatives that sustain public interest in the resources while continuing the gradual progress toward restoration. 964:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Patterns of community structure in the marine environment are strongly influenced by population relationships to biotic and physical gradients. The aim of this work is to explore the relationships of tropical rocky reef fish assemblages to wave exposure and benthic coverage in a gradient of distance from the coast. The study was conducted on the Guarapari Islands southeastern Brazilian coast. Fish were sampled by underwater visual census (166 transects) and benthic cover was estimated with quadrats (223 replicates). Two main kinds of habitats were found to be derived from the close interrelation between exposure and benthic coverage: (1) exposed areas subjected to major hydrodynamic forcing and (2) sheltered or moderately exposed areas. The first group is associated with mid water schooling species like planktivorous labrids and Chromis piscivorous Caranx as well as gregarious omnivores like Abudefduf and Diplodus. In terms of benthic composition macroalgae and encrusting calcareous algae prevail in this high energy habitat. The second group is characterized by site attached and reef associated species like territorial pomacentrids invertebrate feeders such as Halichoeres poeyi and Chaetodon striatus and small cryptobenthic fishes  blenniids and labrisomids). Turf algae zoanthids and massive corals dominate this environment. Environmental plasticity is also common with some genera showing high abundances in all habitats  Holocentrus Haemulon Acanthurus). Examples of the coupling of food availability and fish abundance were found. Planktivores territorial herbivores macroalgae browsers and spongivores were positively related with the abundance of their preferred food items along the exposure gradient. Within family analyses of Pomacentridae and Labridae showed that niche partitioning is likely occurring and seems to be mediated by swimming ability and associated feeding performance. 966:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, No take marine reserves are widely recognized as an effective conservation tool for protecting marine resources. Despite considerable empirical evidence that abundance and biomass of fished species increase within marine reserve boundaries the potential for reserves to provide fisheries and conservation benefits to adjacent waters remains heavily debated. This paper uses statistical and population models to evaluate published empirical data on adult spillover from marine reserves and shows that spillover is a common phenomenon for species that respond positively to reserve protection but at relatively small scales detectable on average up to 800 m from reserve boundaries. At these small scales local fisheries around reserves were likely unsustainable in 12 of 14 cases without the reserve and spillover partially or fully offsets losses in catch due to reserve closure in the other two cases. For reserves to play a role in sustaining and replenishing larger scale fished stocks networks of reserves may be necessary but as few exist this is difficult to evaluate. The results suggest reserves can simultaneously meet conservation objectives and benefit local fisheries adjacent to their boundaries. 970:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Throughout the world there is a general consensus among environmentalists that there should be an increase in the amount of marine area that should be reserved in marine protected areas (MPAs). In fact the 1998 Philippines Fishery Code indicates a need for designation of at least 15 PeRcEnT of municipal waters for fish refuges or sanctuaries. Such an increase in area would take productive fishing areas away from fishing communities that can ill afford the loss. The larger the protected area there will be a greater number of people impacted. This article examines the relationship between factors that influence the success of Community Based MPA (CBMPA) performance in the Visayas Philippines and their significance in efforts to increase the size of protected areas. 977:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coastal ecosystems including coral reefs mangrove forests seagrass meadows and salt marshes are being lost at alarming rates and increased scientific understanding of causes has failed to stem these losses. Coastal habitats receive contrasting research effort with 60 PeRcEnT of all of the published research carried out on coral reefs compared to 11 14 PeRcEnT of the records for each of salt marshes mangrove forests and seagrass meadows. In addition these highly connected and interdependent coastal ecosystems receive widely contrasting media attention that is disproportional to their scientific attention. Seagrass ecosystems receive the least attention in the media (1.3 PeRcEnT of the media reports) with greater attention on salt marshes (6.5 PeRcEnT) considerably more attention on mangroves (20 PeRcEnT) and a dominant focus on coral reefs which are the subject of three in every four media reports on coastal ecosystems (72.5 PeRcEnT). There are approximately tenfold lower reports on seagrass meadows in the media for every scientific paper published (ten) than the 130 150 media reports per scientific paper for mangroves and coral reefs. The lack of public awareness of losses of less charismatic ecosystems results in the continuation of detrimental practices and therefore contributes to continued declines of coastal ecosystems. More effective communication of scientific knowledge about these uncharismatic but ecologically important coastal habitats is required. Effective use of formal  school curricula media) and informal  web) education avenues and an effective partnership between scientists and media communicators are essential to raise public awareness of issues concerns and solutions within coastal ecosystems. Only increased public understanding can ultimately inform and motivate effective management of these ecologically important coastal ecosystems. 978:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human effects on estuaries are often associated with major decreases in abundance of aquatic species. However remediation priorities are difficult to identify when declines result from multiple stressors with interacting sublethal effects. The San Francisco Estuary offers a useful case study of the potential role of contaminants in declines of organisms because the waters of its delta chronically violate legal water quality standards; however direct effects of contaminants on fish species are rarely observed. Lack of direct lethality in the field has prevented consensus that contaminants may be one of the major drivers of coincident but unexplained declines of fishes with differing life histories and habitats (anadromous brackish and freshwater). Our review of available evidence indicates that examining the effects of contaminants and other stressors on specific life stages in different seasons and salinity zones of the estuary is critical to identifying how several interacting stressors could contribute to a general syndrome of declines. Moreover warming water temperatures of the magnitude projected by climate models increase metabolic rates of ectotherms and can hasten elimination of some contaminants. However for other pollutants concurrent increases in respiratory rate or food intake result in higher doses per unit time without changes in the contaminant concentrations in the water. Food limitation and energetic costs of osmoregulating under altered salinities further limit the amount of energy available to fish; this energy must be redirected from growth and reproduction toward pollutant avoidance enzymatic detoxification or elimination. Because all of these processes require energy bioenergetics methods are promising for evaluating effects of sublethal contaminants in the presence of other stressors and for informing remediation. Predictive models that evaluate the direct and indirect effects of contaminants will be possible when data become available on energetic costs of exposure to contaminants given simultaneous exposure to non contaminant stressors. 979:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recruitment of pelagic larval fishes to the nearshore environment is dependent on a suite of biological and physical processes operating at many spatial and temporal scales. Nearshore circulation processes associated with coastal upwelling are widely upheld as major determinants of year class strength for many rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) but the mechanism by which these processes drive recruitment is largely unknown. We used Standard Monitoring Units for the Recruitment of Fishes (SMURFs) to monitor recruitment of two rockfish complexes (Sebastes spp.) and cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) from March to September of 2004 and 2005 at 3 sites along the central California coast. We examined the relationship between recruitment of these fishes and measurements of oceanographic variability associated with upwelling dynamics including in situ water temperature AVHRR sea surface temperature the Bakun upwelling index and an index of alongshore surface water transport. We found that rockfish comprising the KCGB complex (Sebastes atrovirens Sebastes caurinus Sebastes; carnatus Sebastes chrysomelas) recruit during early summer while fishes of the BYO complex (Sebastes melanops Sebastes flavidus Sebastes serranoides) as well as cabezon recruit during late summer. Our results provide limited support for an association between the arrival of juvenile pelagic rockfish and cabezon to the nearshore environment and physical processes related to upwelling and relaxation. Beyond the limitations of our bimonthly sampling scheme the lack of a clear pattern may be related to the near absence of upwelling relaxation cycles along this stretch of coast during these two study periods. Moreover the settlement and recruitment of nearshore fishes may be closely tied to processes occurring earlier in the larval stage. . 1002:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Meta analyses are an increasingly used set of statistical tools that allow for data from multiple studies to be drawn together allowing broader more generalizable conclusions. The extent to which the increase in the number of meta analyses in ecology relative to other types of papers has influenced how questions are asked and the current state of knowledge has not been assessed before. Here we gauge the impact of meta analyses in ecology quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative assessment we conducted an analysis of 240 published meta analyses to examine trends in ecological meta analyses. Our examination shows that publication rates of meta analyses in ecology have increased through time and that more recent meta analyses have been more comprehensive including more studies and a greater temporal range of studies. Meta analyses in ecology are the result of larger collaborations with meta analyses being authored by larger teams than other studies and those funded by collaborative centers have even larger collaborations. These larger collaborations result in a larger scope and scale of the analyses by using more papers datasets species and years of data. Qualitatively we discuss three examples: the strength of competition the nature of how biodiversity affects ecosystem function and the response of species to global climate change where meta analyses supplied the critical evaluation of accepted ecological explanations. As scientific criticism and controversy mount the true power of meta analyses is to serve as the capstone evidence supporting the validity of an explanation and to possibly herald the shift to other potential explanations. 104:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1111:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation play an important role in controlling local and regional scale differences in population dynamics and species distributions and large scale climatic events such as El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) have been shown to affect population dynamics of key species in many ecosystems particularly in kelp forests. Few studies have been able to evaluate the consequences of climate variables on the structure and dynamics of biological communities in large part because the lack of data at appropriate spatial and temporal scales has made it difficult to adequately address local scale responses of species and communities to such events over relevant time scales. Here we combined an unprecedented dataset of kelp forest species abundances from the Channel Islands California with data for several local regional and global scale climatic variables to evaluate the temporal and spatial scale at which one can detect community wide effects of climate variables in particular ENSO events. We found large and significant local scale differences in community structure but these differences were not related to differences in climatic variables. Moreover giant kelp abundance which has been shown to be highly sensitive to water temperature and storm disturbance was a poor predictor of community differences and all communities tended to decline in abundance over the 20 year sampling period suggesting a press perturbation to the system such as PDO cycles or sustained fishing pressure. Although ENSO events can have dramatic impacts on the abundance and distribution of giant kelp itself across the range of the species such events appear to have little effect on local scale kelp forest community structure or dynamics. 1144:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A long standing challenge in ecology is to identify the suite of factors that lead to turnover in species composition in both space and time. These factors might be stochastic  sampling and priority effects) or deterministic  competition and environmental filtering). While numerous studies have examined the relationship between turnover and individual drivers of interest  primary productivity habitat heterogeneity or regional gamma diversity) few studies have disentangled the simultaneous influences of multiple stochastic and deterministic processes on both temporal and spatial turnover. If turnover is governed primarily by stochastic sampling processes removing the sampling effects of gamma diversity should result in non significant relationships between turnover and environmental variables. Conversely if deterministic processes govern turnover patterns removing sampling effects will have little influence on turnover gradients. Here we test these predictions. The United States. Continental scale multidecadal data were used to quantify spatial and temporal turnover in avian community composition within 295 survey routes. A series of regression and structural equation models were coupled with a null model to construct statistical models describing turnover patterns. Examining explanatory variables alone or in combination showed that spatial and temporal turnover increased together decreased with primary productivity and increased with habitat heterogeneity. The relationships between turnover and all variables became weaker when sampling effects were removed but relationships with primary productivity and habitat heterogeneity remained relatively strong. In addition spatial turnover increased strongly with spatial gamma diversity after sampling effects were removed. Our results show that spatial and temporal turnover are related to each other through a stochastic sampling process but that each type of turnover is further influenced by deterministic processes. The relative influence of deterministic processes appears however to decrease with primary productivity and increase with habitat heterogeneity across an eastwest longitudinal gradient in North America. 1155:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To test the hypothesis that communities with higher diversity have more predictable properties by examining patterns of community structure along a species richness gradient. Trinidad and Tobago (11 degrees 00 N 61 degrees 00 W) on the South American continental shelf opposite the Orinoco River delta north east Venezuela. We used quantile regressions to investigate how three total abundance absolute and relative dominance measures numerical abundance biomass and energy use respectively change across a species richness gradient. We investigated which allocation rule best mimics community assembly in this species richness gradient by examining the abundance of the dominant species and comparing it with predictions of niche apportionment models. All measures of total abundance increase on average across the gradient but the upper limit remains constant. On average absolute dominance is constant but the distance between the upper and lower limits decreases along the gradient. Relative dominance decreases with species richness. Observed dominance patterns are best described by Tokeshis random fraction model. Our results show that both total abundance and absolute dominance become increasingly variable as biodiversity decreases. Consequently our study suggests that ecosystem properties are less predictable when biodiversity is lower. 118:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1222:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P  How the total number of individuals in a community is divided among its species is governed by both the distribution of species along landscape scale environmental gradients and by local resource partitioning. In vertebrate ectotherms abiotic environmental conditions may constrain geographic distributions more strongly than local population densities due to thermal constraints on resource acquisition and due to behavioural thermoregulation. We investigate whether local density and species richness are decoupled for lizard communities within the Southwest US by comparing 18 species abundance distributions. While species richness decreases strongly with decreasing temperature there is no significant relationship between temperature or resource availability (net primary productivity) and the total number of individuals within a community. Consequently in more species rich communities species have lower mean abundances. This suggestion that lizard species richness is not a function of an areas capacity to support more individuals questions for this group species diversity theories based on this assumption. 1233:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Environmental heterogeneity influences biodiversity patterns such as species richness and community composition but we do not know how it shapes community structure in terms of the number of rare and abundant species. This question is particularly relevant to modified landscapes such as agro ecosystems where intensive management creates highly homogeneous landscapes which often lead to loss of rare taxa and dominance by a few aggressive species. It can be difficult to evaluate the effects of management on communities in different localities due to regional differences in species richness and composition. Because species abundance distributions (SADs) express assemblage structure in comparable units they can be used to characterize communities irrespective of species composition and for this reason provide a novel means of assessing the effects of management. We analysed the SADs of weed communities across a gradient of environmental heterogeneity generated by different management treatments. We tested the hypothesis that environmental heterogeneity promotes multimodality in SADs by comparing observed patterns with those predicted for simulated random samples from homogeneous communities. Observed SADs from a homogeneous environment did not deviate from predictions. By contrast SADs from increasingly heterogeneous environments were progressively and consistently multimodal. These results demonstrate that environmental heterogeneity resulting from variation in management treatments leaves a signature on the SAD. Our study shows that Species Abundance Distributions are informative indicators of environmental heterogeneity in modified landscapes. Weed communities include both rare species which are often of conservation interest and pose little threat to crops and abundant species which can be problematic. Our analysis suggests that creating environmental heterogeneity by varying management treatments across the landscape can be an effective way of promoting biodiversity and decreasing the abundance of problematic species. 1255:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Community assembly theories predict that the success of invading species into a new community should be predictable by functional traits. Environmental filters could constrain the number of successful ecological strategies in a habitat resulting in similar suites of traits between native and successfully invading species (convergence). Conversely concepts of limiting similarity and competitive exclusion predict native species will prevent invasion by functionally similar exotic species resulting in trait divergence between the two species pools. Nutrient availability may further alter the strength of convergent or divergent forces in community assembly by relaxing environmental constraints and or influencing competitive interactions. To investigate how nutrient availability influences forces of divergence and convergence during the invasion of exotic species into native communities we conducted multivariate analyses of community composition and functional traits from naturally assembled plant communities in long term nitrogen (N) addition experiments across North America. Relative abundances of key functional traits differed between the native and exotic plant communities consistent with limiting similarity or a trait bias in the exotic species pool. Environmental context also played an important role in invasion because sites varied in the identity of the traits that predicted dissimilarity between native and exotic communities. Nitrogen enrichment did not alter these patterns. Nitrogen enrichment tended to increase exotic abundance but this result was driven by a dramatic increase in exotics in only a few experiments. When similarity between native and exotic communities was included in the statistical model N enrichment no longer predicted an increase in exotic relative abundance. Instead sites with the highest abundance of exotic species were the ones where native and exotic communities had the highest trait similarity. Synthesis. Our analysis of natural patterns of invasion across herbaceous communities in North America found evidence of both divergent and convergent forces on community assembly with exotic species. Together these results suggest that while functionally dissimilar exotic species may be more likely to invade they are unlikely to become abundant unless they have traits pre adapting them to environmental conditions in their invaded range. Contrary to prior studies invasion was not consistently promoted by N enrichment. 1256:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Disturbance may cause community composition across sites to become more or less homogenous depending on the importance of different processes involved in community assembly. In north eastern North America and Europe local (alpha) diversity of forest plants is lower in forests growing on former agricultural fields (recent forests) than in older (ancient) forests but little is known about the influence of land use history on the degree of compositional differentiation among sites (beta diversity). Here we analyse data from 1446 sites in ancient and recent forests across 11 different landscapes in north eastern North America and Europe to demonstrate decreases in beta diversity and in the strength of species environment relationships in recent vs. ancient forests. The magnitude of environmental variability among sites did not differ between the two forest types. This suggests the difference in beta diversity between ancient and recent forests was not due to different degrees of environmental heterogeneity but rather to dispersal filters that constrain the pool of species initially colonizing recent forests. The observed effects of community homogenization and weakened relationships between species distributions and environmental gradients appear to persist for decades or longer. The legacy of human land use history in spatial patterns of biodiversity may endure both within individual sites and across sites for decades if not centuries. 1320:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper describes the responses of three epilimnetic phytoplankton communities to experimental nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment as compared to the phytoplankton community in a fourth unmanipulated lake. Increased nutrient inputs increased total phytoplankton biomass primary productivity chlorophytes cryptomonads and species turnover rates in all three enriched lakes; cyanobacteria increased in two of the three enriched lakes. However nutrient addition also led to declines in previously dominant dinoflagellates and chrysophytes and in species diversity. At the species level there were large changes in community composition from year to year in both enriched and reference lakes suggesting that phytoplankton community composition is highly dynamic even in the absence of enrichment. Overall changes in total biomass productivity and species diversity were consistent among the enriched lakes while changes in species composition differed due to variation in the physical chemical and biotic environment of each lake. This suggests that aggregated variates are more useful for quantitative prediction of nutrient effects while species responses can be used to signal qualitative differences in environmental conditions among lakes. 1340:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many models of local species interactions predict the occurrence of priority effects due to alternative stable equilibria (ASE). However few empirical examples of ASE have been shown. One possible explanation for the disparity is that local ASE are difficult to maintain regionally in patch dynamic models. Here we examine two possible mechanisms for regional coexistence of species engaged in local ASE. Biotically generated heterogeneity  habitat modification that favors further invasion by conspecifics) results in regional exclusion of one species at equilibrium. In contrast abiotic heterogeneity due to spatial variation in resource supply ratios generates local scale ASE and ensures regional coexistence with sufficiently broad environmental gradients. Abiotic heterogeneity can result in a species that is the dominant competitor over some of its range being excluded if the area where it is dominant is too small. Biotic heterogeneity can lead to alternative stable landscapes or regional priority effects while abiotic heterogeneity results in regional determinism. Broad environmental gradients in resource supply favor regional coexistence of species that exhibit local ASE. 1353:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A recent perspective paper offered by Korner essentially argued that limitation and stress are functionally useless terms for ecology except perhaps within limited contexts such as plant physiology or agriculture. We strongly disagree and to this end argue that although stress is not as precise as other concepts in ecology and is probably more difficult to apply to communities than to individuals if ecologists want to communicate in a meaningful and interesting way about the distribution and abundance of species we have to use multi purpose terminology that allows us to scale from reductionistic strictly quantifiable levels of analysis to more general conceptual levels. Here. we revisit the main arguments presented against these concepts and use three lines of counter argument to support our conclusion that limitation and stress are necessary concepts for organizing and integrating general ecological inquiry. We discuss (1) the role of interactions between individuals in changing the limitation experienced by a species (2) the importance of delineating whether stress is being applied to individuals or to the community and (3) the evolutionary argument that fitness is never perfect since even adapted species are likely limited to some degree by the environment. 1380:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We quantified the spatial and temporal variability of crustacean zooplankton abundance at annual time steps with 261 lake years of data from 22 lakes in three regions of central North America. None of these lakes had been experimentally manipulated. Using a nested three way analysis of variance we apportioned variance among years regions lakes and their interactions for 10 functional groups and 4 larger taxonomic aggregates. We proposed that relative variation in the abundance of zooplankton would be greatest among regions and lakes and least among years. We also explored how variability differed among functional groups and changed with taxonomic aggregation. Spatial sources of variation dominated the analysis but a large interaction between lakes and years indicated that time cannot be ignored. Regional variation was half that found among lakes. Relative variance components differed widely among functional groups which indicates that species will differ in their response to environmental controls and sensitivity to perturbation. Total explained variation also differed widely among zooplankton and decreased with increasing aggregation of taxa. Whether choosing ecological indicators or designing experiments and monitoring programs these results clearly show that large scale temporal and spatial variability will be an important consideration. 1392:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Functional diversity in biological communities is critical for providing the full suite of ecosystem functions and services yet the relationship between functional diversity and species richness how diversity is usually measured remains largely unknown. Here we evaluate empirically how different measures of functional diversity change with increasing species richness across 36 Atlantic reef fish communities that vary greatly in species richness. We show that (1) the definition used for functional groups strongly influences the perceived relationship; (2) when using more comprehensive definitions of functional groups the relationship is asymptotic and highly unsaturated; and (3) increasing species richness primarily leads to the addition of species to a few key functional groups rather than the addition of novel functional groups. Consequently non random assembly of fish assemblages leaves many possible functional groups empty and high species redundancy within functional groups is limited to relatively few groups. Consequences of future extirpation or extinction of species for the loss of ecosystem functions will be variable in part depending on the proportion of species lost within a functional group but potentially profound due to the large number of functional groups represented by only a single species and the targeted nature of most species extraction and extirpations. 140:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent overviews have suggested that the relationship between species richness and productivity (rate of conversion of resources to biomass per unit area per unit time) is unimodal thump shaped). Most agree that productivity affects species richness at large scales but unanimity is less regarding underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have examined the possibility that variation in species richness within communities may influence productivity leading to an exploration of the relative effect of alterations in species number per se as contrasted to the addition of productive species. Reviews of the literature concerning deserts boreal forests tropical forests lakes and wetlands lead to the conclusion that extant data are insufficient to conclusively resolve the relationship between diversity and productivity or that patterns are variable with mechanisms equally varied and complex. A more comprehensive survey of the ecological literature uncovered approximately 200 relationships of which 30 PeRcEnT were unimodal 26 PeRcEnT were positive linear 12 PeRcEnT were negative linear and 32 PeRcEnT were not significant. Categorization of studies with respect to geographic extent ecological extent taxonomic hierarchy or energetic basis of productivity similarly yielded a heterogeneous distribution of relationships. Theoretical and empirical approaches increasingly suggest scale dependence in the relationship between species richness and productivity; consequently synthetic understanding may be contingent on explicit considerations of scale in analytical studies of productivity and diversity. 144:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biotic interactions are believed to play a role in the origin and maintenance of species diversity and multiple hypotheses link the latitudinal diversity gradient to a presumed gradient in the importance of biotic interactions. Here we address whether biotic interactions are more important at low latitudes finding support for this hypothesis from a wide range of interactions. Some of the best supported examples are higher herbivory and insect predation in the tropics and predominantly tropical mutualisms such as cleaning symbioses and ant plant interactions. For studies that included tropical regions biotic interactions were never more important at high latitudes. Although our results support the hypothesis that biotic interactions are more important in the tropics additional research is needed including latitudinal comparison of rates of molecular evolution for genes involved in biotic interacti ons estimates of gradients in interaction strength and phylogenetic comparisons of the traits that mediate biotic interactions. 145:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It has often been argued that conserving biodiversity is necessary for maintaining ecosystem functioning. We critically evaluate the current evidence for this argument. Although there is substantial evidence that diversity is able to affect function particularly for plant communities it is unclear if these patterns will hold for realistic scenarios of extinctions multitrophic communities or larger spatial scales. Experiments are conducted at small spatial scales the very scales at which diversity tends to increase owing to exotics. Stressors may affect function by many pathways and diversity mediated effects on function may be a minor pathway except in the case of multiple stressor insurance effects. In general the conservation case is stronger for stability measures of function than stock and flux measures in part because it is easier to attribute value unambiguously to stability and in part because stock and flux measures of functions are anticipated to be more affected by multitrophic dynamics. Nor is biodiversity ecosystem function theory likely to help conservation managers in practical decisions except in the particular case of restoration. We give recommendations for increasing the relevance of this area of research for conservation. 1466:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Evidence is mounting that extinctions are altering key processes important to the productivity and sustainability of Earths ecosystems(1 4). Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes(5 8) but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition two processes important in all ecosystems are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments intermediate levels of species loss (21 40 PeRcEnT) reduced plant production by 5 10 PeRcEnT comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41 60 PeRcEnT) had effects rivalling those of ozone acidification elevated CO2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts(9). 1467:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, High biodiversity has been shown to enhance ecological stability on small spatial scales and over intervals of weeks to decades(1 4.) It remains unclear however whether this diversity stability relationship can be scaled up to regional scales or to longer timescales(5). Without empirical validation at larger scales the implications of the diversity stability relationship for both ecology and long term conservation strategies cannot readily be resolved. Here I show that in biogenic reefs ecological stability is related to taxonomic diversity on million year timescales. The higher the mean reef diversity in a particular time interval the smaller the change in skeletal density style of reef building and biotic reef types in the subsequent time interval. Because the relationships apply to a wide spectrum of disturbance regimes and reef types these results support the hypothesis that species richness itself promotes ecological stability(3). Carbonate production by reefs while closely correlated with reef diversity without temporal lag is not stabilized by reef diversity over these long timescales. This suggests that ecological stability and productivity may be decoupled in natural ecosystems. 1470:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Intact ecosystems contain large numbers of competing but coexisting species. Although numerous alternative theories have provided potential explanations for this high biodiversity there have been few field experiments testing between these theories. In particular theory predicts that higher diversity of coexisting competitors could result from greater niche dimensionality(1) for example larger numbers of limiting resources or factors. Alternatively diversity could be independent of niche dimensionality because large numbers of species can coexist when limited by just one or two factors if species have appropriate trade offs(2). Here we show that plant coexistence and diversity result from the niche dimensionality of a habitat. Plant species numbers decreased with increasing numbers of added limiting soil resources ( soil moisture nitrogen phosphorus and base cations) which is consistent with theoretical predictions that an increased supply of multiple limiting resources can reduce niche dimension. An observational field study gave similar results. The niche dimension hypothesis also explained diversity changes in the classic Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted. Our results provide an alternative mechanistic explanation for the effects of nutrient eutrophication on the diversity of terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems. 1475:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plants can have positive effects on each other(1). For example the accumulation of nutrients provision of shade amelioration of disturbance or protection from herbivores by some species can enhance the performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion that the distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for understanding species coexistence and diversity(2). But there have been no large scale experiments designed to examine the generality of positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative to competition. Here we show that the biomass growth and reproduction of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges we find that competition generally but not exclusively dominates interactions at lower elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore across all high and low sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low temperatures in the early summer but competition prevails at warmer sites. 1482:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The most unique feature of Earth is the existence of life and the most extraordinary feature of life is its diversity. Approximately 9 million types of plants animals protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So too do 7 billion people. Two decades ago at the first Earth Summit the vast majority of the worlds nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earths ecosystems eliminating genes species and biological traits at an alarming rate. This observation led to the question of how such loss of biological diversity will alter the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide society with the goods and services needed to prosper. 1498:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P Patterns of precipitation are likely to change significantly in the coming century with important but poorly understood consequences for plant communities. Experimental and correlative studies may provide insight into expected changes but little research has addressed the degree of concordance between these approaches. We synthesized results from four experimental water addition studies with a correlative analysis of community changes across a large natural precipitation gradient in the United States. We investigated whether community composition summarized with plant functional traits responded similarly to increasing precipitation among studies and sites. In field experiments increased precipitation favored species with small seed size short leaf life span and high leaf nitrogen (N) concentration. However with increasing precipitation along the natural gradient community composition shifted towards species with higher mean seed mass longer leaf life span and lower leaf N concentrations. The differences in temporal and spatial scale of experimental manipulations and natural gradients may explain these contrasting results. Our results highlight the complexity of responses to climate change and suggest that transient dynamics may not reflect long term shifts in functional diversity and community composition. We propose a model of community change that incorporates these differences between short and long term responses to climate change. 1507:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem engineers are organisms that change the distribution of materials and energy in the abiotic environment usually creating and maintaining new habitat patches in the landscape. Such changes in habitat conditions have been widely documented to affect the distributions and performances of other species but up to now no studies have addressed how such effects can impact the biotically driven physicochemical processes associated with these landscapes or ecosystem functions. Based on the widely accepted positive relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functions we propose that the effects of ecosystem engineers on other species could have an impact on ecosystem functions via two mutually inclusive mechanisms: (1) by adding new species into landscapes hence increasing species diversity; and (2) by improving the performances of species already present in the landscape. To test these hypotheses we focused on the effects of a high Andean ecosystem engineer the cushion plant Azorella monantha by comparing the accumulation of plant biomass and nitrogen fixed in plant tissues as species richness increases in landscapes with and without the engineer species. Our results show that both ecosystem functions increased with species richness in both landscape types but landscapes including A. monantha cushions reached higher outcomes of plant biomass and nitrogen fixed in plant tissues than landscapes without cushions. Moreover our results indicate that such positive effects on ecosystem functions could be mediated by the two mechanisms proposed above. Then given the conspicuousness of ecosystem engineering in nature and its strong influence on species diversity and given the well known relationship between species diversity and ecosystem function we suggest that the application of the conceptual framework proposed herein to other ecosystems would help to advance our understanding of the forces driving ecosystem functioning. 1508:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, No definitive explanation for the form of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem productivity exists nor is there agreement on the mechanisms linking diversity and productivity across scales. Here we examine changes in the form of the diversity productivity relationship within and across the plant communities at three observational scales: plots alliances and physiognomic vegetation types (PVTs). Vascular plant richness data are from 4 760 20 m(2) vegetation field plots. Productivity estimates in grams carbon per square meter are from annual net primary productivity (ANPP) models. Analyses with generalized linear models confirm scale dependence in the species diversity productivity relationship. At the plot focus the observed diversity productivity relationship was weak. When plot data were aggregated to a focus of vegetation alliances a hump shaped relationship was observed. Species turnover among plots cannot explain the observed hump shaped relationship at the alliance focus because we used mean plot richness across plots as our index of species richness for alliances and PVTs. The sorting of alliances along the productivity gradient appears to follow regional patterns of moisture availability with alliances that occupy dry environments occurring within the increasing phase of the hump shaped pattern alliances that occupy mesic to hydric environments occurring near the top or in the decreasing phase of the curve and alliances that occupy the wettest environments having the fewest species and the highest ANPP. This pattern is consistent with the intermediate productivity theory but appears to be inconsistent with the predictions of water energy theory. 1509:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nutrient addition to grasslands consistently causes species richness declines and productivity increases. Competition particularly for light is often assumed to produce this result. Using a long term dataset from North American herbaceous plant communities we tested whether height and clonal growth form together predict responses to fertilization because neither trait alone predicted species loss in a previous analysis. Species with a tall runner growth form commonly increased in relative abundance in response to added nitrogen while short species and those with a tall clumped clonal growth form often decreased. The ability to increase in size via vegetative spread across space while simultaneously occupying the canopy conferred competitive advantage although typically only the abundance of a single species within each height clonal growth form significantly responded to fertilization in each experiment. Classifying species on the basis of two traits (height and clonal growth form) increases our ability to predict species responses to fertilization compared to either trait alone in predominantly herbaceous plant communities. 1521:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A major challenge in evaluating patterns of species richness and productivity involves acquiring data to examine these relationships empirically across a range of ecologically significant spatial scales. In this paper we use data from herb dominated plant communities at six Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites to examine how the relationship between plant species density and above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) differs when the spatial scale of analysis is changed. We quantified this relationship at different spatial scales in which we varied the focus and extent of analysis: (1) among fields within communities (2) among fields within biomes or biogeographic regions and (3) among communities within biomes or biogeographic regions. We used species density (D equals number of species per m(2)) as our measure of diversity to have a comparable index across all sites and scales. Although we expected unimodal relationships at all spatial scales we found that spatial scale influenced the form of the relationship. At the scale of fields within different grassland communities we detected a significant relationship at only one site (Minnesota old fields) and it was negative linear. When we expanded the extent of analyses to biogeographic regions (grasslands or North America) we found significant unimodal relationships in both cases. However when we combined data to examine patterns among community types within different biogeographic regions (grassland alpine tundra arctic tundra or North America) we did not detect significant relationships between species density and ANPP for any region. The results of our analyses demonstrate that the spatial scale of analysis how data are aggregated and patterns examined can influence the form of the relationship between species density and productivity. It also demonstrates the need for data sets from a broad spectrum of sites sampled over a range of scales for examining challenging and controversial ecological hypotheses. 1527:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biodiversity can be divided into two aspects: richness (the number of species or other taxa in a community or sample) and evenness (a measure of the distribution of relative abundances of different taxa in a community or sample). Sample richness is typically evaluated using rarefaction which normalizes for sample size. Evenness is typically summarized in a single value. It is shown here that Hurlberts probability of interspecific encounter (A ) a commonly used sample size independent measure of evenness equals the slope of the steepest part of the rising limb of a rarefaction curve. This means that rarefaction curves provide information on both aspects of diversity In addition regional diversity (gamma) can be broken down into the diversity within local communities (alpha) and differences in taxonomic composition among local communities (beta). Beta richness is expressed by the difference between the composite rarefaction curve of all samples in a region with the collectors curve for the same samples. The differences of the initial slopes of these two curves reflect the beta evenness thanks to the relationship between rarefaction and A This relationship can be further extended to help interpret species area curves (SACs). As previous authors have described rarefaction provides the null hypothesis of passive sampling for SACs which can be interpreted as regional collectors curves. This allows evaluation of richness and evenness at local and regional scales using a single family of well established mathematically related techniques. 1531:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Community variability has a dual nature. On the one hand there is compositional variability changes in the relative abundance of component species. On the other hand there is aggregate variability changes in summary properties such as total abundance biomass or production. Although these two aspects of variability have received much individual attention few studies have explicitly? related the compositional and aggregate variability of natural communities. In this paper we show how simultaneous consideration of both aspects of community variability might advance our understanding of ecological communities. We use the distinction between compositional and aggregate variability to develop an organizational framework for describing patterns of community variability. At their extremes compositional and aggregate variability combine in four different ways: (I) stasis low compositional and low aggregate variability; (2) synchrony low compositional and high aggregate variability; (3) asynchrony high compositional and high aggregate variability; and (4) compensation high compositional and low aggregate variability. Each of these patterns has been observed in natural communities and can be linked to a suite of abiotic and biotic mechanisms. We give examples of the potential relevance of variability patterns to applied ecology and describe the methodological developments needed to make meaningful comparisons of aggregate and compositional variability across communities. Finally we provide two numerical examples of how our approach can be applied to natural communities. 1533:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Current evidence suggests that plants in biodiversity hotspots suffer more from pollen limitation of reproduction than those in lower diversity regions primarily due to the response of self incompatible species. Species in biodiversity hotspots may thus be more at risk of limited reproduction and subsequent population decline. Should these species have restricted ranges  be endemics to a certain region) pollen limitation within highly diverse regions may pose an important threat to global plant biodiversity. We further dissect the global pattern by exploring whether pollen limitation of range restricted (endemic) species is distinctive and or relates differently to species diversity than that of widespread (non endemic) species. To provide a preliminary test of this prediction we conducted both cross species and comparative phylogenetic meta analyses to determine the effect of endemism on the magnitude of pollen limitation and its relationship with regional species richness. Our data set included 287 plant species belonging to 78 families distributed world wide. Our results revealed that endemism and self compatibility contribute to the global association between pollen limitation and species richness. Self incompatible species were more pollen limited than self compatible ones and the PICs analysis indicated that transitions to endemism were associated with transitions to self compatibility. The relationship between pollen limitation and species richness was significant only for the self incompatible species and was monotonically increasing in non endemic species but accelerating in the endemic species. Thus self incompatible endemic species from biodiversity hotspots are at the greatest risk of pollination failure a previously unknown aspect suggesting this group of species as a top priority for future development of conservation strategies. In contrast reproduction of self compatible species appears to be unrelated to plant diversity although we caution that current data do not account for the reproductive limitation due to the quality of pollen received. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these patterns requires further investigation into plant plant pollinator mediated interactions and the dynamics of pollen transfer in communities differing in species diversity. 1537:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Failure to distinguish between importance and intensity of competition has hindered our ability to resolve key questions about the role interactions may play in plant communities. Here we examine how appropriate application of metrics of importance and intensity is integral to investigating key theories in plant community ecology and how ignoring this distinction has lead to confusion and possibly spurious conclusions. We re explore the relationship between competition intensity and importance for individuals across gradients and apply our review of concepts to published data to help clarify the debate. We demonstrate that competition importance and intensity need not be correlated and show how explicit application of the intensity and importance of competition may reconcile apparently incompatible paradigms. 1538:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fertilization experiments in plant communities are often interpreted in the context of a hump shaped relationship between species richness and productivity. We analyze results of fertilization experiments from seven terrestrial plant communities representing a productivity gradient (arctic and alpine tundra two old field habitats desert short and tall grass prairie) to determine if the response of species richness to experimentally increased productivity is consistent with the hump shaped curve. In this analysis we compared ratios of the mean response in nitrogen fertilized plots to the mean in control plots for aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and species density (D; number of species per plot of fixed unit area). In general ANPP increased and plant species density decreased following nitrogen addition although considerable variation characterized the magnitude of response. We also analyzed a subset of the data limited to the longest running studies at each site (greater than or equal to 4 yr) and found that adding 9 to 13 g N m( 2) yr( 1) (the consistent amount used at all sites) increased ANPP in all communities by approximately 50 PeRcEnT over control levels and reduced species density by approximately 30 PeRcEnT. The magnitude of response of ANPP and species density to fertilization was independent of initial community productivity. There was as much variation in the magnitude of response among communities within sites as among sites suggesting community specific mechanisms of response. Based on these results we argue that even long term fertilization experiments are not good predictors of the relationship between species richness and productivity because they are relatively small scale perturbations whereas the pattern of species richness over natural productivity gradients is influenced by long term ecological and evolutionary processes. 1539:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Future changes in precipitation regimes are likely to impact species richness in water limited plant communities. Regional spatial relationships between precipitation and richness could offer information about how altered rainfall will impact local communities assuming that processes driving the regional relationship are also dominant at fine spatial and short temporal scales. To test this assumption we compared spatial and temporal relationships between precipitation and both species richness and species turnover in central North American grasslands. Across a broad geographic gradient mean plant species richness in 1 m(2) plots increased significantly with mean annual precipitation. In contrast over a 36 yr period at one mixed grass prairie in the center of the regional gradient single year precipitation and richness were poorly correlated and consecutive wet years had little effect on richness. Instead richness increased most in wet years that followed dry years. Geographically dispersed sites receiving different levels of mean annual precipitation displayed strong differences in species composition whereas temporal variation in precipitation at one site was not related to compositional dissimilarity indicating that species turnover plays a key role in generating the regional relationship. Analyses of individual species presence absence suggest that the lagged temporal responses reflect environmental germination cues more than resource competition. These complex cues may dampen the initial impact of altered precipitation on diversity but over the long term turnover in species composition should lead to changes in richness as in the regional spatial relationship. How quickly this long term response develops may depend on the colonization rates of species better adapted to the altered rainfall regime. 1545:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many recent studies suggest that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. Community characteristics that most strongly influence invasion are uncertain however due to covariation of diversity with competition and crowding. We examined separately the effects of species richness and dominance on invasion by an exotic legume Melilotus officinalis in intact native Kansas grassland. We manipulated dominance of C 4 grasses by reducing their abundance  ramet densities) by similar to25 and 50 PeRcEnT. In addition richness was reduced by removing species that were mainly rare and uncommon as might be expected with environmental changes such as drought and fragmentation. In both years of the study (2001 2002) invasibility measured as peak establishment of Melilotus was not affected by a 3 fold reduction in species richness nor was there an interaction between loss of species and reduced dominance on invasion. In contrast reductions in abundance of the dominants significantly reduced invasibility of the grassland plots in both years. Because the abundance of dominants was highly correlated with measures of competition  ratio of dominant biomass to total biomass) and crowding (total stem densities) this pattern was opposite to that expected if competition were indeed limiting invasion. Rather invasion appeared to be facilitated by the dominant species most likely because reduced dominance increased environmental stress. Our results suggest that dominance is the key community characteristic determining invasibility because highly competitive and space filling species can either enhance or reduce susceptibility to invasion depending on whether dominants create a more competitive environment or alleviate stressful conditions. 1551:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plant communities have traditionally been viewed as either a random collection of individuals or as organismal entities. For most ecologists however neither perspective provides a modern comprehensive view of plant communities but we have yet to formalize the view that we currently hold. Here we assert that an explicit re consideration of formal community theory must incorporate interactions that have recently been prominent in plant ecology namely facilitation and indirect effects among competitors. These interactions do not suppport the traditional individualistic perspective. We believe that rejecting strict individualistic theory will allow ecologists to better explain variation occurring at different spatial scales synthesize more general predictive theories of community dynamics and develop models for community level responses to global change. Here we introduce the concept of the integrated community (IC) which proposes that natural plant communities range from highly individualistic to highly interdependent depending on synergism among: (i) stochastic processes (ii) the abiotic tolerances of species (iii) positive and negative interactions among plants and (iv) indirect interactions within and between trophic levels. All of these processes are well accepted by plant ecologists but no single theory has sought to integrate these different processes into our concept of communities. 1559:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The role of interspecific competition in structuring communities has been a highly debated issue for the last two decades. The nonrandom nature of morphological patterns within communities has been at the center of this controversy. Null models addressing community wide dispersions in morphology have produced equivocal results and may be based on assumptions that are too restrictive  competitive exclusion or displacement). If morphological distinctiveness allows species to escape competitive pressures and exhibit higher densities then a positive relationship should exist between morphological dissimilarity and abundance. We develop a suite of models that evaluates patterns in abundance that are associated with the morphological proximity of a species to other competitors. We evaluated the relationship between morphological distance and abundance from a variety of morphological perspectives from those representing strictly diffuse interactions to those representing only interactions between a species and its nearest neighbor in morphological space. These models were sufficiently powerful to detect positive associations between abundance and morphological differences in a nocturnal desert rodent guild for which the effects of competition on structure are well established. Models such as these may be more useful than traditional models evaluating morphological dispersions for many reasons. They do not require that communities reach equilibrium before competitive interactions give rise to deterministic structure. They do not suffer from limitations of potentially inaccurate faunal pools or from phylogenetic constraints. Lastly they may be used as a diagnostic tool in comparative studies to determine the degree to which competitive interactions structure communities. 1560:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The strength of interactions among species in a network tends to be highly asymmetric. We evaluate the hypothesis that this asymmetry results from the distribution of abundance among species so that species interactions occur randomly among individuals. We used a database on mutualistic and antagonistic bipartite quantitative interaction networks. We show that across all types of networks asymmetry was correlated with abundance so that rare species were asymmetrically affected by their abundant partners while pairs of interacting abundant species tended to exhibit more symmetric reciprocally strong effects. A null model shows that abundance provides a sufficient explanation of the asymmetry structure in some networks but suggests the role of additional factors in others. Although not universal our hypothesis holds for a substantial fraction of networks analyzed here and should be considered as a null model in all studies aimed at evaluating the ecological and evolutionary consequences of species interactions. 1564:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the role of competitive interactions in shaping the structure of communities has been one the most unrelenting challenges to ecology. Traditionally competitive interactions were assumed to be the most important agent of deterministic structure with overdispersed morphological patterns based on body size and trophic status as their hallmark. However models of community organization based solely on morphology have yielded only equivocal results for many taxa. Fortunately morphological patterns may not be the only indications of competitively induced deterministic structure. Herein we explore the degree to which the structure of five feeding guilds (aerial insectivores Frugivores gleaning animalivores molossid insectivores and nectarivores) from 15 New World bat communities reflects density compensation. Nonrandom associations between abundance and morphological distance were detected in five communities in three feeding guilds and with respect to four competitive scenarios. Nonetheless patterns consistent with the hypothesis of density compensation were neither pervasive nor consistent in New World bat communities. Competitively induced community structure may exist under only narrow temporal and environmental conditions and may not be characteristic of organization in most situations. 1567:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a spatially explicit generalization of Hubbells model of community dynamics in which the assumption of neutrality is relaxed by incorporating dispersal limitation and habitat preference. In simulations diversity and species abundances were governed by the rate at which new species were introduced (usually called speciation) and nearly unaffected by dispersal limitation and habitat preference. Of course in the absence of species input diversity is maintained solely by niche differences. We conclude that the success of the neutral model in predicting the abundance distribution has nothing to do with neutrality but rather with the species introduction process: when new species enter a community regularly as singletons the typical J shaped abundance distribution with a long tail of rare species is always observed whether species differ in habitat preferences or not. We suggest that many communities are indeed driven by the introduction process accounting for high diversity and rarity and that species differences may be largely irrelevant for either. 1568:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, While well recognized as an important kind of ecological interaction physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is diverse with varied consequences presenting challenges for developing and using general understanding. There is also still some uncertainty as to what it is and some skepticism that the diversity of engineering and its effects is amenable to conceptual integration and general understanding. What then are the key cause effect relationships and what underlies them? Here we develop enrich and extend our extant understanding of physical ecosystem engineering into an integrated framework that exposes the essential cause effect relationships their underpinnings and the interconnections that need to be understood to explain or predict engineering effects. The framework has four cause effect relationships linking four components: 1. An engineer causes structural change; Structural change causes abiotic change; Structural and abiotic change cause biotic change; Structural abiotic and biotic change can feedback to the engineer. The first two relationships describe an ecosystem engineering process and abiotic dynamics while the second two describe biotic consequence for other species and the engineer. The four relationships can be parameterized and linked using time indexed equations that describe engineered system dynamics. After describing the relationships we discuss the utility of the framework; how it might be enriched; and briefly how it can be used to identify intersections of ecosystem engineering with fields outside ecology. 1582:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this paper I examine the dynamics of species richness in a model system in which multiple species compete in a metacommunity (multiple patches linked by dispersal). Patches lie along an environmental gradient and new species are introduced into the system by speciation of existing species. This model is used to explore how the ecological similarity of species influences the patterns in community structure that result and to determine whether patterns in fossil and systematics data may be signatures for different types of community structure. Making species more similar overall along the entire gradient or making new species that have more similar optimal positions along the gradient to their progenitor both increase the time required to drive species extinction. As a result making species more similar ecologically to one another increases overall species richness because of an increased frequency of transient species in the system. Having more transient species in systems shifted the longevity distributions of species in the fossil record towards having a greater frequency of shorter duration species and the age distribution of extant species that would be estimated from molecular phylogenies also had a higher frequency of younger aged species. Comparisons of these results with species longevity distributions extracted from two data sets and with species ages derived from species level molecular phylogenies strongly suggest that transient species are an important component of real biological communities. 15:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Alpine plant communities are particularly amenable to experimentally test the stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) which predicts that competitive interactions will be more frequent in relatively productive environments whereas facilitation will be more common in severe systems. Experimental testing of the SGH along latitudinal and elevation gradients within and across continents indicated that particular climatic variables act as drivers of plant plant interactions and community structure. However the SGH in its current form remains a general framework that does not link explicitly climate variables such as temperature and precipitation to plant interactions or diversity. Here we re analyse our published data in order to explore whether climate can regulate biotic interactions and species diversity in alpine communities. We applied PCA to meteorological data introduced latitude as a variable and also used specially developed composite variables that combine temperature and precipitation during the growing season. The intensity of competitive interactions at low elevations decreased with increasing latitude whereas the intensity of facilitative interactions at higher elevations did not vary with latitude. Micro scale spatial patterns followed the same trend indicating that plant plant interactions could generate these patterns. These findings specify the role of temperature in shifting the balance of plant interactions and can be readily incorporated in the SGH. We also found that species richness correlated positively with a composite climate variable which is the product of maximum temperature and precipitation. Inclusion of this finding into the SGH will however need further studies focusing on the importance of water energy relations for the dynamic balance of facilitation and competition. 1614:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Long term diversity equilibria ecological incumbency and widespread recurrent fossil assemblages have each been cited as evidence that local processes such as competition played an important role in structuring communities over geologic time. We analyze the relationship between local and regional diversity in tropical marine communities spanning approximately 13 Myr of the Late Ordovician to test for the role of local processes in structuring local communities. We find a significant and strong positive relationship between local and regional diversity indicating that local communities were not saturated with species and that local processes did not exert a dominant influence on local diversity. Rather local diversity was influenced more by regional oceanographic processes that governed the size of the regional species pool. This evidence for unsaturated communities is consistent with the Walker and Valentine hierarchically structured niche model of global diversification. These results come at the beginning of the 200 Myr Paleozoic plateau in both local and global diversity and therefore raise the question whether local communities were ever saturated with species during the Paleozoic. Similar studies need to be conducted during other times in the Paleozoic to determine if this is indeed the case. 1640:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biogenic habitat creation refers to the ability of some organisms to create maintain or destroy habitats. These habitat changes affect species diversity of natural communities but it remains to be elucidated if this process also affects the link between ecosystem functions and species diversity. Based on the widely accepted positive relationships between ecosystem functions and species diversity we hypothesize that these relationships should be different in biogenically created habitat patches as compared to unmodified habitat patches. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the effects of a high Andean cushion plant Azorella madreporica which creates habitat patches with different environmental conditions than in the surrounding open areas with reduced vegetation cover. We used observational and experimental approaches to compare the plant biomass species richness relationships between habitat patches created by A. madreporica cushions and the surrounding habitat without cushion plants. The observational assessment of these relationships was conducted by counting and collecting plant species within and outside cushion patches. In the experiment species richness was manipulated within and outside cushion patches. The cushion plant itself was not included in these approaches because we were interested in measuring its effects. Results of both approaches indicated that for a given level of species richness plant biomass within cushions was higher than in the surrounding open areas. Furthermore both approaches indicated that the shape of plant biomass species richness curves differed between these habitat types. These findings suggest that habitat modifications performed by A. madreporica cushions would be positively affecting the relationships between ecosystem functions and species diversity.

Here we explore the role that this temporal turnover plays in maintaining assemblage diversity. We investigate a three decade time series of estuarine fishes and show that the abundances of the individual species fluctuate asynchronously around their mean levels. We then use a time series modelling approach to examine the consequences of different patterns of turnover by asking how the correlation between the abundance of a species in a given year and its abundance in the previous year influences the structure of the overall assemblage. Classical diversity measures that ignore species identities reveal that the observed assemblage structure will persist under all but the most extreme conditions. However metrics that track species identities indicate a narrower set of turnover scenarios under which the predicted assemblage resembles the natural one. Our study suggests that species diversity metrics are insensitive to change and that measures that track species ranks may provide better early warning that an assemblage is being perturbed. It also highlights the need to incorporate temporal turnover in investigations of assemblage structure and function. 1652:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Underlying the diversity of life and the complexity of ecology is order that reflects the operation of fundamental physical and biological processes. Power laws describe empirical scaling relationships that are emergent quantitative features of biodiversity. These features are patterns of structure or dynamics that are self similar or fractal like over many orders of magnitude. Power laws allow extrapolation and prediction over a wide range of scales. Some appear to be universal occurring in virtually all taxa of organisms and types of environments. They offer clues to underlying mechanisms that powerfully constrain biodiversity. We describe recent progress and future prospects for understanding the mechanisms that generate these power laws and for explaining the diversity of species and complexity of ecosystems in terms of fundamental principles of physical and biological science. 1664:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Previous studies have shown that variations in environmental conditions play a major role in explaining variations in plant species richness at community and landscape scales. In this study we considered the degree to which fine scale spatial variations in richness could be related to fine scale variations in abiotic and biotic factors. To examine spatial variation in richness grids of 1 m(2) plots were laid out at five sites within a coastal riverine wetland landscape. At each site a 5 x 7 array of plots was established adjacent to the rivers edge with plots one meter apart. In addition to the estimation of species richness environmental measurements included sediment salinity plot microelevation percent of plot recently disturbed and estimated community biomass. Our analysis strategy was to combine the use of structural equation modeling (path modeling) with an assessment of spatial association. Mantels tests revealed significant spatial autocorrelation in species richness at four of the five sites sampled indicating that richness in a plot correlated with the richness of nearby plots. We subsequently considered the degree to which spatial autocorrelations in richness could be explained by spatial autocorrelations in environmental conditions. Once data were corrected for environmental correlations spatial autocorrelation in residual species richness could not be detected at any site. Based on these results we conclude that in this coastal wetland there appears to be a fine scale mapping of diversity to microgradients in environmental conditions. 1665:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is little consensus on the form of the relationship between biodiversity and productivity and most of the research examining it has been done in temperate grasslands with arid ecosystems receiving comparatively little attention. Using 9 years of data collected using standardized sampling methods from five different community types in the Chihuahuan Desert (Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research site New Mexico USA) we evaluate the relationship between productivity and species richness at multiple spatial scales. The relationship was consistently unimodal at the largest scale considered; however community types differed in both the form of the relationship and the degree to which patterns fluctuated over time. Although significant linear and unimodal patterns were evident these models fit poorly suggesting that annual primary productivity is a weak predictor of mean species richness in arid communities. We suggest that productivity diversity relationships are best described by a boundary that places an upper limit on species coexistence across the gradient of productivity for a site. This upper limit often appears to be maximized at intermediate levels of productivity but it has relatively few points on the downward portion of the boundary. By focusing efforts on characterizing boundaries approaches should be developed to determine the factors that are reducing species richness compared to what would be expected given the level of productivity. 1736:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, How expected increases in climate variability will affect species diversity depends on the role of such variability in regulating the coexistence of competing species. Despite theory linking temporal environmental fluctuations with the maintenance of diversity the importance of climate variability for stabilizing coexistence remains unknown because of a lack of appropriate long term observations. Here we analyze three decades of demographic data from a Kansas prairie to demonstrate that interannual climate variability promotes the coexistence of three common grass species. Specifically we show that (i) the dynamics of the three species satisfy all requirements of   storage effect   theory based on recruitment variability with overlapping generations (it) climate variables are correlated with interannual variation in species performance and (fit) temporal variability increases low density growth rates buffering these species against competitive exclusion. Given that environmental fluctuations are ubiquitous in natural systems our results suggest that coexistence based on the storage effect may be underappreciated and could provide an important alternative to recent neutral theories of diversity. Field evidence for positive effects of variability on coexistence also emphasizes the need to consider changes in both climate means and variances when forecasting the effects of global change on species diversity. 1738:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In population ecology there has been a fundamental controversy about the relative importance of competition driven (density dependent) population regulation vs. abiotic influences such as temperature and precipitation. The same issue arises at the community level; are population sizes driven primarily by changes in the abundances of cooccurring competitors  compensatory dynamics) or do most species have a common response to environmental factors? Competitive interactions have had a central place in ecological theory dating back to Gleason Volterra Hutchison and MacArthur and more recently Hubbells influential unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. If competitive interactions are important in driving year to year fluctuations in abundance then changes in the abundance of one species should generally be accompanied by compensatory changes in the abundances of others. Thus one necessary consequence of strong compensatory forces is that on average species within communities will covary negatively. Here we use measures of community covariance to assess the prevalence of negative covariance in 41 natural communities comprising different taxa at a range of spatial scales. We found that species in natural communities tended to covary positively rather than negatively the opposite of what would be expected if compensatory dynamics were important. These findings suggest that abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation are more important than competitive interactions in driving year to year fluctuations in species abundance within communities. 1746:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Loss of biological diversity because of extinction is one of the most pronounced changes to the global environment. For several decades researchers have tried to understand how changes in biodiversity might impact biomass production by examining how biomass correlates with a number of biodiversity metrics (especially the number of species and functional groups). This body of research has focused on species with the implicit assumption that they are independent entities. However functional and ecological similarities are shaped by patterns of common ancestry such that distantly related species might contribute more to production than close relatives perhaps by increasing niche breadth. Here we analyze 2 decades of experiments performed in grassland ecosystems throughout the world and examine whether the evolutionary relationships among the species comprising a community predict how biodiversity impacts plant biomass production. We show that the amount of phylogenetic diversity within communities explained significantly more variation in plant community biomass than other measures of diversity such as the number of species or functional groups. Our results reveal how evolutionary history can provide critical information for understanding predicting and potentially ameliorating the effects of biodiversity loss and should serve as an impetus for new biodiversity experiments. 1755:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nonhierarchical competition between species has been proposed as a potential mechanism for biodiversity maintenance but theoretical and empirical research has thus far concentrated on systems composed of relatively few species. Here we develop a theory of biodiversity based on a network representation of competition for systems with large numbers of competitors. All species pairs are connected by an arrow from the inferior to the superior. Using game theory we show how the equilibrium density of all species can be derived from the structure of the network. We show that when species are limited by multiple factors the coexistence of a large number of species is the most probable outcome and that habitat heterogeneity interacts with network structure to favor diversity. 1783:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a theoretical framework to describe stochastic size structured community assembly and use this framework to make community level ecological predictions. Our model can be thought of as adding biological realism to Neutral Biodiversity Theory by incorporating size variation and growth dynamics and allowing demographic rates to depend on the sizes of individuals. We find that the species abundance distribution (SAD) is insensitive to the details of the size structure in our model demonstrating that the SAD is a poor indicator of size dependent processes. We also derive the species biomass distribution (SBD) and find that the form of the SBD depends on the underlying size structure. This leads to a prescription for testing multiple intertwined ecological predictions of the model and provides evidence that alternatives to the traditional SAD are more closely tied to certain ecological processes. Finally we describe how our framework may be extended to make predictions for more general types of community structure. 1795:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,Explaining the mechanisms that produce the enormous diversity within and between tropical tree communities is a pressing challenge for plant community ecologists. Mechanistic hypotheses range from niche based deterministic to dispersal based stochastic models. Strong tests of these hypotheses require detailed information regarding the functional strategies of species. A few tropical studies to date have examined trait dispersion within individual forest plots using species trait means in order to ask whether coexisting species tend to be more or less functionally similar than expected given a null model. The present work takes an alternative approach by: (i) explicitly incorporating population level trait variability; and (ii) quantifying the functional beta diversity in a series of 15 tropical forest plots arrayed along an elevational gradient. The results show a strong pattern of decay in community functional similarity with elevation. These observed patterns of functional beta diversity are shown to be highly non random and support a deterministic model of tropical tree community assembly and turnover.1811:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most climate change predictions omit species interactions and interspecific variation in dispersal. Here we develop a model of multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that includes temperature dependent competition differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so called no analogue communities defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches when mean community wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance the best dispersers tracked climate change out competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e. g. tropics) vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences. 1817:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species abundance distributions (SADs) are widely used as a tool for summarizing ecological communities but may have different shapes depending on the currency used to measure species importance. We develop a simple plotting method that links SADs in the alternative currencies of numerical abundance and biomass and is underpinned by testable predictions about how organisms occupy physical space. When log numerical abundance is plotted against log biomass the species lie within an approximately triangular region. Simple energetic and sampling constraints explain the triangular form. The dispersion of species within this triangle is the key to understanding why SADs of numerical abundance and biomass can differ. Given regular or random species dispersion we can predict the shape of the SAD for both currencies under a variety of sampling regimes. We argue that this dispersion pattern will lie between regular and random for the following reasons. First regular dispersion patterns will result if communities are comprised groups of organisms that use different components of the physical space (e. g. open water the sea bed surface or rock crevices in a marine fish assemblage) and if the abundance of species in each of these spatial guilds is linked to the way individuals of varying size use the habitat. Second temporal variation in abundance and sampling error will tend to randomize this regular pattern. Data from two intensively studied marine ecosystems offer empirical support for these predictions. Our approach also has application in environmental monitoring and the recognition of anthropogenic disturbance which may change the shape of the triangular region by for example the loss of large body size top predators that occur at low abundance. 1824:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The importance of neutral dynamics is contentiously debated in the ecological literature. This debate focuses onneutral theorys assumption offitness equivalency among individuals which conflicts with stabilizing fitness that promotes coexistence through niche differentiation. I take advantage of competition colonization trade offs between species of aquatic micro organisms ( protozoans and rotifers) to show that equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms can operate simultaneously. Competition trials between species with similar colonization abilities were less likely to result in competitive exclusion than for species further apart. While the stabilizing mechanism( colonization differences) facilitates coexistence at large spatial scales species with similar colonization abilities also exhibited local coexistence probably due to fitness similarities allowing weak stabilizing mechanisms to operate. These results suggest that neutral and niche based mechanisms of coexistence can simultaneously operate at differing temporal and spatial scales and such a spatially explicit view of coexistence may be one way to reconcile niche and neutral dynamics. 1859:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is with great pleasure that we publish this special issue of Resource and Energy Economics assembled by guest editor Prof. Geoffrey Heal of Columbia University.

This has been a multiyear process with drafts of all the papers presented at a workshop at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California in Santa Barbara in May 2001. The workshop provided a breadth of feedback that is reflected in the quality of the final papers published here. It should be noted that all papers have been refereed and final acceptance was conditional on the outcome of the refereeing process. 18:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1926:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, By integrating a wide range of experimental comparative and theoretical approaches ecologists are starting to gain a detailed understanding of the long term dynamics of vegetation. We explore how patterns of variation in demographic traits among species have provided insight into the processes that structure plant communities. We find a common set of mechanisms derived from ecological and evolutionary principles that underlie the main forces shaping systems as diverse as annual plant communities and tropical forests. Trait variation between species maintains diversity and has important implications for ecosystem processes. Hence greater understanding of how Earths vegetation functions wit likely require integration of ecosystem science with ideas from plant evolutionary population and community ecology. 1941:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Global scale changes in anthropogenic nutrient input into marine ecosystems via terrestrial runoff coupled with widespread predator removal via fishing have created greater urgency for understanding the relative role of top down versus bottom up control of food web dynamics. Yet recent large scale studies of community regulation in marine ecosystems have shown dramatically different results that leave this issue largely unresolved. We combined a multiyear large scale data set of species abundances for 46 species in kelp forests from the California Channel Islands with satellite derived primary production and found that top down control explains 7 to 10 fold more of the variance in abundance of bottom and mid trophic levels than does bottom up control. This top down control was propagated via a variety of species level direct and indirect responses to predator abundance. Management of top down influences such as fishing may be more important in coastal marine ecosystems particularly in kelp forest systems than is commonly thought. 1954:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most ecological hypotheses about species coexistence hinge on species differences but quantifying trait differences across species in diverse communities is often unfeasible. We examined the variation of demographic traits using a global tropical forest data set covering 4500 species in 10 large scale tree inventories. With a hierarchical Bayesian approach we quantified the distribution of mortality and growth rates of all tree species at each site. This allowed us to test the prediction that demographic differences facilitate species richness as suggested by the theory that a tradeoff between high growth and high survival allows species to coexist. Contrary to the prediction the most diverse forests had the least demographic variation. Although demographic differences may foster coexistence they do not explain any of the 16 fold variation in tree species richness observed across the tropics. 1958:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plant diversity and niche complementarity had progressively stronger effects on ecosystem functioning during a 7 year experiment with 16 species plots attaining 2.7 times greater biomass than monocultures. Diversity effects were neither transients nor explained solely by a few productive or unviable species. Rather many higher diversity plots outperformed the best monoculture. These results help resolve debate over biodiversity and ecosystem functioning show effects at higher than expected diversity levels and demonstrate for these ecosystems that even the best chosen monocultures cannot achieve greater productivity or carbon stores than higher diversity sites. 1966:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ecological consequences of biodiversity loss have aroused considerable interest and controversy during the past decade. Major advances have been made in describing the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem processes in identifying functionally important species and in revealing underlying mechanisms. There is however uncertainty as to how results obtained in recent experiments scale up to landscape and regional levels and generalize across ecosystem types and processes. Larger numbers of species are probably needed to reduce temporal variability in ecosystem processes in changing environments. A major future challenge is to determine how biodiversity dynamics ecosystem processes and abiotic factors interact. 1988:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper examines the tensions and paradoxes that arise during the life course of research groups as they strive to establish and maintain an identity acquire and retain control of an ensemble of research technologies and evaluate and choose the risks they are willing to accept in their work. My central aim is to rekindle interest in the ambivalences tensions and paradoxes of science by identifying and illustrating the tensions that characterize research groups. Among the questions of concern are: How does a group establish an independent identity while remaining connected with its field of research? How are consistency of focus and continuity of approach balanced against the freedom younger scientists need to develop as independent investigators? What varieties of risks are encountered in research and how are they evaluated and navigated? Based on intensive repeated face to face interviews with scientists at various levels of seniority at elite private and public universities the paper examines the choices leaders make at these critical junctures and the consequences of those choices. Several sorts of tensions are examined including autocracy versus democracy varieties of risk role conflicts openness versus secrecy competitive cooperation ambivalences about priority claims and balancing continuity and change and their implications for science scientists and the research process are discussed. 1990:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examine the ways in which the research process differs in developed and developing areas by focusing on two questions. First is collaboration associated with productivity? Second is access to the Internet (specifically use of email) associated with reduced problems of collaboration? Recent analyses by Lee and Bozeman (2005) and Walsh and Maloney (2003) suggest affirmative answers to these questions for US scientists. Based on a comparative analysis of scientists in Ghana Kenya and the State of Kerala in south western India (N 918) we find that: (1) collaboration is not associated with any general increment in productivity; and (2) while access to email does attenuate research problems such difficulties are structured more by national and regional context than by the collaborative process itself. The interpretation of these results suggests a paradox that raises issues for future studies: those conditions that unsettle the relationship between collaboration and productivity in developing areas may undermine the collaborative benefits of new information and communication technologies. 2002:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this communication we present a unifying framework to understand the emergence and maintenance of diversity in ecological systems. We do this by developing a deterministic population model including density dependent limitation in resources and available space. Our model shows that competitive exclusion and neutral coexistence represent different regimes of the same adaptive dynamics suggesting that neutrality is the general result of an adaptive process in a finite habitat with limited energetic resources. Our model explains the emergence of biodiversity through mutation and its maintenance through neutrality. We show that this framework provides the theoretical foundations to understand the emergence and maintenance of diversity in microbial ecosystems. 2006:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Neutral theory in ecology is aimed at describing communities where species coexist due to similarities rather than the classically posited niche differences. It assumes that all individuals regardless of species identity are demographically equivalent. However Hubbell suggested that neutral theory may describe even niche communities because tradeoffs equalize fitness across species which differ in their traits. In fact tradeoffs can involve stabilization as well as fitness equalization and stabilization involves different dynamics and can lead to different community patterns than neutral theory. Yet the important question remains if neutral theory provides a robust picture of all fitness equalized communities of which communities with demographic equivalence are one special case. Here I examine Hubbells suggestion for a purely fitness equalizing interspecific birth death tradeoff expanding neutral theory to a theory describing this broader class of fitness equalized communities. In particular I use a flexible framework allowing examination of the influence of speciation dynamics. I find that the scaling of speciation rates with birth and death rates which is poorly known has large impacts on community structure. In most cases the departure from the predictions of current neutral models is substantial. This work suggests that demographic and speciation complexities present a challenge to the future development and use of neutral theory in ecology as null model. The framework presented here will provide a starting point for meeting that challenge and may also be useful in the development of stochastic niche models with speciation dynamics. 2008:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Stochastic ecological network occupancy (SENO) models predict the probability that species will occur in a sample of an ecological network. In this review we introduce SENO models as a means to fill a gap in the theoretical toolkit of ecologists. As input SENO models use a topological interaction network and rates of colonization and extinction (including consumer effects) for each species. A SENO model then simulates the ecological network over time resulting in a series of sub networks that can be used to identify commonly encountered community modules. The proportion of time a species is present in a patch gives its expected probability of occurrence whose sum across species gives expected species richness. To illustrate their utility we provide simple examples of how SENO models can be used to investigate how topological complexity species interactions species traits and spatial scale affect communities in space and time. They can categorize species as biodiversity facilitators contributors or inhibitors making this approach promising for ecosystem based management of invasive threatened or exploited species. 2019:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A general theory of allometric scaling that predicts how the proportions of vascular plants and the characteristics of plant communities change or scale with plant size is outlined. The theory rests in part on the assumptions of (1) minimal energy dissipation in the transport of fluid through space filling fractal like branching vascular networks; and (2) the absence of scaling with plant size in the anatomical and physiological attributes of leaves and xylem. The theory shows how the scaling of metabolism with plant size is central to the scaling of whole plant form and function. It is shown how allometric constraints influence plant populations and potentially processes in plant evolution. Rapidly accumulating evidence in support of the general allometric model is reviewed and new evidence is presented. Current work supports the notion that scaling of how plants utilize space and resources is central to the development of a general synthetic and quantitative theory of plant form function ecology and diversity. 2051:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One of the greatest challenges for ecological restoration is to create or reassemble plant communities that are resistant to invasion by exotic species. We examine how concepts pertaining to the assembly of plant communities can be used to strengthen resistance to invasion in restored communities. Community ecology theory predicts that an invasive species will be unlikely to establish if there is a species with similar traits present in the resident community or if available niches are filled. Therefore successful restoration efforts should select native species with traits similar to likely invaders and include a diversity of functional traits. The success of trait based approaches to restoration will depend largely on the diversity of invaders on the strength of environmental factors and on dispersal dynamics of invasive and native species. 215:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,221:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,232:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,235:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,273:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mycorrhizae occur in nearly all terrestrial ecosystems. Resource exchange between host plants and mycorrhizal fungi influences community ecosystem and even global patterns and processes. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of mycorrhizal symbioses across a hierarchy of scales will help predict system responses to environmental change and facilitate the management of these responses for sustainability and productivity. Conceptual and mathematical models have been developed to help understand and predict mycorrhizal functions. These models are most developed for individual and population scale processes but models at community ecosystem and global scales are also beginning to emerge. We review seven types of mycorrhizal models that vary in their scale of resolution and dynamics and discuss approaches for integrating these models with each other and with general models of terrestrial ecosystems. 275:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,278:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Scientific synthesis has transformed ecological research and presents opportunities for advancements across the sciences; to date however little is known about the antecedents of success in synthesis. Building on findings from 10 years of detailed research on social interactions in synthesis groups at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis we demonstrated with large scale quantitative analyses that face to face interaction has been vital to success in synthesis groups boosting the production of peer reviewed publications. But it has been about more than just meeting; the importance of resident scientists at synthesis centers was also evident in that including synthesis center residents in geographically distributed working groups further increased productivity. Moreover multi institutional collaboration normally detrimental to productivity was positively associated with productivity in this stimulating environment. Finally participation in synthesis groups significantly increased scientists collaborative propensity and visibility positively affecting scientific careers and potentially increasing the capacity of the scientific community to leverage synthesis for enhanced scientific understanding. 284:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,285:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,287:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,298:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,29:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The relationship between ecosystem processes and species richness is all active area of research and speculation. Both theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted in numerous ecosystems. One finding of these studies is that the shape of the relationship between productivity and species richness varies considerably among ecosystems and at different spatial scales though little is known about the relative importance of physical and biological mechanisms causing this variation. Moreover despite widespread concern about changes in species global distributions it remains unclear if and how such large scale changes may affect this relationship. We present a new conceptual model of how invasive species might modulate relationships between primary production and species richness. We tested this model using long term data on relationships between aboveground net primary production and species richness in six North American terrestrial ecosystems. We show that primary production and abundance of non native species are both significant predictors of species richness though we fail to detect effects of invasion extent on the shapes of the relationship between species richness and primary production. 31:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, North American desert rodents have long been a model system for the study of community structure and dynamics. Field experiments and non manipulative observations have provided consistent evidence that interspecific competition influences spatial patterns and dynamic processes of community organization. Some of the evidence comes from assembly rules which document how the species that coexist in local communities differ in body size trophic morphology functional group or taxonomy more than would be expected had they been assembled by some random process. One assembly rule proposed by Fox is based on functional groups. It hypothesizes that species are assembled in such a way that each functional group tends to be filled before an additional species is added to an existing functional group. Communities that conform to the rule are termed favored states whereas other combinations are termed unfavored states. So if the rule is operating we should observe more favored states than expected by chance. Although Foxs assembly rule has been applied to a variety of systems its application to desert rodent communities has generated controversy. Fox and Brown showed that there were more favored states than expected by chance in two large data sets: a sample of 115 communities from the Nevada test site and another sample of 201 communities from sites widely distributed across the southwestern United States. Stone . criticized Fox and Brown claiming that the apparent conformity to the assembly rule was an artifact of the fact that the few widespread species are not treated realistically. They focused on the southwestern data set and argued that the nonrandom pattern of coexistence was due entirely to the sizes and overlaps of geographic ranges of different species. Kelt and Brown and Brown . showed that this was not true. They determined the regional species pool for each sample site composed of just those species whose geographic ranges overlapped the site and then assembled null communities by drawing the observed number of species at random from these geographically constrained pools. Their analysis showed that the communities obeyed Foxs assembly rule: the observed assemblages exhibited significantly more favored states than the random draws from the regional pools. Stone . apparently accepted this result because in this most recent critique they barely referred to the influence of geographic ranges on the patterns of coexistence in the southwestern data set. Instead Stone . shifted from the geographical to the regional scale. They focused on the Nevada data set where the restricted area insured that all of the 115 sample sites were within the geographic ranges of the same species. They also shifted their argument suggesting that the nonrandom patterns of local coexistence are an artifact of the fact that the assembly rule treated all species as equally likely to be found on all sites. They supported this claim by performing two analyses of the Nevada data set. 328:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,330:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,346:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,350:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Diversity in temperate forests is concentrated in the understory but understory dynamics are poorly understood for old growth forests. We use repeated measurements of more than eight hundred 1 m(2) plots over three decades to assess patterns of understory diversity in old growth mesic and wet forests in northern Michigan USA. We ask whether diversity changes systematically over time and whether dynamics are related to spatial scale. We find for all habitats significant understory diversity loss at square metre scales but not at coarser scales. Total herbaceous cover however remained constant or increased in total and for nearly all frequent species and no species were lost overall. We explore hypotheses about diversity regulation by exploring correlations with habitat canopy composition and properties of understory species. Nonindigenous plants are rare at the study site earthworm invasion is not apparent and deer browse is not intense. Diversity changes may be related to ecological guild membership. We suggest that the general loss of fine scale diversity is driven by either changing canopy composition or competitive dynamics within the understory community. Management for diversity maintenance in temperate forests must address understory communities; if herbaceous diversity is scale dependent and unstable over decadal time frames management approaches need to account for factors driving changes. 379:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,37:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A scientific field matures as its theoretical underpinnings consolidate around unified theories: conceptual structures consisting of a few general propositions that encompass a wide domain of phenomena and from which can be derived an array of models. We demonstrate this process with a synthetic theory of ecological gradients and species richness. Our unified theory rests on four propositions. First variation in some environmental factor effects variation in the number of individuals creating a gradient. Second in a uniform environment of fixed area more individuals lead to more species. Third the variance of an environmental factor increases with its mean for sites of equal area. Fourth all nonmonotonic relationships  hump shaped or U shaped) require a trade off in organismal performance or in population characteristics with respect to the environmental gradient. We identify 17 models that link environmental gradients with diversity show their relationship to our framework and describe issues surrounding their empirical testing. We illustrate how a general theory can be used to build new models such as that for the U shaped productivity diversity relationship. Finally we discuss how our theory could be unified further with other theories of diversity and indicate other areas of ecology that are ripe for unification. By providing an example of the process of theory unification we hope to encourage such efforts throughout ecology. 395:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,417:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,428:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,42:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,430:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,436:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,43:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although there is a large body of theory on spatial competitive coexistence very little of it involves comparative analyses of alternative mechanisms. We thus have limited knowledge of the conditions under which multiple spatial mechanisms can operate or of emergent properties arising from interactions between mechanisms. Here we present a mathematical framework that allows for comparative analysis of spatial coexistence mechanisms. The basis for comparison is mechanisms operating in spatially homogeneous competitive environments  life history trade offs) versus mechanisms operating in spatially heterogeneous competitive environments  source sink dynamics). Our comparative approach leads to several new insights about spatial coexistence. First we show that spatial variation in the expression of a life history trade off leads to a unique regional pattern that cannot be predicted by considering trade offs or source sink dynamics alone. This result represents an instance where spatial heterogeneity constrains rather than promotes coexistence and it illustrates the kind of counterintuitive emergent properties that arise due to interactions between different classes of mechanisms. Second we clarify the role of dispersal mortality in spatial coexistence. Previous studies have shown that coexistence can be constrained or facilitated by dispersal mortality. Our broader analysis distinguishes situations where dispersal mortality is not necessary for coexistence from those where such mortality is essential for coexistence because it preserves spatial variation in the strength of competition. These results form the basis for two important future directions: evolution of life history traits in spatially heterogeneous environments and elucidation of the cause and effect relationship(s) between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. 458:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,461:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,462:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,527:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,532:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In agroecosystems biodiversity correlates with ecosystem function yet mechanisms driving these relationships are often unknown. Examining traits and functional classifications of organisms providing ecosystem functions may provide insight into the mechanisms. Birds are important predators of insects including pests. However biological simplification of agroforests may decrease provisioning of this pest removal service by reducing bird taxonomic and functional diversity. A recent meta analysis of bird exclosure studies from a range of agroecosystems in Central America concluded that higher bird richness is associated with significantly greater arthropod removal yet the mechanism remains unclear. We conducted a meta analysis of the same data to examine whether birds demonstrate functional complementarity in tropical agroforests. We classified birds according to relevant traits (body mass foraging strategy foraging strata and diet) and then examined how design of functional classification including trait selection classification methods and the functional diversity metric used affect the suitability of different classifications as predictors of ecosystem services. We determined that vegetation characteristics are not likely drivers of arthropod removal by birds. For some functional classifications functional richness positively correlated with arthropod removal indicating that species complementarity may be an important mechanism behind this ecosystem function. The predictive ability of functional classifications increased with the number of traits included in the classification. For the two best classifications examined functional group richness was a better predictor of arthropod reduction than other metrics of functional diversity (FD and Raos Q). However no functional classification predicted arthropod removal better than simple species richness; thus other factors may be important. Our analysis indicates that the sampling effect may also play a role as one species and two functional groups were responsible for disproportionate effects of arthropod removal. 549:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Previous studies indicate substantial variation in ecological responses to perturbation. In some cases ecosystems are resilient to perturbation due to compensatory dynamics in which losses of sensitive species are offset by population increases of species that perform similar ecological functions. Here we report a detailed evaluation of compensatory dynamics in zooplankton community responses to the experimental acidification of Little Rock Lake Wisconsin USA. We used a variance ratio to quantify compensatory dynamics in functional groups of zooplankton containing Species that use similar resources and are vulnerable to the same predators. We also used first order autoregressive models to explore mechanisms driving the dynamics of each functional group Our results indicate that responses of functional groups to acidification can be highly variable. Herbivorous copepods and medium sized herbivorous cladocerans exhibited significant compensatory dynamics in response to acidification whereas other functional groups exhibited independent or synchronous dynamics. First order autoregressive models indicated that groups exhibiting compensatory dynamics contained both acid tolerant and acid sensitive species that competed. In contrast groups that contained only acid sensitive or acid tolerant species exhibited more independent or synchronous dynamics. Overall our study highlights the combined roles of sensitivity to environmental perturbation and species interactions in determining the extent of compensatory dynamics in zooplankton functional group responses to acidification. 550:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantifying patterns of temporal or spatial change in community structure is critical for assessing the impact of disturbances on biological systems and the stability of ecosystems. Detecting change in communities can be problematic however because of the inherent variability of systems and limitations of commonly used methods such as similarity indices and ordination that do not explicitly test a hypothesis. Here we present empirical data to show a strong relationship between species mean abundance and variability across three broad taxonomic groups (plants zooplankton and fish). These statistical relationships were then used to construct null models of expected community variability that were used to test against the observed temporal change of these communities We evaluated the ability of this approach to detect significant temporal change above that associated with random variation with nine communities (three Midwestern stream fish three north temperate zooplankton and three tallgrass prairie plant) each having long term data sets and different expected levels of change. Nonrandom change was detected in 21.3 PeRcEnT of samples from the expected low change communities 52.6 PeRcEnT in moderately changed communities and 60.4 PeRcEnT in high change communities. Thus this approach was effective in detecting change over time in those communities expected to change most. By using empirical relationships between species abundance and variability this null model approach provides ecologists and resource managers an objective tool which can be used along with existing community indices and statistical techniques to assess the type and magnitude of community change with limited data sets. 570:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,609:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Research on the various components of biodiversity has and will produce large quantities of heterogeneous and distributed data that need to be integrated and characterized in a unified way to reveal their full potential. Over the last thirty years the trait based functional approach to biodiversity has undergone an extraordinary expansion and has been key to advances in many fields of natural science. To represent exploit and share the tremendous amount of data the biodiversity community has to acquire data standards which should reflect the perception of this community. A first step toward this goal is to define the set of concepts that form the basis of this particular domain of knowledge thereby developing a thesaurus for plant functional diversity research. Such concepts can be represented by a controlled list of preferred terms that are identified by the thesaurus developers. Such a thesaurus will serve as a stable reference of standards for integration purposes specifically when published in RDF language a Semantic Web standard and in addition available as linked data on the web. Here we present Thesauform Traits a web based tool dedicated to the collaborative construction of a thesaurus by experts in the field of plant functional diversity research. Thesauform Traits fully exploits the key principle of the semantic web to facilitate both the thesaurus construction with SKOS and the interaction with Dublin Core and FOAF. It has been successfully used by a group of 15 experts to annotate and validate a set of definitions for more than 150 plant traits. ThesauFom Traits will be made available as an open source product and will allow scientific communities of all fields to develop thesauri for their specific domain. . 611:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,613:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,615:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,61:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological communities are spatially and temporally variable in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic forces. It is not always cleat however if spatial and temporal variability leads to instability in communities. Instability may result from strong biotic interactions or from stochastic processes acting on small populations. I used 10 15 yr of annual data from the Konza Prairie Long Term Ecological Research site to examine whether plant breeding bird grasshopper and small mammal communities in tallgrass prairie exhibit stability or directional change in response to different experimentally induced fire frequencies. Based on ordination and ANOVA plant and grasshopper communities on annually burned sites differed significantly from plant and grasshopper communities on less frequently burned sites. Breeding birds and small mammals differed among sites as well but these differences were not clearly related to disturbance frequency A modified time series analysis indicated that plant communities were undergoing directional change (unstable) on all watersheds regardless of fire frequency. Contrary to expectations directional change was greatest on the annually burned sites and lowest on the infrequently burned sites. Unlike the plant communities breeding bird. grasshopper and small mammal communities were temporally stable despite high compositional variability from 1 yr to the next. Stability among the consumer communities within these dynamic plant communities occurs because three dimensional vegetation structure does not change over time despite changes in plant species composition. Evidence suggests that instability in the plant community results from strong biotic interactions among temporally persistent core species and stochastic dynamics among infrequent satellite species. Overall community stability cannot be assessed if the pattern of temporal dynamics is unknown. Long term empirical studies of different taxa under different disturbance regimes are needed to determine over what time frames and spatial scales communities may be stable. Such studies are essential for the development of generalities regarding the relationship between disturbance frequency and community stability in terrestrial and aquatic systems. 639:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The fate of individual plants is strongly influenced by their spatial context  their location relative to competitors or environmental gradients). Recent theoretical developments indicate that spatial structure in plant communities arises as an outcome of environmental heterogeneity intra and interspecific competition and localized dispersal. Furthermore each of these forces is predicted to leave a signature on the spatial and temporal pattern within the community. We track the development of spatial structure in successional grasslands in southern California for five years using a series of large scale field experiments. We compare the observed changes in spatial structure to the predictions of a spatially explicit model of plant competition in heterogeneous landscapes. We conclude that environmental heterogeneity led to the development of aggregation in the first year at scales of 1 2 in. Over time aggregation was detectable at distances greater than 4 m and species become segregated as a result of competition and localized dispersal. Large scale disturbances (fire) homogenized the community by decreasing the level of aggregation and segregation. In contrast disturbance by pocket gophers and ground squirrels increased local scale heterogeneity by creating annual dominated aggregates. The speed with which spatial structure develops in seemingly homogeneous environments illustrates the importance of incorporating spatial context in empirical studies and models of plant community dynamics. 645:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,650:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Starting in 2002 with a paper entitled Global biodiversity biochemical kinetics and the energeticequivalence rule we have been developing a theoretical framework to understand the mechanisms underlying broadscale biodiversity gradients particularly the latitudinal gradient. This work is part of a broader Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) being developed to predict various aspects of the structure and function of ecological systems. Although MTE has been criticized support for its predictions continues to grow. In the preceding paper Hawkins . criticize the original work of Allen . based on their analyses of a large number of empirical data sets. Here we respond to their major criticisms and discuss important issues raised by their paper.  651:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We appreciate the opportunity to reply to Whittaker and Heegaards comment. Whittaker and Heegaard bring up a number of important points regarding the analysis of species richness productivity relationships (SRPRs). Some of their comments apply in broad fashion to any analysis of SRPRs whereas others are directed specifically at our published review. The relationship between productivity and species richness remains perhaps the most controversial of the diversity patterns and W&H have done much to help elucidate this relationship in their own research. We agree with many of W&Hs general comments particularly that there is no single universal SRPR and that patterns are scale dependent and we acknowledge their efforts to improve our understanding of SRPRs. However we disagree with W&H on a number of specific issues and we discuss these in our reply below. It is important to preface our reply by reiterating as W&H note that our study was the first attempt at a broadly inclusive literature review and meta analysis of SRPRs. Previous reviews of the SRPR were usually based on selected examples often used to support a particular point of view  the hump shaped SRPR). In our analysis we therefore broadly scoured the literature and applied standardized criteria to characterize the form of each SRPR. However as we note in our paper (and as W&H point out as well) the literature on SRPRs is heterogeneous and far from ideal. Any attempt at a meta analysis of SRPRs will involve decisions on how to treat the data and invariably compromise. W&H take issue with some of our analytical methods which they feel were too liberal towards detecting unimodal (hump shaped) patterns. We examine this issue below and then discuss their more general concerns about the impact of scale and surrogate measures of productivity on SRPRs. Because W&Hs comments focus on plants (trees in particular) we will limit our response to these groups as well although our original review included both animal and plant studies.  65:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is generally accepted that local species richness at a site reflects the combined influence of local and regional processes. However most empirical studies evaluate the influence of either local environmental variables or regional enrichment but not both simultaneously. Here we demonstrate the importance of combining these processes to understand continental scale richness patterns in breeding birds. We show that neither regional enrichment nor the local environment in isolation is sufficient to characterize observed patterns of species richness. Combining both sets of variables into a single model results in improved model fit and the removal of residual spatial autocorrelation. At short timescales local processes are most important for determining local richness but as the time scale of analysis increases regional enrichment becomes increasingly important. These results emphasize the need for increased integration of multiple scales of processes into models of species richness. 661:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although many indices estimate diversity species richness recently has been used as a surrogate for diversity in many studies in ecology biogeography and conservation. Underlying assumptions of this approach are that all diversity indices including those that weight species importance by their relative abundance  evenness) are correlated positively and that richness accounts for a large proportion of the variance in diversity. We addressed these assumptions with data from six grassland sites using univariate and multivariate analyses of a variety of indices (species evenness richness rarity dominance and Simpsons diversity index). Univariate correlations between plant species evenness and richness were weak and negative at each site. Principal component analyses consistently revealed two significant components of variation in diversity. Richness and evenness were largely orthogonal with Simpsons diversity loading between them. Thus measures of species diversity based on relative abundance as well as richness may be necessary to capture the full complexity of diversity in conservation studies and in experiments of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. At these and perhaps other sites species richness was an incomplete surrogate for diversity. 668:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An understanding of the relationship between species richness and productivity is crucial to understanding biodiversity in lakes. We investigated the relationship between the primary productivity of lake ecosystems and the number of species for lacustrine phytoplankton rotifers cladocerans copepods macrophytes and fish. Our study includes two parts: (1) a survey of 33 well studied lakes for which data on six major taxonomic groups were available; and (2) a comparison of the effects of short and long term whole lake nutrient addition on primary productivity and planktonic species richness. In the survey species richness of all six taxa showed a significant quadratic response to increased annual primary productivity (C 14 estimate g C.m( 2).yr( 1)) when lake area is taken into account. However the richness productivity relationship for phytoplankton and fish was strongly dependent on lake area. The relationship for phytoplankton rotifers cladocerans copepods and macrophytes was significantly unimodal. Species richness generally peaked at levels of primary productivity in the range of 30 300 g C.m( 2).yr( 1). For the average lake size the highest biodiversity tended to occur in lakes with relatively low primary productivity such as those found in the Northern Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the upper Midwest (United States) and in the Experimental Lakes Area of Ontario (Canada). Based on short term (3 yr) and long term (21 24 yr) experiments we tested whether individual lakes respond to whole lake enrichment experiments in the manner suggested by analyses of survey data. Experimental addition of nutrients produced varied and unpredictable responses in species richness probably due to transient dynamics and time lags. Responses to nutrient addition were taxon and lake specific. Phytoplankton showed a variety of relationships between species richness and pelagic primary productivity (PPR) depending on the history of enrichment and recovery. No significant effect of primary productivity on rotifer richness occurred in any of the experimental lakes whereas richness of crustacean zooplankton was negatively correlated with primary productivity in both the short and long term experiments. 670:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,675:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Compensatory population dynamics in which species that decline in response to an environmental perturbation are replaced by similar species may be crucial in maintaining processes performed by functional groups of species. Compensatory dynamics may be produced by negative interactions among species such that the decrease in abundance of a species releases the suppression of another species and allows it to increase. We conducted a mesocosm experiment in Trout Lake Wisconsin USA to test the hypothesis that compensatory shifts in species abundances play a role in overall planktonic community response to pH perturbation. In 2000 L mesocosms over a period of six weeks we contrasted a control treatment with two acidified treatments (press sustained pH equals 4.7; and pulse alternating pH equals 4.7 and ambient pH). In the acidified treatments we saw changes in abundance of the major zooplankton and phytoplankton species but we observed few cases of compensatory dynamics. Nonetheless when present compensatory dynamics could be strong. Analyses using autoregressive models revealed negative interactions among species that could potentially lead to compensatory dynamics. However this potential for compensatory dynamics was not realized in cases where all species were sensitive to the pH perturbations. Therefore compensatory dynamics that buffer community responses to perturbations may be limited in communities in which many species are sensitive to the perturbation. 690:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem stability in variable environments depends on the diversity of form and function of the constituent species. Species phenotypes and ecologies are the product of evolution and the evolutionary history represented by co occurring species has been shown to be an important predictor of ecosystem function. If phylogenetic distance is a surrogate for ecological differences then greater evolutionary diversity should buffer ecosystems against environmental variation and result in greater ecosystem stability. We calculated both abundance weighted and unweighted phylogenetic measures of plant community diversity for a long term biodiversity ecosystem function experiment at Cedar Creek Minnesota USA. We calculated a detrended measure of stability in aboveground biomass production in experimental plots and showed that phylogenetic relatedness explained variation in stability. Our results indicate that communities where species are evenly and distantly related to one another are more stable compared to communities where phylogenetic relationships are more clumped. This result could be explained by a phylogenetic sampling effect where some lineages show greater stability in productivity compared to other lineages and greater evolutionary distances reduce the chance of sampling only unstable groups. However we failed to find evidence for similar stabilities among closely related species. Alternatively we found evidence that plot biomass variance declined with increasing phylogenetic distances and greater evolutionary distances may represent species that are ecologically different (phylogenetic complementarity). Accounting for evolutionary relationships can reveal how diversity in form and function may affect stability. 693:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Empirical studies show that the relationship between species diversity and productivity can be strongly scale dependent. At the local scale of population dynamics the relationship is commonly unimodal or humped but it is frequently monotonically increasing at larger spatial scales. Such contrasting patterns can occur if beta diversity (compositional dissimilarity among sites) also increases with productivity but mechanistic reasons for this remain unresolved. Here we use theoretical models to explore the influence of ecological assembly on the diversity of multitrophic communities along gradients of productivity. We show that assembly dynamics can generate scale dependent. patterns consistent with those observed in nature; while unimodal productivity diversity patterns are produced at the scale of local communities positive monotonic patterns emerge when diversity is measured at larger spatial scales (among communities). This occurs due to increases in beta diversity with productivity. Our results suggest that increases in beta diversity and resultant scale dependency can depend on three vital and interactive elements: the presence of more than one consumer trophic level a greater propensity for cyclic compositional change at high productivities and the stochastic nature of species dispersal and invasion history. 695:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Experimental studies demonstrating that nitrogen (N) enrichment reduces plant diversity within individual plots have led to the conclusion that anthropogenic N enrichment is a threat to global biodiversity. These conclusions overlook the influence of spatial scale however as N enrichment may alter beta diversity  how similar plots are in their species composition) which would likely alter the degree to which N induced changes in diversity within localities translate to changes in diversity at larger scales that are relevant to policy and management. Currently it is unclear how N enrichment affects biodiversity at scales larger than a small plot. We synthesized data from 18 N enrichment experiments across North America to examine the effects of N enrichment on plant species diversity at three spatial scales: small (within plots) intermediate (among plots) and large (within and among plots). We found that N enrichment reduced plant diversity within plots by an average of 25 PeRcEnT (ranging from a reduction of 61 PeRcEnT to an increase of 5 PeRcEnT) and frequently enhanced beta diversity. The extent to which N enrichment altered b diversity however varied substantially among sites ( from a 22 PeRcEnT increase to an 18 PeRcEnT reduction) and was contingent on site productivity. Specifically N enrichment enhanced beta diversity at low productivity sites but reduced beta diversity at high productivity sites. N induced changes in beta diversity generally reduced the extent of species loss at larger scales to an average of 22 PeRcEnT (ranging from a reduction of 54 PeRcEnT to an increase of 18 PeRcEnT). Our results demonstrate that N enrichment often reduces biodiversity at both local and regional scales but that a focus on the effects of N enrichment on biodiversity at small spatial scales may often overestimate (and sometimes underestimate) declines in regional biodiversity by failing to recognize the effects of N on beta diversity. 699:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fire is a major force driving the evolution of plants and the structure and function of ecosystems globally. It thus likely operates as an important environmental filter that selects for species that have evolved to tolerate and depend on fire. Across a 40 year experimental fire gradient from frequently burned open savanna to unburned dense woodland in Minnesota USA we examined the relationships among community assembly evolutionary history and functional trait composition. Close relatives had similar abundance patterns across the fire gradient providing evidence for phylogenetic conservatism in fire adaptation and highlighting the importance of shared ancestry in predicting species responses to fire. Phylogenetic beta diversity was greatest between the most extreme fire treatments across the gradient indicating that species in the most contrasting fire regimes were most distantly related. Fire strongly influenced diversity co occurrence patterns and leaf trait means and variances within communities. The most frequently burned communities had the highest species richness exhibited the most resource conservative leaf traits and spanned the greatest number of phylogenetic lineages but harbored more close relatives within those lineages than other communities. In contrast unburned communities had the lowest species diversity the most acquisitive leaf traits and the fewest phylogenetic lineages but close relatives co occurred less frequently. The largest difference in abundance between treatments occurred within the Rosales Asteraceae Vitaceae and the Poaceae; woody Rosales were strongly selected for in unburned communities while composites and grasses of the Poaceae were strongly selected for under frequent burning. A major climatic perturbation of consecutive hot dry summers in the late 1980s prompted a significant shift in the functional and phylogenetic composition of communities. Greater than expected turnover in species composition occurred following the drought years and then again during the subsequent five year rebound period. Just after the drought year turnover was greatest among recently diverged taxa whereas during the rebound period turnover was greater among taxa that diverged deep in the phylogeny. The drought years also caused a short term shift in functional traits including declines in specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content and an increase in leaf length. These results indicate that the phylogenetic and functional trait composition of communities are responsive both to fire gradients and to shocks to the system such as climatic perturbation. 740:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predictable relationships among patterns processes and properties of plant communities are crucial for developing meaningful conceptual models in community ecology. We studied such relationships in 18 plant communities spread throughout nine Northern Hemisphere high mountain subalpine and alpine meadow systems and found linear and curvilinear correlative links among temperature precipitation productivity plant interactions spatial pattern and richness. We found that sites with comparatively mild climates have greater plant biomass and at these sites strong competition corresponds with overdispersed distribution of plants reducing intraspecific patchiness and in turn increasing local richness. Sites with cold climates have little biomass and at these sites a high proportion of species benefit from strong facilitative effects of neighbors leading to an aggregated distribution of plants. Sites with intermediate or relatively moderate climates are intermediate in biomass and at these sites interactions are weak (or competition may be counterbalanced by facilitation) corresponding with a nearly random distribution of plants. At these sites species richness is lower than average. We propose that the relationship between interspecific spatial pattern and community richness reflects niche differentiation and or construction which allows for the coexistence of more species than would be possible with random unstructured spatial distributions. Discovering the mechanisms that drive the relationships described here would further link functional and structural components of plant communities and enhance the predictive capability of community ecology. 742:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantitative synthesis across studies requires consistent measures of effect size among studies. In community ecology these measures of effect size will often be some measure of the strength of interactions between taxa. However indices of interaction strength vary greatly among both theoretical and empirical studies and the connection between hypotheses about interaction strength and the metrics that are used to test these hypotheses are often not explicit. We describe criteria for choosing appropriate metrics and methods for comparing them among studies at three stages of designing a meta analysis to test hypotheses about variation in interaction intensity: (1) the choice of response variable; (2) how effect size is calculated using the response in two treatments; and (3) whether there is a consistent quantitative effect across all taxa and systems studied or only qualitatively similar effects within each taxon system combination. The consequences of different choices at each of these stages are illustrated with a meta analysis to examine the relationship between competition facilitation intensity and productivity in plants. The analysis used a database of 296 cases in 14 studies. The results were unexpected and largely inconsistent with existing theory: competition intensity often significantly declined (rather than increased) with productivity and facilitation was sometimes restricted to more productive (rather than less productive) sites. However there was considerable variation in the pattern among response variables and measures of effect size. For example on average competitive effects on final biomass and survival decreased with standing crop but competitive effects on growth rate did not. On the other hand facilitative interactions were more common at low standing crop for final biomass and growth rate but more common at high standing crop for survival. Results were more likely to be significant using the log response ratio (In removal control ) as the effect size than using the relative competition intensity ( removal control removal) although the trends for these conceptually similar indices did not differ. When all studies were grouped in a single meta regression of interaction intensity on standing crop to test quantitative similarity among studies survival showed the dearest negative relationship. However when the same regressions were done for each unique combination of taxon and site within each study to test for qualitative similarity among studies the slopes averaged over studies tended to be negative for biomass and growth rate but not different from zero for survival. These results are subject to a number of caveats because of the limitations of the available data most notably the extension of effects of interactions on individual growth or survival to effects on population distribution and abundance or community structure is highly problematic. Nevertheless the fact that none of the meta analyses demonstrated a significant positive relationship between competition and standing crop but that we frequently found negative relationships is an important pattern that has not been apparent from qualitative surveys of individual studies and it demonstrates the potential power of meta analysis in ecology. We conclude with recommendations to overcome some of the limitations of the currently available data and meta analytical procedures. 743:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent research in aquatic systems suggests that productivity richness relationships change with spatial scale and that species turnover  spatial and temporal variation in species composition) plays an important role in generating this scale dependence. The generality of such scale dependence and the effects of variation in temporal scale remain unknown. We examined the extent to which the richness productivity relationship in terrestrial plant communities depends on spatial or temporal scale and evaluated how spatial and temporal turnover  species turnover in space and time) generates scale dependence in these relationships using data from two Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites (Jornada and Konza). We found a weak hump shaped relationship (Jornada) and no relationship (Konza) between richness and productivity at the smallest focal scale (I m(2) at Jornada and 50 m(2) at Konza) at each site but strong hump shaped relationships at the largest focal scale (49 m(2) at Jornada and 200 m(2) at Konza) for each site. Relationships between spatial turnover and productivity at each site mirrored the productivity richness relationships that emerged at the larger spatial scale  a significant hump shaped pattern). In contrast temporal turnover was unrelated to productivity and hence increasing temporal scale did not appreciably change the form of the productivity richness relationship. Our study suggests that the way in which productivity richness relationships change with spatial or temporal scale depends on the form and strength of the underlying relationship between species turnover and productivity. Moreover we contend that a dominant effect of increasing productivity is the generation of dissimilarity in species composition among localities that comprise a region rather than increasing the number of species that occur within local communities. Thus understanding the mechanisms that cause species turnover to vary with productivity is critical to understanding scale dependence in richness productivity relationships. 752:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Summarizing complex temporal dynamics in communities is difficult to achieve in a way that yields an intuitive picture of change. Rank clocks and rank abundance statistics provide a graphical and analytical framework for displaying and quantifying community dynamics. We used rank clocks in which the rank order abundance for each species is plotted over time in temporal clockwise direction to display temporal changes in species abundances and richness. We used mean rank shift and proportional species persistence to quantify changes in community structure in long term data sets from fertilized and control plots in a late successional old field frequently and infrequently burned tallgrass prairie and Chihuahuan desert grassland and shrubland communities. Rank clocks showed that relatively constant species richness masks considerable temporal dynamics in relative species abundances. In the old field fertilized plots initially experienced high mean rank shifts that stabilized rapidly below that of unfertilized plots. Rank shifts were higher in infrequently burned vs. annually burned tallgrass prairie and in desert grassland compared to shrubland vegetation. Proportional persistence showed that and grasslands were more dynamic than mesic grasslands. We conclude that rank clocks and rank abundance statistics provide important insights into community dynamics that are often hidden by traditional univariate approaches. 765:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The relative importance of regional and local processes in determining community structure is a long standing problem in community ecology. This is especially problematic in communities from highly connected habitats which undergo two opposing forces: differences in environmental conditions of the habitats lead to divergence of the communities while the dispersal of individuals leads to convergence of the communities. Using a transplant experiment we experimentally showed that biotic interactions have a predictable deterministic impact on zooplankton community structure in a metacommunity of highly interconnected shallow ponds. Fish predation and presence of abundant macrophyte cover. rapidly structured regional communities of zooplankton both in terms of relative abundances and of cladoceran species richness. Moreover we could use the relations between the experimentally manipulated environmental conditions and the observed experimental communities to successfully classify the contrasting local communities found in the original neighboring ponds thus directly relating the experimental results to the actual field situation. Notwithstanding the observed strong impact of local biotic conditions we also showed that dispersal had an influence on community structure and species richness. Dispersal increased species richness of cladocerans by three species and influenced zooplankton community structure. More over dispersal actually made the response to local conditions more deterministic. 766:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The response of a species to an environmental perturbation depends on both the direct effect of the perturbation on the population growth rate of the species and the indirect effects operating through interactions among species in a community. To estimate the importance of indirect effects we analyzed the population dynamics of nine zooplankton species or species groups in a lake subjected to experimental manipulations of the fish community. The manipulations included additions and removals of planktivorous and piscivorous fish over a period of seven years thereby producing changes in planktivory rates on the zooplankton community. Applying autoregressive models to time series data collected during weekly samples we estimated the direct interaction strengths between species thereby constructing a quantitative interaction web for the zooplankton community. We then used this interaction web to explore the roles of direct and indirect interactions between species in determining the long term changes in zooplankton biomasses that were observed over the course of the experimental manipulations. The analysis identified Daphnia pulex as a keystone species. This large herbivore had strong direct interactions with other zooplankton species and was strongly affected by changes in planktivory. Consequently changes in the biomasses of other zooplankton species during the planktivory manipulations were influenced strongly by indirect interactions acting through changes in D. pulex biomass. In addition we used the analysis to ask whether information about the response of species to planktivory manipulations could be used to anticipate species responses to other types of perturbation. If the direct effects of a novel perturbation on each species in a community were known then the interaction web would help to anticipate how a novel perturbation will affect each species via direct and indirect effects through the community. 770:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The study of biodiversity has tended to focus primarily on relatively information poor measures of species diversity. Recently many studies of local diversity (alpha diversity) have begun to use measures of functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity. Investigations into the phylogenetic and functional dissimilarity (beta diversity) of communities have been far less numerous but these dissimilarity measures have the potential to infer the mechanisms underlying community assembly and dynamics. Here we relate levels of phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity to levels of phylogenetic and functional beta diversity to infer the mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the assembly of tree communities in six forests located in tropical and temperate latitudes. The results show that abiotic filtering plays a role in structuring local assemblages and governing spatial turnover in community composition and that phylogenetic measures of alpha and beta diversity are not strong predictors of functional alpha and beta diversity in the forests studied. 773:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ubiquity of the latitudinal gradient of species richness is well documented at coarse scales of resolution but the extent to which the pattern is recapitulated at the level of local communities for any aspect of biodiversity  richness evenness or diversity) is unclear We examined how attributes of New World bat diversity vary with each other and with latitude at two scales of resolution: local communities and regional species pools. We calculated 14 indices of diversity (species richness three evenness four dominance three and diversity four ) from species abundance distributions for 32 intensively sampled local sites between 42.25 degrees N and 24.12 degrees S latitude. The species richness of each corresponding regional pool was estimated from published range maps. In general the gradient of local species richness was less steep than the corresponding gradient of regional species richness; beta diversity in the tropics is greater than that for temperate communities. All aspects of diversity at the local scale did not vary with latitude in the same manner. The latitudinal gradient in species diversity of local communities was primarily a consequence of the corresponding gradient in species richness. Local richness increased and became more variable with decreasing latitude. In contrast species evenness did not vary in a systematic fashion with latitude. Although the absolute number of rare species in communities increased faster with latitude than did that of common species both abundance classes proportionately increased with latitude in equivalent ways throughout the New World. In general latitudinal variation at the community level was detected in diversity indices that were insensitive to the abundance of species. The dramatic increase in species richness at broad scales of resolution toward the tropics (gamma diversity) was as much a consequence of increased richness at the local level (alpha diversity) as it was a consequence of the latitudinal increase in species turnover among communities (beta diversity). Future theoretical research should examine the correlates of latitude that enhance differentiation among communities at low latitudes  those which enjoy high productivities). Conservation strategies based on assessments of diversity at coarse levels of resolution (gamma diversity) should be implemented with caution because beta diversity inflates regional estimates of diversity. 779:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To predict the ecological consequences of biodiversity loss researchers have spent much time and effort quantifying how biological variation affects the magnitude and stability of ecological processes that underlie the functioning of ecosystems. Here we add to this work by looking at how biodiversity jointly impacts two aspects of ecosystem functioning at once: (1) the production of biomass at any single point in time (biomass area or biomass volume) and (2) the stability of biomass production through time (the CV of changes in total community biomass through time). While it is often assumed that biodiversity simultaneously enhances both of these aspects of ecosystem functioning the joint distribution of data describing how species richness regulates productivity and stability has yet to be quantified. Furthermore analyses have yet to examine how diversity effects on production covary with diversity effects on stability. To overcome these two gaps we reanalyzed the data from 34 experiments that have manipulated the richness of terrestrial plants or aquatic algae and measured how this aspect of biodiversity affects community biomass at multiple time points. Our reanalysis confirms that biodiversity does indeed simultaneously enhance both the production and stability of biomass in experimental systems and this is broadly true for terrestrial and aquatic primary producers. However the strength of diversity effects on biomass production is independent of diversity effects on temporal stability. The independence of effect sizes leads to two important conclusions. First while it may be generally true that biodiversity enhances both productivity and stability it is also true that the highest levels of productivity in a diverse community are not associated with the highest levels of stability. Thus on average diversity does not maximize the various aspects of ecosystem functioning we might wish to achieve in conservation and management. Second knowing how biodiversity affects productivity gives no information about how diversity affects stability (or vice versa). Therefore to predict the ecological changes that occur in ecosystems after extinction we will need to develop separate mechanistic models for each independent aspect of ecosystem functioning. 785:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the relationship between species richness and productivity is fundamental to the management and preservation of biodiversity. Yet despite years of study and intense theoretical interest this relationship remains controversial. Here we present the results of a literature survey in which we examined the relationship between species richness and productivity in 171 published studies. We extracted the raw data from published tables and graphs and subjected these data to a standardized analysis using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and generalized linear model (GLIM) regression to test for significant positive negative or curvilinear relationships between productivity and species diversity. If the relationship was curvilinear we tested whether the maximum (or minimum) of the curve occurred within the range of productivity values observed  was there evidence of a hump?). A meta analysis conducted on the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients showed that the average quadratic coefficient was negative  the average species richness productivity relationship was curvilinear and decelerating) and that the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients was significantly heterogeneous. the studies did not sample the same underlying species richness productivity relationship). Looking more closely at the patterns of productivity diversity relationships we found that for vascular plants at geographical scales smaller than continents hump shaped relationships occurred most frequently (41 45 PeRcEnT of all studies). A positive relationship between productivity and species richness was the next most common pattern and positive and hump shaped relationships co dominated at the continental scale. For animals positive negative and hump shaped patterns were common at most geographical scales and no one pattern predominated. For both plants and animals hump shaped curves were relatively more common in studies that crossed community boundaries compared to studies conducted within a community type and plant studies that crossed community types tended to span a greater range of productivity compared to studies Within community types. Sample size and plot size did not affect the probability of finding a particular productivity diversity relationship  positive hump shaped etc.). However hump shaped curves were especially common (65 PeRcEnT) in studies of plant diversity that used plant biomass as a measure of productivity and in studies conducted in aquatic systems. 799:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, While communities are shaped by both local interactions and enrichment from the regional species pool we propose a hypothesis that the balance of these forces shifts with latitude with regional enrichment dominating at high latitudes and local interactions dominating at low latitudes. To test this hypothesis we conducted a latitudinal scale experiment with marine epifaunal communities. In four regions of the North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea we used mimics of ecosystem engineers to manipulate biogenic structural complexity. We iteratively evaluated diversity patterns of experimental communities up to one year after deployment. Additional data were also collected from one of our tropical sites 2.5 years after initial deployment. As hypothesized we found a reciprocal latitudinal gradient in the effects of the structurally complex mimics and regional enrichment. In the tropics local diversity was always higher in association with the mimics than in exposed areas that were more open to predation. This effect was consistent across two spatial scales and beyond the one year timescale of the experiment. In temperate communities no consistent effects of the mimics on diversity were observed. However the proportion of species from the regional species pool that were present at the local scale increased from the tropics to the temperate zone consistent with the hypothesis that higher latitude communities may experience greater influence from the regional species pool than communities at low latitudes. This study represents the first large scale experimental demonstration that suggests that the relative impact of local interactions and regional enrichment on community diversity may depend on latitude. 79:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,80:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,812:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A humped back relationship between species richness and community biomass has frequently been observed in plant communities at both local and regional scales although often improperly called a productivity diversity relationship. Explanations for this relationship have emphasized the role of competitive exclusion probably because at the time when the relationship was first examined competition was considered to be the significant biotic filter structuring plant communities. However over the last 15 years there has been a renewed interest in facilitation and this research has shown a clear link between the role of facilitation in structuring communities and both community biomass and the severity of the environment. Although facilitation may enlarge the realized niche of species and increase community richness in stressful environments there has only been one previous attempt to revisit the humped back model of species richness and to include facilitative processes. However to date no model has explored whether biotic interactions can potentially shape both sides of the humped back model for species richness commonly detected in plant communities. Here we propose a revision of Grimes original model that incorporates a new understanding of the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities. In this revised model facilitation promotes diversity at medium to high environmental severity levels by expanding the realized niche of stress intolerant competitive species into harsh physical conditions. However when environmental conditions become extremely severe the positive effects of the benefactors wane (as supported by recent research on facilitative interactions in extremely severe environments) and diversity is reduced. Conversely with decreasing stress along the biomass gradient facilitation decreases because stress intolerant species become able to exist away from the canopy of the stress tolerant species (as proposed by facilitation theory). At the same time competition increases for stress tolerant species reducing diversity in the most benign conditions (as proposed by models of competition theory). In this way our inclusion of facilitation into the classic model of plant species diversity and community biomass generates a more powerful and richer predictive framework for understanding the role of plant interactions in changing diversity. We then use our revised model to explain both the observed discrepancies between natural patterns of species richness and community biomass and the results of experimental studies of the impact of biodiversity on the productivity of herbaceous communities. It is clear that explicit consideration of concurrent changes in stress tolerant and competitive species enhances our capacity to explain and interpret patterns in plant community diversity with respect to environmental severity. 814:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A new analysis of the nearly century old Lotka Volterra theory allows us to link species interactions to biodiversity patterns including: species abundance distributions estimates of total community size patterns of community invasibility and predicted responses to disturbance. Based on a few restrictive assumptions about species interactions our calculations require only that the community is sufficiently large to allow a mean field approximation. We develop this analysis to show how an initial assemblage of species with varying interaction strengths is predicted to sort out into the final community based on the species predicted target densities. The sorting process yields predictions of covarying patterns of species abundance community size and species interaction strengths. These predictions can be tested using enrichment experiments examination of latitudinal and productivity gradients and features of community assembly. 820:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biodiversity is declining from unprecedented land conversions that replace diverse low intensity agriculture with vast expanses under homogeneous intensive production. Despite documented losses of species richness consequences for beta diversity changes in community composition between sites are largely unknown especially in the tropics. Using a 10 year data set on Costa Rican birds we find that low intensity agriculture sustained beta diversity across large scales on a par with forest. In high intensity agriculture low local (a) diversity inflated beta diversity as a statistical artefact. Therefore at small spatial scales intensive agriculture appeared to retain beta diversity. Unlike in forest or low intensity systems however high intensity agriculture also homogenised vegetation structure over large distances thereby decoupling the fundamental ecological pattern of bird communities changing with geographical distance. This similar to 40 PeRcEnT decline in species turnover indicates a significant decline in beta diversity at large spatial scales. These findings point the way towards multi functional agricultural systems that maintain agricultural productivity while simultaneously conserving biodiversity. 832:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecologists now recognize that controversy over the relative importance of niches and neutrality cannot be resolved by analyzing species abundance patterns. Here we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence. 83:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Previous studies have suggested that species responded individualistically to the climate change of the last glaciation expanding and contracting their ranges independently. Consequently many researchers have concluded that community composition is plastic over time. Here I quantitatively assess changes in community composition over broad timescales and assess the effect of range shifts on community composition. Data on Pleistocene mammal assemblages from the FAUNMAP database were divided into four time periods (preglacial full glacial postglacial and modern). Simulation analyses were designed to determine whether the degree of change in community composition is consistent with independent range shifts given the distribution of range shifts observed. Results indicate that many of the communities examined in the United States were more similar through time than expected if individual range shifts were completely independent. However in each time transition examined there were areas of nonanalogue communities. I conducted sensitivity analyses to explore how the results were affected by the assumptions of the null model. Conclusions about changes in mammalian distributions and community composition are robust with respect to the assumptions of the model. Thus whether because of biotic interactions or because of common environmental requirements community structure through time is more complex than previously thought. 840:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Global energy use and food production have increased nitrogen inputs to ecosystems worldwide impacting plant community diversity composition and function. Previous studies show considerable variation across terrestrial herbaceous ecosystems in the magnitude of species loss following nitrogen (N) enrichment. What controls this variation remains unknown. We present results from 23 N addition experiments across North America representing a range of climatic soil and plant community properties to determine conditions that lead to greater diversity decline. Species loss in these communities ranged from 0 to 65 PeRcEnT of control richness. Using hierarchical structural equation modelling we found greater species loss in communities with a lower soil cation exchange capacity colder regional temperature and larger production increase following N addition independent of initial species richness plant productivity and the relative abundance of most plant functional groups. Our results indicate sensitivity to N addition is co determined by environmental conditions and production responsiveness which overwhelm the effects of initial community structure and composition. 844:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Land use intensification can greatly reduce species richness and ecosystem functioning. However species richness determines ecosystem functioning through the diversity and values of traits of species present. Here we analyze changes in species richness and functional diversity (FD) at varying agricultural land use intensity levels. We test hypotheses of FD responses to land use intensification in plant bird and mammal communities using trait data compiled for 1600 species. To isolate changes in FD from changes in species richness we compare the FD of communities to the null expectations of FD values. In over one quarter of the bird and mammal communities impacted by agriculture declines in FD were steeper than predicted by species number. In plant communities changes in FD were indistinguishable from changes in species richness. Land use intensification can reduce the functional diversity of animal communities beyond changes in species richness alone potentially imperiling provisioning of ecosystem services. 845:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Long term conservation of biodiversity may depend not only on the maintenance of its component parts but also on their interactions. Here we provide strong evidence that an introduced species is able to affect the network of interactions among coexisting species. We studied plant pollinator interactions in native forest sites with and without domestic cattle and used these data to construct plant pollinator interaction networks. Results from nonmetric multidimensional scaling and permutation tests suggest that the presence of cattle has significantly modified the structure of the plant pollinator interaction network. The effect of cattle on network structure was mainly because of the modification of a few highly frequent interactions which are likely important from a functional perspective. This overwhelming influence of a few interactions on observed community patterns should serve as a caution to those studying community and ecosystem properties. 856:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One of the oldest and richest questions in biology is that of how species diversity is related to the availability of resources that limit the productivity of ecosystems. Researchers from a variety of disciplines have pursued this question from at least three different theoretical perspectives. Species energy theory has argued that the summed quantities of all resources influence species richness by controlling population sizes and the probability of stochastic extinction. Resource ratio theory has argued that the imbalance in the supply of two or more resources relative to the stoichiometric needs of the competitors can dictate the strength of competition and in turn the diversity of coexisting species. In contrast to these the field of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning has argued that species diversity acts as an independent variable that controls how efficiently limited resources are utilized and converted into new tissue. Here we propose that all three of these fields give necessary but not sufficient conditions to explain productivity diversity relationships (PDR) in nature. However when taken collectively these three paradigms suggest that PDR can be explained by interactions among four distinct non interchangeable variables: (i) the overall quantity of limiting resources (ii) the stoichiometric ratios of different limiting resources (iii) the summed biomass produced by a group of potential competitors and (iv) the richness of co occurring species in a local competitive community. We detail a new multivariate hypothesis that outlines one way in which these four variables are directly and indirectly related to one another. We show how the predictions of this model can be fit to patterns of covariation relating the richness and biomass of lake phytoplankton to three biologically essential resources (N P and light) in a large number of Norwegian lakes. 857:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Over the last two decades although much has been learned regarding the multifaceted nature of biodiversity relatively little is known regarding spatial variation in constituents other than species richness. This is particularly true along extensive environmental gradients such as latitude. Herein we describe latitudinal gradients in the functional diversity of New World bat communities. Bat species from each of 32 communities were assigned to one of seven functional groups. Latitudinal gradients existed for the richness diversity and scaled dominance of functional groups. No significant patterns were observed for evenness of functional groups. Measures of functional diversity were different in magnitude and increased towards the equator at a faster rate than expected given the underlying spatial variation in species richness. Thus latitudinal gradient in species richness alone do not cause the latitudinal gradient in functional diversity. When variation in species composition of the regional fauna of each community was incorporated into analyses many differences between observed and simulated patterns of functional diversity were not significant. This suggests that those processes that determine the composition of regional faunas strongly influence the latitudinal gradient in functional diversity at the local level. Nonetheless functional diversity was lower than expected across observed sites. Community wide responses to variation in the quantity and quality of resources at the local level probably contribute to differences in functional diversity at local and regional scales and enhance beta diversity. 858:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P A recent increase in studies of beta diversity has yielded a confusing array of concepts measures and methods. Here we provide a roadmap of the most widely used and ecologically relevant approaches for analysis through a series of mission statements. We distinguish two types of beta diversity: directional turnover along a gradient vs. non directional variation. Different measures emphasize different properties of ecological data. Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in beta diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions matched by appropriate analyses. The rigorous application of null models will also help to reveal potential processes driving observed patterns in beta diversity. 863:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P Mycorrhizal fungi influence plant growth local biodiversity and ecosystem function. Effects of the symbiosis on plants span the continuum from mutualism to parasitism. We sought to understand this variation in symbiotic function using meta analysis with information theory based model selection to assess the relative importance of factors in five categories: (1) identity of the host plant and its functional characteristics (2) identity and type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal) (3) soil fertility (4) biotic complexity of the soil and (5) experimental location (laboratory vs. field). Across most subsets of the data host plant functional group and N fertilization were surprisingly much more important in predicting plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation (plant response) than other factors. Non N fixing forbs and woody plants and C(4) grasses responded more positively to mycorrhizal inoculation than plants with N fixing bacterial symbionts and C(3) grasses. In laboratory studies of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis plant response was more positive when the soil community was more complex. Univariate analyses supported the hypothesis that plant response is most positive when plants are P limited rather than N limited. These results emphasize that mycorrhizal function depends on both abiotic and biotic context and have implications for plant community theory and restoration ecology. 867:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phylogenetic information is increasingly being used to understand the assembly of biological communities and ecological processes. However commonly used metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD) do not incorporate information on the relative abundances of individuals within a community. In this study we develop three indices of PD that explicitly consider species abundances. First we present a metric of phylogenetic abundance evenness that evaluates the relationship between the abundance and the distribution of terminal branch lengths. Second we calculate an index of hierarchical imbalance of abundances at the clade level encapsulating the distribution of individuals across the nodes in the phylogeny. Third we develop an index of abundance weighted evolutionary distinctiveness and generate an entropic index of phylogenetic diversity that captures both information on evolutionary distances and phylogenetic tree topology and also serves as a basis to evaluate species conservation value. These metrics offer measures of phylogenetic diversity incorporating different community attributes. We compare these new metrics to existing ones and use them to explore diversity patterns in a typical California annual grassland plant community at the Jasper Ridge biological preserve.

The SAR is a central tool in conservation being used to predict species loss following global climate change and is striking in its universality throughout different geographical regions and across the tree of life. In this article we draw upon the methods of quantum field theory and the foundation of neutral community ecology to derive the first spatially explicit neutral prediction for the SAR. We find that the SAR has three phases with a power law increase at intermediate scales consistent with decades of documented empirical patterns. Our model also provides a building block for incorporating non neutral biological variation with the potential to bridge the gap between neutral and niche based approaches to community assembly. Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 87 95. 881:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species abundance distributions (SADs) follow one of ecologys oldest and most universal laws every community shows a hollow curve or hyperbolic shape on a histogram with many rare species and just a few common species. Here we review theoretical empirical and statistical developments in the study of SADs. Several key points emerge. (i) Literally dozens of models have been proposed to explain the hollow curve. Unfortunately very few models are ever rejected primarily because few theories make any predictions beyond the hollow curve SAD itself. (ii) Interesting work has been performed both empirically and theoretically which goes beyond the hollow curve prediction to provide a rich variety of information about how SADs behave. These include the study of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that integrate SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to this body of work is an effort to move beyond treating the SAD in isolation and to integrate the SAD into its ecological context to enable making many predictions. (iii) Moving forward will entail understanding how sampling and scale affect SADs and developing statistical tools for describing and comparing SADs. We are optimistic that SADs can provide significant insights into basic and applied ecological science. 882:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species abundance distributions (SADs) have played a historical role in the development of community ecology. They summarize information about the number and the relative abundance of the species encountered in a sample from a given community. For years ecologists have developed theory to characterize species abundance patterns and the study of these patterns has received special attention in recent years. In particular ecologists have developed statistical sampling theories to predict the SAD expected in a sample taken from a region. Here we emphasize an important limitation of all current sampling theories: they ignore species identity. We present an alternative formulation of statistical sampling theory that incorporates species asymmetries in sampling and dynamics and relate in a general way the community level SAD to the distribution of population abundances of the species integrating the community. We illustrate the theory on a stochastic community model that can accommodate species asymmetry. Finally we discuss the potentially important role of species asymmetries in shaping recently observed multi humped SADs and in comparisons of the relative success of niche and neutral theories at predicting SADs. 884:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species diversity and genetic diversity remain the nearly exclusive domains of community ecology and population genetics respectively despite repeated recognition in the literature over the past 30 years of close parallels between these two levels of diversity. Species diversity within communities and genetic diversity within populations are hypothesized to co vary in space or time because of locality characteristics that influence the two levels of diversity via parallel processes or because of direct effects of one level of diversity on the other via several different mechanisms. Here we draw on a wide range of studies in ecology and evolution to examine the theoretical underpinnings of these hypotheses review relevant empirical literature and outline an agenda for future research. The plausibility of species diversity genetic diversity relationships is supported by a variety of theoretical and empirical studies and several recent studies provide direct though preliminary support. Focusing on potential connections between species diversity and genetic diversity complements other approaches to synthesis at the ecology evolution interface and should contribute to conceptual unification of biodiversity research at the levels of genes and species. 899:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages between different spatial scales in ecology. Here we review current understanding about this concept. We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch dynamic view the species sorting view the mass effects view and the neutral view that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio temporal organization concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone. 900:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The pattern of woody species richness decline with a decrease in woody vegetation cover was studied within a tallgrass prairie. The decline in species richness is highly non linear with a well defined threshold below which species richness collapses. This relationship can be understood after considering information on how landscape structure changes with woody vegetation cover and how species richness is related to landscape structure. 901:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The processes controlling the abundances of species across multiple sites form the cornerstone of modern ecology. In these metacommunities the relative importance of local environmental and regional spatial processes is currently hotly debated especially in terms of the validity of neutral model. I collected 158 published data sets with information on community structure environmental and spatial variables. I showed that approximately 50 PeRcEnT of the variation in community composition is explained by both environmental and spatial variables. The majority of the data sets were structured by species sorting dynamics (SS) followed by a combination of SS and mass effect dynamics. While neutral processes were the only structuring process in 8 PeRcEnT of the collected natural communities disregarding neutral dispersal processes would result in missing important patterns in 37 PeRcEnT of the studied communities. Moreover metacommunity characteristics such as dispersal type habitat type and spatial scale predicted part of the detected variation in metacommunity structure. 902:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The relationship between species and functional diversity remains poorly understood for nearly all ecosystem types yet determining this relationship is critically important for developing both a mechanistic understanding of community assembly and appropriate expectations and approaches to protecting and restoring biological communities. Here we use two distinct data sets one from kelp forests in the Channel Islands California and one from a global synthesis of marine reserves to directly test how variation in species diversity translates into changes in functional diversity. We find strong positive relationships between species and functional diversity and increased functional diversity of fish assemblages coinciding with recovery of species diversity in marine reserves independent of the method used for classifying species in functional groups. These results indicate that low levels of redundancy in functional species traits exist across a suite of marine systems and that fishing tends to remove whole functional groups from coastal marine ecosystems. 903:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The species abundance distribution (SAD) is one of the few universal patterns in ecology. Research on this fundamental distribution has primarily focused on the study of numerical counts irrespective of the traits of individuals. Here we show that considering a set of Generalized Species Abundance Distributions (GSADs) encompassing several abundance measures such as numerical abundance biomass and resource use can provide novel insights into the structure of ecological communities and the forces that organize them. We use a taxonomically diverse combination of macroecological data sets to investigate the similarities and differences between GSADs. We then use probability theory to explore under parsimonious assumptions theoretical linkages among them. Our study suggests that examining different GSADs simultaneously in natural systems may help with assessing determinants of community structure. Broadening SADs to encompass multiple abundance measures opens novel perspectives in biodiversity research and warrants future empirical and theoretical developments. 906:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Theoretical analyses and experimental studies of synthesized assemblages indicate that under particular circumstances species diversity can enhance community productivity through niche complementarity. It remains unclear whether this process has important effects in mature natural ecosystems where competitive feedbacks and complex environmental influences affect diversity productivity relationships. In this study we evaluated diversity productivity relationships while statistically controlling for environmental influences in 12 natural grassland ecosystems. Because diversity productivity relationships are conspicuously nonlinear we developed a nonlinear structural equation modeling ( SEM) methodology to separate the effects of diversity on productivity from the effects of productivity on diversity. Meta analysis was used to summarize the SEM findings across studies. While competitive effects were readily detected enhancement of production by diversity was not. These results suggest that the influence of small scale diversity on productivity in mature natural systems is a weak force both in absolute terms and relative to the effects of other controls on productivity. 907:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Theories based on competition for resources predict a monotonic negative relationship between population density and individual biomass in plant populations. They do not consider the role of facilitative interactions which are known to be important in high stress environments. Using an individual based zone of influence model we investigated the hypothesis that the balance between facilitative and competitive interactions determines biomass density relationships. We tested model predictions with a field experiment on the clonal grass Elymus nutans in an alpine meadow. In the model the relationship between mean individual biomass and density shifted from monotonic to humped as abiotic stress increased. The model results were supported by the field experiment in which the greatest individual and population biomass were found at intermediate densities in a high stress alpine habitat. Our results show that facilitation can affect biomass density relationships. 908:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is little consensus about how natural  productivity disturbance) and anthropogenic  invasive species habitat destruction) ecological drivers influence biodiversity. Here we show that when sampling is standardised by area (species density) or individuals (rarefied species richness) the measured effect sizes depend critically on the spatial grain and extent of sampling as well as the size of the species pool. This compromises comparisons of effects sizes within studies using standard statistics as well as among studies using meta analysis. To derive an unambiguous effect size we advocate that comparisons need to be made on a scale independent metric such as Hurlberts Probability of Interspecific Encounter. Analyses of this metric can be used to disentangle the relative influence of changes in the absolute and relative abundances of individuals as well as their intraspecific aggregations in driving differences in biodiversity among communities. This and related approaches are necessary to achieve generality in understanding how biodiversity responds to ecological drivers and will necessitate a change in the way many ecologists collect and analyse their data. 939:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Cross scale resilience theory predicts that the combination of functional diversity within scales and functional redundancy across scales is an important attribute of ecosystems because it helps these systems resist minor ecological disruptions and regenerate after major disturbances such as hurricanes and fire. Using the vertebrate fauna of south Florida we quantified how the loss of native species and invasion by normatives may alter functional group richness within and across scales. We found that despite large changes in species composition due to potential extinctions and successful invasions by normative species functional group richness will not change significantly within scales there will not be any significant loss of overall redundancy of ecology function across scales and overall body mass pattern will not undergo substantial change. However the types of functions performed will change and this change may have profound effects on not only the Everglades ecosystem but On the entire landscape of south Florida. 95:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,97:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Theoretical and empirical studies in community ecology often simplify their study system by lumping together species on the basis of trait similarities ( e. g. their taxonomy resource or microhabitat usage) and then assume species sharing similar traits are functionally similar. To date no study has directly tested whether species more similar with respect to any of these traits are more similar in their functional effects on population or ecosystem processes. In this study we examined the association between traits and functional effects of six different aquatic predatory vertebrates. We demonstrated that functional similarity across multiple response variables was not correlated with trait similarity but differences in trait values were associated with significantly different effects on individual response variables. The exact relationship between species traits and functional effect of predators however was different for each response variable. Using traits to predict functional similarity among species may be useful when considering individual response variables but only if it is known which traits have the greatest influence on the response variable of interest. It is doubtful that any one scheme will predict the functional similarity of species across a diverse array of response variables because each response will likely be strongly influenced by different traits. 1024:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As climate change intensifies there is increasing interest in developing models that reduce uncertainties in projections of global climate and refine these projections to finer spatial scales. Forecasts of climate impacts on ecosystems are far more challenging and their uncertainties even larger because of a limited understanding of physical controls on biological systems. Management and conservation plans that explicitly account for changing climate are rare and even those generally rely on retrospective analyses rather than future scenarios of climatic conditions and associated responses of specific ecosystems. Using past biophysical relationships as a guide to predicting the impacts of future climate change assumes that the observed relationships will remain constant. However this assumption involves a long chain of uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions climate sensitivity to changes in greenhouse gases and the ecological consequences of climate change. These uncertainties in forecasting biological responses to changing climate highlight the need for resource management and conservation policies that are robust to unknowns and responsive to change. We Suggest how policy might develop despite substantial uncertainties about the future state of salmon ecosystems. 1054:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change is altering ecological systems throughout the world. Managing these systems in a way that ignores climate change will likely fail to meet management objectives. The uncertainty in projected climate change impacts is one of the greatest challenges facing managers attempting to address global change. In order to select successful management strategies managers need to understand the uncertainty inherent in projected climate impacts and how these uncertainties affect the outcomes of management activities. Perhaps the most important tool for managing ecological systems in the face of climate change is active adaptive management in which systems are closely monitored and management strategies are altered to address expected and ongoing changes. Here we discuss the uncertainty inherent in different types of data on potential climate impacts and explore climate projections and potential management responses at three sites in North America. The Central Valley of California the headwaters of the Klamath River in Oregon and the barrier islands and sounds of North Carolina each face a different set of challenges with respect to climate change. Using these three sites we provide specific examples of how managers are already beginning to address the threat of climate change in the face of varying levels of uncertainty. 1057:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Forestry including afforestation (the planting of trees on land where they have not recently existed) reforesta tion avoided deforestation and forest management can lead to increased sequestration of atmospheric carbor dioxide and has therefore been proposed as a strategy to mitigate climate change. However forestry also influ ences land surface properties including albedo (the fraction of incident sunlight reflected back to space) surface roughness and evapotranspiration all of which affect the amount and forms of energy transfer to the atmos phere. In some circumstances these biophysical feedbacks can result in local climate warming thereby counter acting the effects of carbon sequestration on global mean temperature and reducing or eliminating the net value of climate change mitigation projects. Here we review published and emerging research that suggests ways ir which forestry projects can counteract the consequences associated with biophysical interactions and highligh knowledge gaps in managing forests for climate protection. We also outline several ways in which biophysica effects can be incorporated into frameworks that use the maintenance of forests as a climate protection strategy 1080:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Precipitation is considered to be a key driver of ecosystem processes in mesic grasslands and climate models predict changes in the amount and intensity of precipitation under future global change scenarios. Although most experimental rainfall studies decrease precipitation seasonal rainfall is predicted to increase in the northern Great Plains under climate change. We analysed changes in community composition and structure of upland and lowland native tallgrass prairie in central Kansas USA subjected to 19 years of irrigation designed to eliminate moisture stress throughout the growing season. Irrigation had limited effects on species richness in both upland and lowland prairie. Total cover increased significantly and consistently with irrigation in drier uplands and in more mesic lowlands. Abundance of rhizomatous tall perennial species as well as C3 forbs increased with irrigation. The strongest response to irrigation came within the dominant functional type C4 perennial grasses. Panicum virgatum became the dominant species in irrigated lowlands whereas Andropogon gerardii remained the dominant species in irrigated uplands and in control plots. Overall irrigation had less effect on community composition and structure than other known drivers of grassland structure and function. In comparison with other studies our results demonstrate that water addition has less of an impact than fire grazing or nitrogen addition on composition and dynamics in this mesic grassland. The strongest response to long term irrigation occurred within the dominant functional type: tall perennial rhizomatous C4 grasses. Thus functional redundancy will buffer this ecosystem from potential increases in rainfall due to climate change. Finally our results highlight the limited utility of qualitative functional traits to predict how this mesic grassland will respond to climate change. 1081:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The pioneering work of Peter Eagleson has been proposed as a theoretical basis for ecohydrology. Central to the theory are three ecological optimality hypotheses which represent ecologically important aspects of atmosphere soil vegetation interactions. The model and its underlying assumptions have never been evaluated in an explicitly ecological context. We examine each of the three optimality hypotheses in turn and test the ability of the model to make ecologically relevant predictions using climate soil and vegetation data from a semi arid woodland site in central New Mexico USA. We find that all three of the optimality hypotheses are ecologically flawed. While we could qualitatively reproduce previously published results model behaviour under novel conditions was highly variable and frequently unrealistic. The poor performance of the model was probably due to the inadequate treatment of water limited transpiration in its original derivation. The theory thus requires redevelopment for ecological application and we suggest several strands of research that could contribute to its improvement. 1084:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change will alter the distribution and abundance of many species including those of concern to human health. Accurate predictions of these impacts must be based on an understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and organisms and a consideration of evolutionary responses. Here we use biophysical models of energy and mass transfer to predict climatic impacts on the potential range of the dengue fever vector Aedes aegypti in Australia. We develop a first principles approach to calculate water depth and daily temperature cycles in containers differing in size catchment and degree of shading to assess habitat suitability for the aquatic life cycle phase. We also develop a method to predict potential climatic impacts on the evolutionary response of traits limiting distribution. Our predictions show strong correspondence with the current and historical distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti in Australia suggesting that inland and northern limits are set by water availability and egg desiccation resistance and southern limits by adult and larval cold tolerance. While we predict that climate change will directly increase habitat suitability throughout much of Australia the potential indirect impact of changed water storage practices by humans in response to drought may have a greater effect. In northern Australia we show that evolutionary changes in egg desiccation resistance could potentially increase the chances of establishment in a major centre (Darwin) under climate change. Our study demonstrates how biophysical models of climate animal interactions can be applied to make decisions about managing biotic responses to climate change. Mechanistic models of the kind we apply here can provide more robust and general predictions than correlative analyses. They can also explicitly incorporate evolutionary responses the outcomes of which may significantly alter management decisions. 1086:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Global data sets of rooting depths long term means of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and soil texture were used to predict the probability of deep rooting around the globe. Rooting depths were considered to be deep if 5 PeRcEnT or more of all roots in a profile were located below 2 in depth. Spatially explicit global predictions were based on empirical models relating the probability of deep rooting with climate and soil texture. Based on these predictions deep roots are most likely to occur in seasonally dry semiarid to humid tropical regions under savanna or thorn scrub vegetation or under seasonally dry semideciduous to evergreen forests. Deep roots are least likely to occur in arctic boreal or cool temperate regions and in per humid climates such as equatorial rain forests. Under warm temperate to tropical climates rooting depths are more likely to be deep in coarse textured and fine textured soil than in soils of medium texture. These observations agree well with predictions based on a previously published conceptual model according to which water infiltration depths and evaporative demand are the main climatic factors to determine vertical root distributions on a global scale. 1090:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ongoing anthropogenic perturbations to the atmosphere and biosphere increase the risk of future abrupt changes in the climate system and generate concern about the ability of natural ecosystems to respond to rapid climate change. Study of past climatic events and biotic responses can inform us about potential future change. Qualitatively fast local responses of plant taxa to abrupt late glacial climate oscillations have been reported from individual records and attributed to short migration distances in areas of high topographic relief. By using quantitative time series analyses we show that vegetation responses to late glacial climate change around the North Atlantic were rapid and widespread and occurred in areas of differing relief. Cross correlation analysis of 11 high resolution lacustrine records in eastern North America and Europe indicates vegetation response times consistently of  200 yr and often  100 yr despite regional differences in physiography and species composition. Vegetation lags of  200 yr confirm theoretical predictions and the apparently tight coupling between vegetation and atmosphere suggests that recent climatic trends may already have begun to affect plant population abundances and distributions. 1095:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Accurate reconstructions of late Quaternary land cover change are needed to better understand past interactions of the terrestrial biosphere with other components of the earth system. This paper presents a sequence of reconstructed needleleaved and broadleaved tree cover densities for North America since the last glacial maximum generated from fossil pollen data and present day tree cover estimates derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). For this study a refined form of the modem analog technique was developed called the hierarchical analog technique which can constrain palcoenvironmental properties even for fossil pollen assemblages without close analogs in the modem pollen record. Pollen taxa from samples that are compositionally unlike any modem pollen samples are regrouped into plant functional categories based upon phenology life form leaf shape and climatic tolerances and the analog analysis rerun. Reclassifying individual pollen taxa into broader functional categories enables analogs to be found when no compositional analogs exist but at a cost of increased uncertainties in the analog estimates. Tests of the hierarchical analog technique shows that it accurately reconstructs present day tree cover densities. The median standard deviation for each individual estimate is  10 PeRcEnT. Tree cover densities during the last glacial maximum were low relative to present and have increased since. Lower than present tree cover densities at the last glacial maximum were likely due to a combination of low temperatures low precipitation and low atmospheric CO2 concentrations. By 14 ka broadleaved tree cover densities had begun to rise in the southeastern US and needleleaved forests grew in the western US southeastem US and as a belt along the southern margin of the Laurentide lee Sheet. By the mid Holocene the northern and western needleleaved forests had joined. Needleleaved and broadleaved tree densities continued to increase until European settlement. Mapping percent tree cover represents a useful alternative to biome based classification schemes enabling a fuller representation of vegetational gradients in space and time and can be directly compared to the tree distributions simulated by dynamic global vegetation models. In effect by calibrating the modem pollen data against the AVHRR derived estimates of tree cover the fossil pollen data are applied to extrapolate satellite based observations into the Quaternary enabling. study of vegetation dynamics and land cover change at timescales beyond the period of direct observation by engineered remote sensors. Analog based approaches however require extensive networks of surface and fossil pollen samples making further data collection a priority in sparsely sampled regions of the world. 1100:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Leaf surface area per unit ground cover (leaf area index LAI) is one of the major controls on plant productivity and biospheric feedbacks on atmospheric energy and water exchanges. Nearly all vegetation and land surface models include parameterizations of LAI however not much research currently focuses on the validation of simulated responses of LAI to environmental change. The objective of our research was to quantitatively review the plant science literature to extract information on the response of LAI to variations in soil moisture soil fertility and atmospheric CO(2). Our synthesis confirms that LAI is likely co limited by a number of resources including water nitrogen and light. Atmospheric CO2 influences LAI in much the same manner as other plant resources. When CO2 supply is strongly limiting to gross primary production  at relatively low CO2 concentrations) LAI is strongly correlated with CO(2) whereas when CO2 is abundant LAI sensitivity to CO(2) dramatically decreases. Such a nonlinear relationship between leaf area production and atmospheric CO(2) may introduce a potential bias for global change modeling particularly in the simulation of low density vegetation that has the potential to significantly increase canopy size without inducing self shading. 1108:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Assessing the ecological importance of clouds has substantial implications for our basic understanding of ecosystems and for predicting how they will respond to a changing climate. This study was conducted in a coastal Bishop pine forest ecosystem that experiences regular cycles of stratus cloud cover and inundation in summer. Our objective was to understand how these clouds impact ecosystem metabolism by contrasting two sites along a gradient of summer stratus cover. The site that was under cloud cover similar to 15 PeRcEnT more of the summer daytime hours had lower air temperatures and evaporation rates higher soil moisture content and received more frequent fog drip inputs than the site with less cloud cover. These cloud driven differences in environmental conditions translated into large differences in plant and microbial activity. Pine trees at the site with greater cloud cover exhibited less water stress in summer larger basal area growth and greater rates of sap velocity. The difference in basal area growth between the two sites was largely due to summer growth. Microbial metabolism was highly responsive to fog drip illustrated by an observed similar to 3 fold increase in microbial biomass C with increasing summer fog drip. In addition the site with more cloud cover had greater total soil respiration and a larger fractional contribution from heterotrophic sources. We conclude that clouds are important to the ecological functioning of these coastal forests providing summer shading and cooling that relieve pine and microbial drought stress as well as regular moisture inputs that elevate plant and microbial metabolism. These findings are important for understanding how these and other seasonally dry coastal ecosystems will respond to predicted changes in stratus cover rainfall and temperature. 1109:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Assessments of carbon (C) fluxes in the Arctic require detailed data on both how and why these fluxes vary across the landscape. Such assessments are complicated because tundra vegetation has diverse structure and function at both local and regional stales. To investigate this diversity the Arctic Flux Study has used the eddy covariance technique to generate ecosystem CO2 exchange data along a transect in northern Alaska. We use an extant process based model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum to make independent predictions of grass photosynthesis and foliar respiration at 9 of the sites along the transect using data on local canopy structure and meteorology. We make two key assumptions: (i) soil respiration is constant throughout the flux measurement period so that the diurnal cycle in CO2 exchange is driven by canopy processes only (except at two sites where a soil respiration temperature relationship was indicated in the data); and (ii) mosses and lichens play an insignificant role in ecosystem C exchange even though in some locations their live biomass exceeds 300 g m( 2). We found that even with these assumptions the model could explain much of the dynamics of net ecosystem production (NEP) at sites with widely differing vegetation structure and moss lichen cover. Errors were mostly associated with the predictions of maximum NEP; the likely cause of such discrepancies was (i) a mismatch between vegetation sampled for characterizing the canopy structure and that contained within the footprint of the eddy covariance flux measurements or (ii) an increase in daytime soil and root respiration. Thus the model results tended to falsify our first assumption but not our second. We also note evidence for an actual reduction in NEP caused by water stress on warm dry days at some sites The model flux comparison also suggests that photosynthesis may be less sensitive to low temperatures than leaf level gas exchange measurements have indicated. 1112:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Current land cover classifications used for global modelling portray Arctic tundra as one or two classes. This is insufficient for analysis of climate vegetation interactions. This paper presents a simple three level vegetation map legend system useful for modelling at global regional and landscape scales. At the highest level (global scale: 10(7) 10(8) km(2)) the Tundra Zone is divided into four subzones based on vegetation response to temperature along the latitudinal temperature gradient from north to south: (1) Cushion forb (2) Prostrate Dwarf shrub (3) Erect Dwarf shrub and (4) Low Shrub subzones. The boundaries follow a modification of Yurtsevs phytogeographic subzones. Parent material and topography are also major considerations at global regional and landscape scales. Soil pH is a key variable for many ecosystem responses and a division into acidic (pH 5.5 or less) and nonacidic soils is used. A conceptual mesotopographic gradient is used to characterize the influence of soil moisture and snow regimes. The example legend framework focuses on the Northern Alaska floristic subprovince and could be expanded to other floristic provinces using local expert knowledge and available literature. Dominant plant functional types within each habitat type within the four subzones are also presented. Modellers could include or ignore different levels of resolution depending on the purpose of the model. The approach resolves conflicts in terminology that have previously been encountered between the Russian North American and Fennoscandian approaches to Arctic zonation. 1113:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Data from a sparse network of climate stations in Alaska were interpolated to provide 1 km resolution maps of mean monthly temperature and precipitation variables that are required at high spatial resolution for input into regional models of ecological processes and resource management. The interpolation model is based on thin plate smoothing splines which uses the spatial data along with a digital elevation model to incorporate local topography. The model provides maps that are consistent with regional climatology and with patterns recognized by experienced weather forecasters. The broad patterns of Alaskan climate are well represented and include latitudinal and altitudinal trends in temperature and precipitation and gradients in continentality. Variations within these broad patterns reflect both the weakening and reduction in frequency of low pressure centres in their eastward movement across southern Alaska during the summer and the shift of the storm tracks into central and northern Alaska in late summer. Not surprisingly apparent artifacts of the interpolated climate occur primarily in regions with few or no stations. The interpolation model did not accurately represent low level winter temperature inversions that occur within large valleys and basins. Along with well recognized climate patterns the model captures local topographic effects that would not be depicted using standard interpolation techniques. This suggests that similar procedures could be used to generate high resolution maps for other high latitude regions with a sparse density of data. 1116:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Disturbance regimes strongly determine vegetation patterns and succession in the boreal landscape. One of the current challenges for boreal vegetation modellers is to represent disturbance agents as dynamic factors that can respond to climate change. Outbreak species of insects and plant pathogens can cause marked changes in vegetation patterns and should be incorporated into vegetation change models. This introduction to the ecology of boreal biotic disturbance agents is designed as a brief overview for global change researchers and modellers. We discuss the importance of biotic disturbance agents in the boreal forest offer an overview of their ecology and review modelling approaches. We illustrate these issues with examples from different systems drawing largely from our experience with bark beetles. 1117:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Forecasting how species and ecosystems will respond to climate change has been a major aim of ecology in recent years. Much of this research has focused on phenology the timing of life history events. Phenology has well demonstrated links to climate from genetic to landscape scales; yet our ability to explain and predict variation in phenology across species habitats and time remains poor. Here we outline how merging approaches from ecology climate science and evolutionary biology can advance research on phenological responses to climate variability. Using insight into seasonal and interannual climate variability combined with niche theory and community phylogenetics we develop a predictive approach for species reponses to changing climate. Our approach predicts that species occupying higher latitudes or the early growing season should be most sensitive to climate and have the most phylogenetically conserved phenologies. We further predict that temperate species will respond to climate change by shifting in time while tropical species will respond by shifting space or by evolving. Although we focus here on plant phenology our approach is broadly applicable to ecological research of plant responses to climate variability. 1118:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, High resolution data collected over the past 60 years by a single family of Siberian scientists on Lake Baikal reveal significant warming of surface waters and long term changes in the basal food web of the worlds largest most ancient lake. Attaining depths over 1.6 km Lake Baikal is the deepest and most voluminous of the worlds great lakes. Increases in average water temperature (1.21 degrees C since 1946) chlorophyll a (300 PeRcEnT since 1979) and an influential group of zooplankton grazers (335 PeRcEnT increase in cladocerans since 1946) may have important implications for nutrient cycling and food web dynamics. Results from multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modeling suggest that cladocerans increased strongly in response to temperature but not to algal biomass and cladocerans depressed some algal resources without observable fertilization effects. Changes in Lake Baikal are particularly significant as an integrated signal of long term regional warming because this lake is expected to be among those most resistant to climate change due to its tremendous volume. These findings highlight the importance of accessible long term monitoring data for understanding ecosystem response to large scale stressors such as climate change. 1119:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Historical and projected climate trends for high latitudes show substantial temporal and spatial variability. To identify uncertainties in simulating carbon (C) dynamics for pan Arctic tundra we compare the historical and projected responses of tundra C storage from 1921 to 2100 between simulations by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) for the pan Arctic and the Kuparuk River Basin which was the focus of an integrated study of C dynamics from 1994 to 1996. In the historical period from 1921 to 1994 the responses of net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (R(H)) Simulated for the Kuparuk River Basin and the pan Arctic are correlated with the same factors; NPP is positively correlated with net nitrogen mineralization (NMIN) and R(H) is negatively correlated with mean annual soil moisture. In comparison to the historical period the spatially aggregated responses of NPP and R(H) for the Kuparuk River Basin and the pan Arctic in our simulations for the projected period have different sensitivities to temperature soil moisture and NMIN. In addition to being sensitive to soil moisture during the projected period R(H) is also sensitive to temperature and there is a significant correlation between R(H) and NMIN. We interpret the increases in NPP during the projected period as being driven primarily by increases in NMIN and that the correlation between NPP and temperature in the projected period is a result primarily of the causal linkage between temperature R(H) and NMIN. Although similar factors appear to be controlling simulated regional and biome scale C dynamics simulated C dynamics at the two scales differ in magnitude with higher increases in C storage simulated for the Kuparuk River Basin than for the pan Arctic at the end of the historical period and throughout the projected period. Also the results of the simulations indicate that responses of C storage show different climate sensitivities at regional and pan Arctic spatial scales and that these sensitivities change across the temporal scope of the simulations. The results of the TEM simulations indicate that the scaling of C dynamics to a region of arctic tundra may not represent C dynamics of pan Arctic tundra because of the limited spatial variation in climate and vegetation within a region relative to the pan Arctic. For reducing uncertainties our analyses highlight the importance of incorporating the understanding gained from process level studies of C dynamics in a region of arctic tundra into process based models that simulate C dynamics in a spatially explicit fashion across the spatial domain of pan Arctic tundra. Also efforts to improve gridded datasets of historical climate for the pan Arctic would advance the ability to assess the responses of C dynamics for pan Arctic tundra in a more realistic fashion. A major challenge will be to incorporate topographic controls over soil moisture in assessing the response of C storage for pan Arctic tundra. 1129:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Synthesis of results from several Arctic and boreal research programmes provides evidence for the strong role of high latitude ecosystems in the climate system. Average surface air temperature has increased 0.3 degrees C per decade during the twentieth century in the western North American Arctic and boreal forest zones. Precipitation has also increased but changes in soil moisture are uncertain. Disturbance rates have increased in the boreal forest; for example there has been a doubling of the area burned in North America in the past 20 years. The disturbance regime in tundra may not have changed. Tundra has a 3 6 fold higher winter albedo than boreal forest but summer albedo and energy partitioning differ more strongly among ecosystems within either tundra or boreal forest than between these two biomes. This indicates a need to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics within as well as between biomes. If regional surface warming were to continue changes in albedo and energy absorption would likely act as a positive feedback to regional warming due to earlier melting of snow and over the long term the northward movement of treeline. Surface drying and a change in dominance from mosses to vascular plants would also enhance sensible heat flux and regional warming in tundra. In the boreal forest of western North America deciduous forests have twice the albedo of conifer forests in both winter and summer 50 80 PeRcEnT higher evapotranspiration and therefore only 30 50 PeRcEnT of the sensible heat flux of conifers in summer. Therefore a warming induced increase in fire frequency that increased the proportion of deciduous forests in the landscape would act as a negative feedback to regional warming. Changes in thermokarst and the aerial extent of wetlands lakes and ponds would alter high latitude methane flux. There is currently a wide discrepancy among estimates of the size and direction of CO2 flux between high latitude ecosystems and the atmosphere. These discrepancies relate more strongly to the approach and assumptions for extrapolation than to inconsistencies in the underlying data. Inverse modelling from atmospheric CO2 concentrations suggests that high latitudes are neutral or net sinks for atmospheric CO2 whereas field measurements suggest that high latitudes are neutral or a net CO2 source. Both approaches rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify. The most parsimonious explanation of the available data is that drying in tundra and disturbance in boreal forest enhance CO2 efflux. Nevertheless many areas of both tundra and boreal forests remain net sinks due to regional variation in climate and local variation in topographically determined soil moisture. Improved understanding of the role of high latitude ecosystems in the climate system requires a concerted research effort that focuses on geographical variation in the processes controlling land atmosphere exchange species composition and ecosystem structure. Future studies must be conducted over a long enough time period to detect and quantify ecosystem feedbacks. 1130:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The boreal forest one of the worlds larger biomes is distinct from other biomes because it experiences a short growing season and extremely cold winter temperatures. Despite its size and impact on the earths climate system measurements of mass and energy exchange have been rare until the past five years. This paper overviews results of recent and comprehensive field studies conducted in Canada Siberia and Scandinavia on energy exchanges between boreal forests and the atmosphere. How the boreal biosphere and atmosphere interact to affect the interception of solar energy and how solar energy is used to evaporate water and heat the air and soil is examined in detail. Specifically we analyse the magnitudes temporal and spatial patterns and controls of solar energy moisture and sensible heat fluxes across the land atmosphere interface. We interpret and synthesize field data with the aid of a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model which considers the coupling of the energy and carbon fluxes and nutrient status. Low precipitation and low temperatures limit growth of many boreal forests. These factors restrict photosynthetic capacity and lower root hydraulic conductivity and stomatal conductance of the inhabitant forests. In such circumstances these factors interact to form a canopy that has a low leaf area index and exerts a significant resistance to evaporation. Conifer forests growing on upland soils for example evaporate at rates between 25 and 75 PeRcEnT of equilibrium evaporation and lose less than 2.5 mm day( 1) of water. The open nature of many boreal conifer forest stands causes a disproportionate amount of energy exchange to occur at the soil surface. The climatic and physiological factors that yield relatively low rates of evaporation over conifer stands also cause high rates of sensible heat exchange and the diurnal development of deep planetary boundary layers. In contrast evaporation from broad leaved aspen stands and fen wetlands approach equilibrium evaporation rates and lose up to 6 mm day( 1). 1131:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The large magnitude of predicted warming at high latitudes and the potential feedback of ecosystems to atmospheric CO2 concentrations make it important to quantify both warming and its effects on high latitude carbon balance. We analysed long term daily surface meteorological records for 13 sites in Alaska and north western Canada and an 82 y record of river ice breakup date for the Tanana River in interior Alaska. We found increases in winter and spring temperature extrema for all sites with the greatest increases in spring minimum temperature average 0.47 degrees C per 10y and a 0.7 day per 10y advance in ice breakup on the Tanana River. We used the climate records to drive an ecosystem process model BIOME BGC to simulate the effects of climate change on the carbon and water balances of boreal forest ecosystems. The growing season has lengthened by an average of 2.6 days per 10y with an advance in average leaf onset date of 1.10 days per 10y. This advance in the start of the active growing season correlates positively with progressively earlier ice breakup on the Tanana River in interior Alaska. The advance in the start of the growing season resulted in a 20 PeRcEnT increase in net primary production for both aspen (Populus tremuloides) and white spruce (Picea glauca) stands. Aspen had a greater mean increase in maintenance respiration than spruce whereas spruce had a greater mean increase in evapotranspiration. Average decomposition rates also increased for both species. Both net primary production and decomposition are enhanced in our simulations suggesting that productive forest types may not experience a significant shift in net carbon nux as a result of climate warming. 1133:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper examines with examples controls on the energy and water balance of northern wetlands. Most wetlands have organic soils and are thus peatlands. High latitude wetlands are underlain by ice rich permafrost which helps maintain wetland systems and also imparts special characteristics to their energy and water balances. In North America components of the radiation balance decrease linearly poleward whereas the poleward rate of decrease of temperature and precipitation lessens. During the four month summer of a high subarctic wetland net radiation is large and the latent heat nux dominates the energy cycle. The ground heat flux is substantial especially in early summer when the ice rich ground is rapidly thawing. Winter begins in October and heat loss from the ground approximately balances negative net radiation. The summer energy and water balance differs among ten;ain units. Large shallow lakes exhibit larger net radiation and potential evaporation rates than surrounding wetland surfaces which in turn exhibit substantially larger magnitudes than dryland terrain. There is a variable withdrawal rate of soil moisture depending on soil types and plant rooting characteristics which influences the actual evaporation from the surface. Synoptic weather systems play a major role in day to day energy and water responses to climate forcing. Long term modelling of the water balance of a wetland shows year to year persistence in climatic patterns. Although net radiation temperature and precipitation all influence the magnitudes of water deficit the precipitation inputs are of paramount importance. Our ability to fully understand model and extrapolate in space and time the major controls on the surface climate of wetlands is evaluated. Spatial extrapolation is seen to be more readily achieved than temporal extrapolation. 1134:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper summarizes and analyses available data on the surface energy balance of Arctic tundra and boreal forest. The complex interactions between ecosystems and their surface energy balance are also examined including climatically induced shifts in ecosystem type that might amplify or reduce the effects of potential climatic change. High latitudes are characterized by large annual changes in solar input. Albedo decreases strongly from winter when the surface is snow covered to summer especially in nonforested regions such as Arctic tundra and boreal wetlands. Evapotranspiration (Q(E)) of high latitude ecosystems is less than from a freely evaporating surface and decreases late in the season when soil moisture declines indicating stomatal control over Q(E) particularly in evergreen forests. Evergreen conifer forests have a canopy conductance half that of deciduous forests and consequently lower Q(E) and higher sensible heat flux (Q(H)) There is a broad overlap in energy partitioning between Arctic and boreal ecosystems although Arctic ecosystems and light taiga generally have higher ground heat flux because there is less leaf and stem area to shade the ground surface and the thermal gradient from the surface to permafrost is steeper. Permafrost creates a strong heat sink in summer that reduces surface temperature and therefore heat flux to the atmosphere. Loss of permafrost would therefore amplify climatic warming. If warming caused an increase in productivity and leaf area or fire caused a shift from evergreen to deciduous forest this would increase Q(E) and reduce Q(H). Potential future shifts in vegetation would have varying climate feedbacks with largest effects caused by shifts from boreal conifer to shrubland or deciduous forest (or vice versa) and from Arctic coastal to wet tundra. An increase of logging activity in the boreal forests appears to reduce Q(E) by roughly 50 PeRcEnT with little change in Q(H) while the ground heat flux is strongly enhanced. 1137:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the distribution and function of Arctic and boreal ecosystems under current conditions and their vulnerability to altered forcing is crucial to our assessment of future global environmental change. Such efforts can be facilitated by the development and application of ecological models that simulate realistic patterns of vegetation change at high latitudes. This paper reviews three classes of ecological models that have been implemented to extrapolate vegetation information in space  across the Arctic and adjacent domains) and over historical and future periods  under altered climate and other forcings). These are: (i) equilibrium biogeographical models; (ii) frame based transient ecosystem models and (iii) dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). The equilibrium response of high latitude vegetation to scenarios of increased surface air temperatures projected by equilibrium biogeographical models is for tundra to be replaced by a northward shift of boreal woodland and forests. A frame based model (ALFRESCO) indicates the same directional changes but illustrates how response time depends on rate of temperature increase and concomitant changes in moisture regime and fire disturbance return period. Key disadvantages of the equilibrium models are that they do not simulate time dependent responses of vegetation and the role of disturbance is omitted or highly generalized. Disadvantages of the frame based models are that vegetation type is modelled as a set unit as opposed to an association of individually simulated plant functional types and that the role of ecosystem biogeochemistry in succession is not explicitly considered. DGVMs explicitly model disturbance  fire) operate on plant functional types and incorporate constraints of nutrient availability on biomass production in the simulation of vegetation dynamics. Under changing climate DGVMs detail conversion of tundra to tree dominated boreal landscapes along with time dependent responses of biomass net primary production and soil organic matter turnover which all increase with warming. Key improvements to DGVMs that are needed to portray behaviour of arctic and boreal ecosystems adequately are the inclusion of anaerobic soil processes for inundated landscapes permafrost dynamics and moss lichen layer biogeochemistry as well as broader explicit accounting of disturbance regimes (including insect outbreaks and land management). Transient simulation of these landscapes can be further tailored to high latitude processes and issues by spatially interactive gridded application of arctic boreal frame based models and development of dynamic regional vegetation models (DRVMs) utilizing plant functional type schemes that capture the variety of high latitude environments. 1138:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the impacts of climate on migratory species is complicated by the fact that these species travel through several climates that may be changing in diverse ways throughout their complete migratory cycle. Most studies are not designed to tease out the direct and indirect effects of climate at various stages along the migration route. We assess the impacts of spring and summer climate conditions on breeding monarch butterflies a species that completes its annual migration cycle over several generations. No single broad scale climate metric can explain summer breeding phenology or the substantial year to year fluctuations observed in population abundances. As such we built a Poisson regression model to help explain annual arrival times and abundances in the Midwestern United States. We incorporated the climate conditions experienced both during a spring migration breeding phase in Texas as well as during subsequent arrival and breeding during the main recruitment period in Ohio. Using data from a state wide butterfly monitoring network in Ohio our results suggest that climate acts in conflicting ways during the spring and summer seasons. High spring precipitation in Texas is associated with the largest annual population growth in Ohio and the earliest arrival to the summer breeding ground as are intermediate spring temperatures in Texas. On the other hand the timing of monarch arrivals to the summer breeding grounds is not affected by climate conditions within Ohio. Once in Ohio for summer breeding precipitation has minimal impacts on overall abundances whereas warmer summer temperatures are generally associated with the highest expected abundances yet this effect is mitigated by the average seasonal temperature of each location in that the warmest sites receive no benefit of above average summer temperatures. Our results highlight the complex relationship between climate and performance for a migrating species and suggest that attempts to understand how monarchs will be affected by future climate conditions will be challenging. 1140:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We are developing a process based modelling approach to investigate how carbon (C) storage of tundra across the entire Arctic will respond to projected climate change. To implement the approach the processes that are least understood and thus have the most uncertainty need to be identified and studied. In this paper we identified a key uncertainty by comparing the responses of C storage in tussock tundra at one site between the simulations of two models one a global scale ecosystem model (Terrestrial Ecosystem Model TEM) and one a plot scale ecosystem model (General Ecosystem Model GEM). The simulations spanned the historical period (1921 94) and the projected period (1995 2100). In the historical period the model simulations of net primary production (NPP) differed in their sensitivity to variability in climate. However the long term changes in C storage were similar in both simulations because the dynamics of heterotrophic respiration (R(H)) were similar in both models. In contrast the responses of C storage in the two model simulations diverged during the projected period. In the GEM simulation for this period increases in R(H) tracked increases in NPP whereas in the TEM simulation increases in RH lagged increases in NPP. We were able to make the long term C dynamics of the two simulations agree by parameterizing TEM to the fast soil C pools of GEM. We concluded that the differences between the long term C dynamics of the two simulations lay in modelling the role of the recalcitrant soil C. These differences which reflect an incomplete understanding of soil processes lead to quite different projections of the response of pan Arctic C storage to global change. For example the reference parameterization of TEM resulted in an estimate of cumulative C storage of 2032 gC m( 2) for moist tundra north of 50 degrees N which was substantially higher than the 463 g C m( 2) estimated for a parameterization of fast soil C dynamics. This uncertainty in the depiction of the role of recalcitrant soil C in long term ecosystem C dynamics resulted from our incomplete understanding of controls over C and N transformations in Arctic soils. Mechanistic studies of these issues are needed to improve our ability to model the response of Arctic ecosystems to global change. 1147:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Individually focused conservation management of many species is expensive and logistically impractical. Mesofilter conservation methods may facilitate the simultaneous management of multiple species. We used data on distributions of two sets of avian guilds based on dependence on riparian vegetation and on nest location to relate occurrence rates to environmental variables. Variables were selected by expert opinion and are likely to be affected by changes in climate and land use. Data were collected from 2001 06 in four adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander Nye and Eureka counties Nevada USA): the Shoshone Mountains and the Toiyabe Toquima and Monitor ranges. Data on occurrence of birds vegetation composition and vegetation structure were obtained in the field. Geographical coordinates and the normalized difference vegetation index were derived from a digital elevation model and a satellite image. To construct a general model for guilds as a whole while allowing flexibility for variation in the functional responses of individual species we applied multivariate adaptive regression splines. The predictive capacity of expert knowledge of relationships between birds and vegetation was inconsistent. Latitude longitude and elevation may constrain the response of some guilds to changes in vegetation structure and composition. Guild based models were useful for modelling species with sparse distributions which are difficult to model individually. In essence this method supplements models for the individual species with patterns for the guild to which they belong. Guilds of birds appeared to have predictable associations with selected attributes of vegetation structure and composition. The criteria by which species are grouped into guilds may affect the success of predictions and management interventions. Our derived models offer the potential to predict effects on the avifauna of management or climate driven change in vegetation. 1149:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most predictions of species ranges are based on correlating current species localities to environmental conditions. These correlative models do not explicitly include a species biology. In contrast some mechanistic models link traits to energetics and population dynamics to predict species distributions. These models enable one to ask whether considering a species biology is important for predicting its range. I implement mechanistic models to investigate how a species morphology physiology and life history influence its range. North America. I compare the mechanistic model predictions with those of correlative models for eight species of North American lizards in both current environments and following a uniform 3 degrees C temperature warming. I then examine the implications of superimposing habitat and elevation requirements on constraints associated with environmental tolerances. In the mechanistic model species with a narrower thermal range for activity are both predicted and observed to have more restricted distributions. Incorporating constraints on habitat and elevation further restricts species distributions beyond areas that are thermally suitable. While correlative models generally outperform mechanistic models at predicting current distributions the performance of mechanistic models improves when incorporating additional factors. In response to a 3 degrees C temperature warming the northward range shifts predicted by the mechanistic model vary between species according to trait differences and are of a greater extent than those predicted by correlative models. These findings highlight the importance of species traits for understanding the dynamics of species ranges in changing environments. The analysis demonstrates that mechanistic models may provide an important complement to correlative models for predicting range dynamics which may underpredict climate induced range shifts. 1167:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Both fossil pollen records and satellite based instruments are remote sensors of Earths vegetation with complementary properties. Satellites supply spatially continuous and highly resolved images for the past several decades whereas pollen records include local and regional signals of vegetation composition spanning millennia. Together pollen and satellite based observations measure vegetation change across a broad range of temporal scales. Here we compare pollen percentages of needleleaved and broadleaved plant taxa to AVHRR estimates of percent tree cover for two regions in eastern North America with well defined physiognomic gradients. The linear fit between the pollen percentages and percent tree cover is strongest for search window half widths of 25 75 km and unweighted or inverse distance weightings consistent with previous taxon based studies of regional pollen source area and transport. Variance not explained by the linear model arises primarily from differential properties of the AVHRR and pollen sensors particularly site specific variability in the pollen data and intertaxonomic differences in pollen representation. These sources of variance can be minimized by regionally smoothing the pollen data and multivariate analogue approaches. A strong fit between observed tree cover percentages and best analogue estimates (r(2) equals 0.70 to 0.78) suggests that analogue based methods can be applied to infer past tree cover proportions from fossil pollen records. Linking pollen and AVHRR observations in this manner effectively extrapolates satellite derived variables beyond the few decades of direct observation enabling study of longer term variations in land cover and impacts upon climate and the terrestrial carbon cycle. 1178:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper describes the use of it continuous streamflow model to examine the effects of climate and land use change on flow duration in six urbanizing watersheds in the Maryland Piedmont region. The hydrologic model is coupled with an optimization routine to achieve an agreement between observed and Simulated streamflow. Future predictions are made for three scenarios: future climate change land use change and jointly varying climate and land use. Future climate is modelled using precipitation and temperature predictions for the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) and Hadley climate models. Results show that a significant increase in temperature Under the CCC climate predictions produces a decreasing trend in low flows. A significant increasing trend in precipitation under the Hadley climate predictions produces an increasing trend in peak flows. Land use change by itself. as simulated by an additional 10 PeRcEnT increase in imperviousness (from 20.5 to 30.5 PeRcEnT) produces no significant changes in the simulated flow durations. However coupling the effects of land use change with climate change leads to more significant decreasing trends in low flows under the CCC climate predictions and more the significant increasing trends in peak flows under Hadley climate predictions than when climate change alone is employed. These findings indicate that combined land use and climate chance can result in more significant hydrologic change than either driver acting alone.  1191:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although climates are rapidly changing on a global scale these changes cannot easily be extrapolated to the local scales experienced by organisms. In fact such generalizations might be quite problematic. For instance models used to predict shifts in the ranges of species during climate change rarely incorporate data resolved to   1 km(2) although most organisms integrate climatic drivers at much smaller scales. Empirical studies alone suggest that the operative temperatures of many organisms vary by as much as 10 20 degrees C on a local scale depending on vegetation geology and topography. Furthermore this variation in abiotic factors ignores thermoregulatory behaviors that many animals use to balance heat loads. Through a set of simulations we demonstrate how variability in elevational topography can attenuate the effects of warming climates. These simulations suggest that changing climates do not always impact organisms negatively. Importantly these simulations involve well known relationships in biophysical ecology that show how no two organisms experience the same climate in the same way. We suggest that when coupled with thermoregulatory behavior variation in topographic features can mask the acute effect of climate change in many cases. 1194:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This study uses a spatially explicit microclimate biophysical approach to examine the potential distribution of the Poouli on Maui to find either new habitats to search for existence or refine search efforts in previously occupied areas. We used specific physiological and behavioral ecology bird data and Poouli morphological and spectral data obtained from museum specimens to address ecological and conservation related questions about the Poouli that are other wise very difficult to quantify. Laboratory and field tested microclimate and biophysical behavioral animal computer models were integrated with remote sensing technologies. To show that the generic microclimate and enclotherm models can predict metabolic and water loss requirements of Hawaiian Honeycreepers we used the 2 species with known physiological properties the Hawaiian Amakihi Hemignathus virens and the Hawaiian Anianiau Hemignathus parvus. Predictions were within experimental measurement error of the laboratory measurements. Then using field rather than laboratory conditions as input data we predict the field distribution of the Amakihi on Maui as the first spatial test of the models applied to birds. Results are consistent with Amakihi field distribution data. Fossils show that the Poouli once lived on Maui at low elevations in dry mesic habitats on a likely diet of native tree snails and insects. The arrival of lethal mosquito borne avian malaria in Hawaii exterminated low elevation Poouli forcing a population shift to mountain rainforests and possibly a snail diet instead of insects. To explore the maximum consequences of such a diet shift we assumed exclusive diets of snails versus insects at both low and high elevations. Snail diets require similar to 4 times higher foraging rates than do insect diets making a predominantly snail diet an unlikely prospect for the Poouli. Landscape scale simulations suggest that a snail diet would force a Poouli distribution inconsistent with observations. A predominantly insect diet is consistent with distribution observations. We show that as local environmental conditions change across the landscape in space and diurnal seasonal time it is possible to quantify animal physiological and behavioral consequences of those variations in their local environment. This enables quantification of the requisite spatial and temporal distribution and amount or availability of resources that may affect species potential for survival growth reproduction and distribution. 1195:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We explore in this paper how animals can be affected by variation in climate topography vegetation characteristics and body size. We utilize new spatially explicit state of the art models that incorporate principles from heat and mass transfer engineering physiology morphology and behavior that have been modified to provide spatially explicit hypotheses using GIS. We demonstrate how temporal and spatial changes in microclimate resulting from differences in topography and vegetation cover alter animal energetics and behavior. We explore the impacts of these energetic predictions on elk energetics in burned and unburned stands of conifer in winter in Yellowstone National Park chuckwalla lizard distribution limits in North America California Beechey Ground squirrel and Dusky Footed woodrat mass and energy requirements and activity patterns on the landscape their predator prey interactions with a rattlesnake Crotalus viridis and shifts in that food web structure due to topographic and vegetative variation. We illustrate how different scales of data observation provide different pieces of information that may collectively define the real distributions of a species. We then use sensitivity analyses of energetic models to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of changes in core temperature (fever) global climate (increased air temperature under a global warming scenario) and vegetation cover (deforestation) on winter survival of elk the geographic distribution of chuckwallas and the activity overlap of predator and prey species within a subset of commonly observed species in a terrestrial food web. Variation in slope and aspect affect the spatial variance in solar radiation incident on the ground hence ground surface temperature at the same elevation same hourly 2 m air temperatures and wind speeds. We illustrate visually how spatial effects and landscape heterogeneity make statistical descriptions of animal responses problematic since multiple distributions of their responses to climate topography and vegetation on the landscape can yield the same descriptive statistics especially at high (30 m) resolution. This preliminary analysis suggests that the model has far reaching implications for hypothesis testing in ecology at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. 1201:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Detrended modelled first leaf dates for 856 sites across North America for the period 19002008 are used to examine how the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) separately and together might influence the timing of spring. Although spring (mean March through April) ENSO and PDO signals are apparent in first leaf dates the signals are not statistically significant (at a 95 PeRcEnT confidence level (p   0.05)) for most sites. The most significant ENSO PDO signal in first leaf dates occurs for El Nino and positive PDO conditions. An analysis of the spatial distributions of first leaf dates for separate and combined ENSO PDO conditions features a northwestsoutheast dipole that is significantly (at p   0.05) different than the distributions for neutral conditions. The nature of the teleconnection between Pacific SSTs and first leaf dates is evident in comparable composites for detrended sea level pressure (SLP) in the spring months. During positive ENSO PDO there is an anomalous flow of warm air from the southwestern US into the northwestern US and an anomalous northeasterly flow of cold air from polar regions into the eastern and southeastern US. These flow patterns are reversed during negative ENSO PDO. Although the magnitudes of first leaf date departures are not necessarily significantly related to ENSO and PDO the spatial patterns of departures are significantly related to ENSO and PDO. These significant relations and the long lived persistence of SSTs provide a potential tool for forecasting the tendencies for first leaf dates to be early or late.  120:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1221:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most predictions about species responses to climate change ignore species interactions. Helland and colleagues (2011) test whether this assumption is valid by evaluating whether ice cover affects competition between brown trout Salmo trutta (L.) and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpines (L.) . They show that increasing ice cover correlates with lower trout biomass when Arctic charr co occur but not in charrs absence. In experiments charr grew better in the cold dark environments that typify ice covered lakes. Decreasing ice cover with warmer winters could mean more trout and fewer charr. More generally their results provide an excellent example suggesting that species interactions can strongly modify responses to climate change. 1229:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and other Pacific salmon are threatened by unsustainable levels of harvest genetic introgression from hatchery stocks and degradation or loss of freshwater habitat. Projected climate change is expected to further stress salmon through increases in stream temperatures and altered stream flows. We demonstrate a spatially explicit method for assessing salmon vulnerability to projected climatic changes (scenario for the years 2030 2059) applied here to steelhead salmon across the entire Pacific Northwest (PNW). We considered steelhead exposure to increased temperatures and more extreme high and low flows during four of their primary freshwater life stages: adult migration spawning incubation and rearing. Steelhead sensitivity to climate change was estimated on the basis of their regulatory status and the condition of their habitat. We assessed combinations of exposure and sensitivity to suggest actions that may be most effective for reducing steelhead vulnerability to climate change. Our relative ranking of locations suggested that steelhead exposure to increases in temperature will be most widespread in the southern Pacific Northwest whereas exposure to substantial flow changes will be most widespread in the interior and northern Pacific Northwest. There were few locations where we projected that steelhead had both relatively low exposure and sensitivity to climate change. There are few areas where habitat protection alone is likely to be sufficient to conserve steelhead under the scenario of climate change considered here. Instead our results suggest the need for coordinated landscape scale actions that both increase salmon resilience and ameliorate climate change impacts such as restoring connectivity of floodplains and high elevation habitats. 1236:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Remote sensing has been used as a tool for mapping land cover since sources of data became readily available in the 1970s. Spectral temporal and textural differences among satellite images allow users to distinguish among broad classes of vegetation. However the applicability of remote sensing to classification breaks down at the species level. General categories of vegetation such as deciduous and coniferous forests can be separated provided patches are relatively homogenous but species with similar growth forms for example pine and fir are problematic. Hence there is a gap between what an ecologist would like from remote sensing a map of tree species and what can be delivered a map of forest types. Land cover maps derived from remote sensing often are not detailed enough to improve predictions of species distributions based on ecological niche modelling or similar approaches. In addition land cover classification yields a fairly small number of nominal variables  deciduous forest coniferous forest mixed forest grassland). By contrast climatic and topographic data typically have a greater range of continuous values and are more often used for predicting species distributions. This is especially true across large regions with grossly similar land cover (for example forests in the Amazon Basin). Many animal species do not rely on a single species of plant to define their habitat or the quality of that habitat; birds are thought to respond to vegetation structure in addition to composition particularly at coarse scales and in temperate regions. The structural complexity of vegetation and the relative proportion of cover in the understorey shrub layer and canopy encompass a suite of characteristics (for example nest predation risk abundance and diversity of food resources microclimate) that strongly affect the quality of habitat for nesting and relative nest success. Some of these integrated landscape characteristics can be measured with remote sensing. Derived products such as land cover maps are only one element of a wealth of remote sensing data. Could remote sensing provide information on other landscape characteristics that affect the distribution of animal species? For example even if vegetation composition is unknown could variables such as overall greenness and seasonality be associated with occurrence patterns? Buermann . (2008) explored the latter questions for several species of birds mammals and trees in the Amazon Basin. They found that distribution models that included topographic climatic and remote sensing derived vegetation variables often were more accurate than models that included only topographic and climatic variables. Rather than using a land cover map to model species distribution Buermann . used indices of vegetation and radar scattering data both of which provide a much greater range of continuous data values than vegetation classification alone. This approach may lead to improved models of species distributions if appropriate remote sensing data are selected as input variables. The array of global remote sensing data ranging from surface reflectance to thermal emissivity and of derived products ranging from leaf area index (LAI) to tree cover can be overwhelming. Additional remote sensing data sets with the potential for improving distribution models include topographic data from the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) and precipitation data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM). Here we focus only on remote sensing data specifically related to vegetation. As for any ecological model the most appropriate remote sensing data for models of species distributions will vary taxonomically and geographically but some general information can guide the selection of vegetation variables derived from remote sensing. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) a proxy for photosynthetic activity is commonly used for assessing landscape characteristics. It can be derived from readily available data for example Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) . Other indices such as LAI the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) also relate to overall greenness and productivity. Mean annual NDVI has been shown to correlate with the species richness of birds in a desert ecosystem and may relate to the distributions of individual species. Vegetation phenology derived from NDVI or other vegetation indices may also provide insight into habitat quality. For example the starting date of the growing season derived from time series of NDVI has been used to predict malarial outbreaks in Africa implying a link between mosquito life cycles and changes in NDVI. In another study Osborne . showed that the timing and amplitude of NDVI derived land surface phenology in Spain differed among sites at which Great Bustards (Otis tarda L.) were present or absent suggesting that ecosystem phenology helps to define the species habitat. Time series phenological markers that may prove useful for species distribution modelling include start date and length of the growing season and date of maximum greenness as well as the more commonly used mean maximum and amplitude of NDVI. Another influence on species distributions that cannot be estimated with climate variables alone is land use. For example deforestation reduces the extent and quality of habitat for many species. Data on deforestation can be derived from remote sensing and included in a distribution model. Other GIS based land use layers (for example roads) can also be used to model habitat quality but in areas where human activity is poorly documented remote sensing has particular value. Active radar or lidar measurements provide further potential for measuring structural characteristics of vegetation. Currently lidar data which measure canopy and understory heights based on the strength and timing of the return of a long wavelength laser are not available globally. However Buermann . showed that radar data from QuikSCAT (a sensor initially designed to measure ocean roughness) provided better models of the distributions of bird species than did LAI data. Radar data are sensitive to moisture content and canopy roughness which may be more relevant than LAI to Buermann .s target species and they are also more sensitive than vegetation indices to spatial heterogeneity in forests. A great strength of remote sensingderived vegetation variables as compared with climatic variables is their wide spatial and temporal coverage. Since 1982 global scale 8 km resolution NDVI data have been available as monthly products from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite. Since 2000 global scale 1 km resolution NDVI EVI LAI and fPAR data have been available as bi weekly products from MODIS. Remote locations hundreds of kilometres from a weather station have been imaged repeatedly. Such coverage will never be possible for climatic variables which typically are interpolated from weather station data. Climatic variables derived from remote sensing (for example TRMM) are promising but average climatologies are currently available at coarse resolution only (0.25 for TRMM). In areas with sparse weather stations remote sensing data on vegetation may even provide a better proxy for climate than climate interpolations. Because vegetation data may act as a proxy for climate it can be difficult to determine the extent to which species distributions respond to vegetation structure per se. For example an association between the distribution of a given bird and LAI could imply either that habitat quality is directly affected by vegetation productivity or that habitat quality is a function mainly of climate which affects both birds and vegetation. In this case remote sensing data may identify patterns but observational or manipulative field studies may be necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms. Despite wall to wall coverage remote sensing data are frequently subject to cloud disruption. Many parts of the Earth particularly the tropics are extensively cloud covered making it difficult to derive average greenness estimates and phenological markers. Active sensors including radar penetrate cloud cover more reliably. If cloud contamination is known remote sensing metrics that reduce cloud impact such as annual maximum NDVI can also be used. Furthermore time series interpolation techniques such as Gaussian or spline based curve fits reduce the impact of clouds and temporal averaging can minimize cloud error. However the inclusion of cloud prone data in a species distribution model may add more noise than signal. A final challenge lies in the interpretation of remote sensing data. Understanding the ecological importance of vegetation greenness on quality of habitat for a given species is straightforward but interpreting the influence of for example radar scattering on habitat quality is more difficult. Radar data may be related to canopy roughness moisture level and biomass but the link between the remote sensing product and habitat quality is indirect. The trade off of an improved species distribution model may be reduced ecological meaning. Remote sensing data on vegetation are intriguing complements to climatic and topographic variables for species distribution modeling. Although land cover classifications derived from remote sensing are of limited use for distribution models remotely sensed time series for other attributes of vegetation could add another dimension of information. Vegetation structure productivity and phenology may influence the quality of habitat for some species to the same extent as temperature and precipitation. Creative approaches inclusive of multiple data sources can only improve future species distribution modeling efforts. 1237:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A growing body of research has used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for productivity to predict species richness. Yet the mechanisms that produce the relationship between NDVI and species richness remain unclear because of correlated biotic and abiotic factors that influence NDVI. In this study we investigated different biotic and abiotic effects that potentially drive plant species richnessproductivity relationships. Hawaiian Islands USA. We quantified woody plant species richness structure (density basal area and canopy height) and species composition along a precipitation gradient of 14 Hawaiian dry forest plots. We then used structural equation models combined with 10 years of satellite data to disentangle the effects of precipitation structure and NDVI estimated productivity on species richness. Underlying the simple correlation between NDVI and species richness was the indirect effect of precipitation and direct effect of forest structure. The best fit model showed there was no direct effect of NDVI on species richness. Our results demonstrate that complex relationships drive simple correlations between species richness and productivity. Considering the mechanisms and underlying factors driving NDVIspecies richness relationships could improve predictions of species diversity as satellite measures of productivity have an increasingly important role in habitat mapping species distribution modelling and predictions for global change. 1239:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Increasing geographical range and density of conifers is a major form of land cover change in the western United States affecting fire frequency biogeochemistry and possibly biodiversity. However the extent and magnitude of the change are uncertain. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between changing conifer cover and topography. The central Great Basin in the state of Nevada USA. We used a series of Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1986 1995 and 2005 to map change in pinyon juniper woodlands (Pinus monophylla Juniperus spp.) in the montane central Great Basin of Nevada. We derived fractional greenness for each year using spectral mixture analysis and identified all areas with an above average increase in greenness from 1986 to 1995 and 1995 to 2005. Areas with high fractional greenness in 2005 were most likely to occur at elevations between 2200 and 2600 m a.s.l. Increases in fractional greenness between 1986 and 2005 were most likely to occur at elevations below 2000 m a.s.l. and on south facing slopes. However relationships between elevation and increasing greenness for individual mountain ranges varied considerably from the average trend. Fractional greenness values measured by Landsat suggest that the majority of pinyon juniper woodlands have not reached their maximum potential tree cover. Expansion of pinyon juniper at low elevations and on south facing slopes probably reflects increasing precipitation in the 20th century higher water use efficiency caused by increasing atmospheric CO2 in the late 20th century and livestock grazing at the interface between shrubland and woodland. Identification of the spatial relationships between changing fractional greenness of pinyon juniper woodland and topography can inform regional land management and improve projections of long term ecosystem change. 1251:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pollen data have been used to construct biome maps for today 6000 C 14 yr BP and 18 000 C 14 pr BY for Canada and the eastern United States. The inferred modern biome distributions agree well with independent reconstructions of North American vegetation prior to European settlement. Some discrepancies between the pollen data and the modem potential vegetation are caused by post settlement clearing of the landscape and the consequent increase of herbaceous types in the recent pollen record. Biome distributions at 6000 C 14 yr BP reflected the warmer and drier conditions then prevalent in the continental interior but the overall position of biomes was similar to that of today. The boreal treeline in North America was not significantly north of its present position in contrast to the 100 200 km shift reported for Siberia. At the last glacial maximum (18 000 C 14 yr BP) steppe and tundra were prevalent in the Midwest and northwestern Canada and coniferous forests and woodlands grew in eastern North America. The open vegetation at 18 000 C 14 yr BP was probably due to drier conditions and or lower concentrations of atmospheric CO2. The composition and physical structure of biomes is not constant over time. Mid Holocene biomes were similar in structure to those of today but shifts in the relative importance of individual plant functional types are large enough that the physical properties of biomes such as albedo canopy conductance and surface roughness are likely to have varied even during the Holocene. Last glacial maximum biomes were structurally different from their modern counterparts. The biome maps therefore may obscure significant vegetational changes in space and time during the late Quaternary. The difference between the highest and next highest affinity scores for each sample measures how strongly affinity scores discriminate among biomes. For many biomes the difference is not large and affinity score ties are not uncommon highlighting the importance of tie break procedures when using the biomization method. 1252:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The objective biomization method developed by Prentice ef al. (1996) for Europe was extended using modern pollen samples from Beringia and then applied to fossil pollen data to reconstruct palaeovegetation patterns at 6000 and 18 000 C 14 yr sp. The predicted modern distribution of tundra taiga and cool conifer forests in Alaska and north western Canada generally corresponds well to actual vegetation patterns although sites in regions characterized today by a mosaic of forest and tundra vegetation tend to be preferentially assigned to tundra. Siberian larch forests are delimited less well probably due to the extreme under representation of Larix in pollen spectra. The biome distribution across Beringia at 6000 C 14 yr sp was broadly similar to today with little change in the northern forest limit except for a possible northward advance in the Mackenzie delta region. The western forest limit in Alaska was probably east of its modern position. At 18 000 C 14 yr sr the whole of Beringia was covered by tundra. However; the importance of the various plant functional types varied from site to site supporting the idea that the vegetation cover was a mosaic of different tundra types. 1254:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial and temporal patterns of variability in spring onset are identified across western North America using a spring index (SI) model based on weather station minimum and maximum temperatures (T(min) and T(max) respectively). Principal component analysis shows that two significant and independent patterns explain roughly half of the total variance in the timing of spring onset from 1920 to 2005. However these patterns of spring onset do not appear to be linear responses to the primary modes of variability in the Northern Hemisphere: the Pacific North American pattern (PNA) and the northern annular mode (NAM). Instead over the period when reanalysis data and the spring index model overlap (1950 2005) the patterns of spring onset are local responses to the state of both the PNA and NAM which together modulate the onset date of spring by 10 20 days on interannual time scales. They do so by controlling the number and intensity of warm days. There is also a regionwide trend in spring advancement of about 1.5 days decade( 1) from 1950 to 2005. Trends in the NAM and PNA can only explain about one third ( 0.5 day decade( 1)) of this trend. 1267:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phenological events defined points in the life cycle of a plant or animal have been regarded as highly plastic traits reflecting flexible responses to various environmental cues. The ability of a species to track via shifts in phenological events the abiotic environment through time might dictate its vulnerability to future climate change. Understanding the predictors and drivers of phenological change is therefore critical. Here we evaluated evidence for phylogenetic conservatism the tendency for closely related species to share similar ecological and biological attributes in phenological traits across flowering plants. We aggregated published and unpublished data on timing of first flower and first leaf encompassing 4000 species at 23 sites across the Northern Hemisphere. We reconstructed the phylogeny for the set of included species first using the software program Phylomatic and second from DNA data. We then quantified phylogenetic conservatism in plant phenology within and across sites. We show that more closely related species tend to flower and leaf at similar times. By contrasting mean flowering times within and across sites however we illustrate that it is not the time of year that is conserved but rather the phenological responses to a common set of abiotic cues. Our findings suggest that species cannot be treated as statistically independent when modelling phenological responses.Synthesis. Closely related species tend to resemble each other in the timing of their life history events a likely product of evolutionarily conserved responses to environmental cues. The search for the underlying drivers of phenology must therefore account for species shared evolutionary histories. 1273:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Studying the energetics of marine top predators such as seabirds is essential to understand processes underlying adult winter survival and its impact on population dynamics. Winter survival is believed to be the single most important life history trait in long lived species but its determinants are largely unknown. Seabirds are inaccessible during this season so conventional metabolic studies are extremely challenging and new approaches are needed. This paper describes and uses a state of the art mechanistic model Niche Mapper (TM) to predict energy expenditure and food requirements of the two main seabird species wintering in the northwest Atlantic. We found that energy demand increased throughout the winter phase in both species. Across this period mean estimated daily energy requirements were 1306 kJ day( 1) for Brunnichs guillemots (Uria lomvia) and 430 kJ day( 1) for little auks (Alle alle) wintering off Greenland and Newfoundland. Mean estimated daily food requirements were 547 g wet food day( 1) for Brunnichs guillemots and 289 g wet food day( 1) for little auks. For both species and both wintering sites our model predicts a sharp increase in energy expenditure between November and December primarily driven by climatic factors such as air temperature and wind speed. These findings strongly suggest the existence of an energetic bottleneck for North Atlantic seabirds towards the end of the year a challenging energetic phase which might explain recurrent events of winter mass mortality so called seabird winter wrecks. Our study therefore emphasizes the relevance of thermodynamics biophysical modelling for investigating the energy balance of wintering marine top predators and its interplay with survival and population dynamics in the context of global change. 1285:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Accurate representation of surface energy partitioning is crucial for studying land surface processes and the climatic influence of land cover and land use change using coupled climate land surface models. A critical question for these models especially for newly coupled ones is whether they can adequately distinguish differences in surface energy partitioning among different vegetation types. We evaluated 3 years (2004 2006) of surface energy partitioning and surface climate over four dominant vegetation types (cropland grassland needleleaf evergreen forest and broadleaf deciduous forest) across the United States in a recently coupled regional climate model Weather Research and Forecasting Model 3 Community Land Model 3.5 (WRF3 CLM3.5) by comparing model output to observations (AmeriFlux Clouds and the Earths Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Parameter elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data) and to standard WRF model output. We found that WRF3 CLM3.5 can capture the seasonal pattern in energy partitioning for needleleaf evergreen forest but needs improvements in cropland grassland and broadleaf deciduous forest. Correcting the leaf area index representation for cropland and grassland could immediately improve the simulation of latent heat flux and hence the energy partitioning. Adding an irrigation scheme is especially important for cropland in the Midwest where the strongly coupled soil moisture and precipitation can form a positive feedback that reduces latent heat flux and increases the warm bias. For deciduous forest the simulated excess latent heat flux before leaf emergence is mainly from soil evaporation requiring further improvement in the soil evaporation scheme. Finally the domain wide overestimated net radiation contributes to positive biases in sensible latent and ground heat flux as well as surface temperature. The standard WRF simulation has a similar warm bias implicating errors in modules other than the land surface code. A sensitivity test suggests that improved simulation of downward solar radiation could reduce the energy flux and temperature biases. After adding irrigation process and correcting the leaf area index WRF3 CLM3.5 appears reliable for studying conversions between natural grassland and irrigated cropland and between needleleaf evergreen forest and grassland. 1286:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Energy fluxes across the surface of lakes regulate heat storage and affect the water balance. Sensible and latent heat fluxes are affected by atmospheric stability especially for large lakes. We examined the effect of atmospheric stability on the heat fluxes on seasonal time scales at Lake Tanganyika East Africa by estimating hourly sensible and latent heat fluxes and net radiation using thermistor chains and meteorological stations. The atmosphere was almost always unstable in contrast to the atmosphere above North American Great Lakes which is unstable in winter and stable in summer. Persistent atmospheric instability resulted in a 13 PeRcEnT and 18 PeRcEnT increase in the annual mean heat loss by latent and sensible heat fluxes respectively relative to conditions of neutral stability. The persistent unstable atmosphere is caused by a higher water surface temperature compared with air temperature which we argue is the case in general in (sub) tropical lakes. Low humidity further enhanced the frequency of unstable conditions and enhanced the exchange of heat and vapor from the lake to the atmosphere. The estimated heat fluxes were sensitive to the temporal scale of data inputs and to the local values of parameters such as air density. To our knowledge this is the first paper that demonstrates and quantifies the effect of atmospheric stability on latent and sensible heat fluxes from a lake on an annual basis using data collected from the lake surface. 1287:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spaceborne measurements by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS Aqua satellite provide a global view of the methane (CH4) distribution in the mid upper troposphere (MUT CH4). The focus of this study is to examine the spatiotemporal variation of MUT CH4 in the high Northern Hemisphere (HNH) using AIRS retrievals aircraft measurements and simulations from a forward chemistry transport model  ACTM). Data from 2004 and 2005 focusing over two regions (Alaska and Siberia) are analyzed. An important feature in the seasonal variation of CH4 we found is the summer increase of MUT CH4 which is nearly opposite to the summer minimum of CH4 in the marine boundary layer (MBL). This study also demonstrated an apparent increase of CH4 over Alaska associated with the 2004 Alaska forest fire and a negative bias of the ACTM simulations in the HNH. The larger bias of the model simulations in the late winter to early spring may indicate possible unidentified CH4 emission sources (e. g. the use of energy or gas leakage) during this period but more studies will be needed due to the retrieval uncertainties in the polar winter season. The summer increase of MUT CH4 is related to surface emission but the enhanced convection in summer is likely the most important driver. 1301:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A typical flood frequency analysis is based on gauged annual maximum discharges. One assumption behind the analysis is that the measured discharge signal is stationary. The validity of this assumption can be difficult to establish particularly where urbanization has occurred within the gauged watershed altering the response of the affected watershed to precipitation. This alteration can produce a nonstationary streamflow signal that can be significant depending on the percentage of the watershed altered. As urbanization increases peak discharges are shown to increase producing a positive trend in the annual maximum series. Urbanization occurring during and or after the gauging period is quantified using spatially and temporally distributed land use data. Three statistical tests (a parametric t test on the slope of the linear relationship between the flood series and time and two nonparametric tests: the Kendalls Tau and the Spearman Rank Correlation) are performed on both the annual maximum discharge and annual maximum discharge precipitation ratios series to test for trends or nonstationary signals corresponding to periods of urbanization. A case study suggests that the ratios are more effective than the discharges alone for identifying nonstationarity resulting from urbanization. In addition relationships between measures of urbanization and the presence or absence of significant trends in the discharge series are presented. 1319:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In shallow lakes environmental warming and nutrient loading are important influences on the likelihood of a shift between clear and turbid ecosystem states. With temperatures and nutrient runoff predicted to increase within the next decades climate change poses a threat to lake communities. However current predictions on the effect of these environmental factors on the abundance and timing of peak zooplankton numbers are based on correlations rather than on experimental isolation of thermal from other confounding effects. We present results of warming (4 degrees C above ambient) and increased nutrient loading on plankton communities in 48 outdoor mesocosms simulating fishless and hypertrophic ponds. The timing of the chlorophyll a peak and crustacean zooplankton peak abundance dominated by Daphnia pulex responded strongly to temperature and nutrient addition. Daphnia numbers reached peaks 22 24 days earlier in heated than in unheated mesocosms. The chlorophyll a peak abundance advanced by 15 19 days with heating. Phytoplankton total zooplankton and D. pulex reached peak abundance 12 19 days later when doses of nitrogen and phosphorus were added; this finding contradicts predicted earlier phytoplankton and zooplankton spring peak abundances with nutrient enrichment. Peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances did not differ with temperature treatment contrary to our expectations but peak abundances occurred at similar actual temperatures. Nutrient additions had no effect on the peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances in our mesocosms. Overall climate warming is likely to advance plankton phenology in fishless ponds; however this advance could be dampened in systems with high nutrient concentration. We found very high zooplankton abundances with warming and high nutrient loadings inducing a clear water state in all our tanks owing to heavy zooplankton grazing despite high nutrient concentrations. 1354:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many studies of mammalian herbivores have employed remotely sensed vegetation greenness in the form of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for forage quality. The assumption that reflected greenness represents forage quality often goes untested and limited data exist on the relationships between remotely sensed and traditional forage nutrient indicators. We provide the first study connecting NDVI and forage nutrient indicators within a free ranging African herbivore ecosystem. We examined the relationships between fecal nutrient levels (nitrogen and phosphorus) forage nutrient levels body condition and NDVI for African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in a South African savanna ecosystem over a 2 year period (2001 and 2002). We used an information theoretic approach to rank models of fecal nitrogen (Nf) and phosphorus (Pf) as functions of geology season and NDVI in each year separately. For each year the highest ranked models for Nf accounted for 61 PeRcEnT and 65 PeRcEnT of the observed variance and these models included geology season and NDVI. The top ranked model for Pf in 2001 although capturing 54 PeRcEnT of the variability did not include NDVI. In 2002 we could not identify a top ranking model for phosphorus  all models were within 2 AICc of each other). Body condition was most highly correlated (R adj(2) equals 0.75; P   0.001) with NDVI at a 1 month time lag and with N f at a 3 months time lag (R adj(2) equals 0.65; P   0.001) but was not significantly correlated with P f. Our findings suggest that NDVI can be used to index nitrogen content of forage and is correlated with improved body condition in African buffalo. Thus NDVI provides a useful means to assess forage quality where crude protein is a limiting resource. We found that NDVI accounted for more than a seasonal effect and in a system where standing biomass may be high but of low quality understanding available nutrients is useful for management. . 1366:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Regional climate change induced by rapid urbanization is responsible for and may result from changes in coupled human ecological systems. Specifically the distribution of urban vegetation may be an important intermediary between patterns of human settlement and regional climate spatial variability. To test this hypothesis we identified the relationships between surface temperature one component of regional climate vegetation and human settlement patterns in the Phoenix AZ USA region. Combining satellite derived surface temperature and vegetation data from an early summer day with US Census and topographic data we found substantial surface temperature differences within the city that correlate primarily with an index of vegetation cover. Furthermore both of these patterns vary systematically with the social characteristics of neighborhoods through the region. Overall every  DoLlQuAnT 10 000 increase in neighborhood annual median household income was associated with a 0.28 degrees C decrease in surface temperature on an early summer day in Phoenix. Temperature variation within a neighborhood was negatively related to population density. A multivariate model generated using path analysis supports our hypothesis that social impacts on surface temperature occur primarily through modifications of vegetation cover. Higher income neighborhoods were associated with increased vegetation cover and higher density neighborhoods were associated with decreased vegetation variability. These results suggest that settlement patterns in the central Arizona region influence regional climate through multiple pathways that are heterogeneously distributed throughout the city. 1368:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of modelled area burned to environmental factors across a range of independently developed landscape fire succession models. The sensitivity of area burned to variation in four factors namely terrain (flat undulating and mountainous) fuel pattern (finely and coarsely clumped) climate (observed warmer and wetter and warmer and drier) and weather (year to year variability) was determined for four existing landscape fire succession models (EMBYR FIRESCAPE LANDSUM and SEM LAND) and a new model implemented in the LAMOS modelling shell (LAMOS(DS)). Sensitivity was measured as the variance in area burned explained by each of the four factors and all of the interactions amongst them in a standard generalised linear modelling analysis. Modelled area burned was most sensitive to climate and variation in weather with four models sensitive to each of these factors and three models sensitive to their interaction. Models generally exhibited a trend of increasing area burned from observed through warmer and wetter to warmer and drier climates with a 23 fold increase in area burned on average from the observed to the warmer drier climate. Area burned was sensitive to terrain for FIRESCAPE and fuel pattern for EMBYR. These results demonstrate that the models are generally more sensitive to variation in climate and weather as compared with terrain complexity and fuel pattern although the sensitivity to these latter factors in a small number of models demonstrates the importance of representing key processes. The models that represented fire ignition and spread in a relatively complex fashion were more sensitive to changes in all four factors because they explicitly simulate the processes that link these factors to area burned. 1369:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A large single year reversal in the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during 1996 led to a dramatic shift in the slope water circulation patterns of the northwest (NW) Atlantic. Analyses of time series data collected from the region over the past half century show that both physical and biological responses are commonly elicited by such phase reversals in the NAO. Here we use a model developed from time series data to predict responses of the NW Atlantic slope water circulation patterns to phase reversals in the NAO. 1371:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate warming over the 20th century has increased the density stratification and stability of Lake Tanganyika a deep rift valley lake. Here we examine the physical processes involved in and affected by the warming of the lake and we discuss effects on lake productivity. The rate of net heat absorption by Lake Tanganyika has been 0.4 W m( 2) since 1913 twice the rate in the global ocean indicating stronger climate forcing in the East African region. Lakes warm through increased incoming long wave radiation. While lakes in general will increase heat outputs in a warming climate heat outputs will increase more slowly in deeper lakes than in shallower lakes. Temperatures have increased by 0.2 degrees C at 1000 m in depth in part because of reduced cool marginal inflows while water surface temperatures have increased by about 1.3 degrees C. This differential heating over depth has increased the density gradient through the water column reducing the potential for vertical mixing and thereby limiting nutrient fluxes to the phototrophic zone. An increase in transparency indicating a reduction in productivity as a result of the reduced vertical mixing occurred both in Lake Tanganyika and in Lake Malawi a similar deep tropical lake in which warming has also been documented. 142:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1455:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Agricultural expansion and climate variability have become important agents of disturbance in the Amazon basin. Recent studies have demonstrated considerable resilience of Amazonian forests to moderate annual drought but they also show that interactions between deforestation fire and drought potentially lead to losses of carbon storage and changes in regional precipitation patterns and river discharge. Although the basin wide impacts of land use and drought may not yet surpass the magnitude of natural variability of hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles there are some signs of a transition to a disturbance dominated regime. These signs include changing energy and water cycles in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon basin. 1462:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change over the past similar to30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species(1 2) and has been implicated in one species level extinction(3). Using projections of species distributions for future climate scenarios we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20 PeRcEnT of the Earths terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a powerlaw relationship with geographical range size we predict on the basis of mid range climate warming scenarios for 2050 that 15 37 PeRcEnT of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be committed to extinction. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken minimal climate warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (similar to18 PeRcEnT) than mid range (similar to24 PeRcEnT) and maximum change (similar to35 PeRcEnT) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration. 1472:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mean global temperatures have risen this century and further warming is predicted to continue for the next 50 100 years(1 3) Some migratory species can respond rapidly to yearly climate variation by altering the timing or destination of migration(4) but most wildlife is sedentary and so is incapable of such a rapid response. For these species responses to the warming trend should be slower reflected in poleward shifts of the range. Such changes in distribution would occur at the level of the population stemming not from changes in the pattern of individuals movements but from changes in the ratios of extinctions to colonizations at the northern and southern boundaries of the range. A northward range shift therefore occurs when there is net extinction at the southern boundary or net colonization at the northern boundary. However previous evidence has been limited to a single species or to only a portion of the species range(6 7). Here we provide the first large scale evidence of poleward shifts in entire species ranges. In a sample of 35 non migratory European butterflies 63 PeRcEnT have ranges that have shifted to the north by 35 240 km during this century and only 3 PeRcEnT have shifted to the south. 147:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1486:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Warming experiments are increasingly relied on to estimate plant responses to global climate change. For experiments to provide meaningful predictions of future responses they should reflect the empirical record of responses to temperature variability and recent warming including advances in the timing of flowering and leafing. We compared phenology (the timing of recurring life history events) in observational studies and warming experiments spanning four continents and 1 634 plant species using a common measure of temperature sensitivity (change in days per degree Celsius). We show that warming experiments underpredict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing by 8.5 fold and 4.0 fold respectively compared with long term observations. For species that were common to both study types the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations however could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re evaluated. 1487:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Water availability limits plant growth and production in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. However biomes differ substantially in sensitivity of aboveground net primary production ( ANPP) to between year variation in precipitation. Average rain use efficiency ( RUE; ANPP precipitation) also varies between biomes supposedly because of differences in vegetation structure and or biogeochemical constraints. Here we show that RUE decreases across biomes as mean annual precipitation increases. However during the driest years at each site there is convergence to a common maximum RUE (RUEmax) that is typical of arid ecosystems. RUEmax was also identified by experimentally altering the degree of limitation by water and other resources. Thus in years when water is most limiting deserts grasslands and forests all exhibit the same rate of biomass production per unit rainfall despite differences in physiognomy and site level RUE. Global climate models predict increased between year variability in precipitation more frequent extreme drought events and changes in temperature. Forecasts of future ecosystem behaviour should take into account this convergent feature of terrestrial biomes. 1488:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change is predicted to alter global species diversity the distribution of human pathogens and ecosystem services. Forecasting these changes and designing adequate management of future ecosystem services will require predictive models encompassing the most fundamental biotic responses. However most present models omit important processes such as evolution and competition. Here we develop a spatially explicit eco evolutionary model of multi species responses to climate change. We demonstrate that both dispersal and evolution differentially mediate extinction risks and biodiversity alterations through time and across climate gradients. Together high genetic variance and low dispersal best minimized extinction risks. Surprisingly high dispersal did not reduce extinctions because the shifting ranges of some species hastened the decline of others. Evolutionary responses dominated during the later stages of climatic changes and in hot regions. No extinctions occurred without competition which highlights the importance of including species interactions in global biodiversity models. Most notably climate change created extinction and evolutionary debts with changes in species richness and traits occuring long after climate stabilization. Therefore even if we halt anthropogenic climate change today transient eco evolutionary dynamics would ensure centuries of additional alterations in global biodiversity. 1489:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Past meta analyses of the response of marine organisms to climate change have examined a limited range of locations taxonomic groups and or biological responses. This has precluded a robust overview of the effect of climate change in the global ocean. Here we synthesized all available studies of the consistency of marine ecological observations with expectations under climate change. This yielded a meta database of 1 735 marine biological responses for which either regional or global climate change was considered as a driver. Included were instances of marine taxa responding as expected in a manner inconsistent with expectations and taxa demonstrating no response. From this database 81 83 PeRcEnT of all observations for distribution phenology community composition abundance demography and calcification across taxa and ocean basins were consistent with the expected impacts of climate change. Of the species responding to climate change rates of distribution shifts were on average consistent with those required to track ocean surface temperature changes. Conversely we did not find a relationship between regional shifts in spring phenology and the seasonality of temperature. Rates of observed shifts in species distributions and phenology are comparable to or greater than those for terrestrial systems. 148:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1490:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tropical forests are incredibly dynamic showing rapid and longer term changes in growth mortality and net primary productivity. Tropical species may be highly sensitive to temperature increases associated with climate change because of their narrow thermal tolerances. However at the ecosystem scale the competing effects of temperature light and precipitation on tropical forest productivity have been difficult to assess. Here we quantify cloudiness over the past several decades to investigate how clouds together with temperature and precipitation affect flower production in two contrasting tropical forests. Our results show that temperature rather than clouds is critically important to tropical forest flower production. Warmer temperatures increased flower production over seasonal interannual and longer timescales contrary to recent evidence that some tropical forests are already near their temperature threshold. Clouds were primarily important seasonally and limited production in a seasonally dry forest but enhanced production in an ever wet forest. A long term increase in flower production at the seasonally dry forest is not driven by clouds and instead may be tied to increasing temperatures. These relationships show that tropical forest productivity which is not widely thought to be controlled by temperature is indeed sensitive to small temperature changes (1 4 degrees C) across multiple timescales. 1504:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions is predicted to raise the mean global temperature by 1.0 3.5 degrees C in the next 50 100 years. The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of Ecosystem Warming Studies the goals of which are to integrate and foster research on ecosystem level effects of rising temperature. In this paper we use meta analysis to synthesize data on the response of soil respiration net N mineralization and aboveground plant productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites representing four broadly defined biomes including high (latitude or altitude) tundra low tundra grassland and forest. Warming methods included electrical heat resistance ground cables greenhouses vented and unvented field chambers overhead infrared lamps and passive nighttime warming. Although results from individual sites showed considerable variation in response to warming results from the meta analysis showed that across all sites and years 2 9 years of experimental warming in the range 0.3 6.0 degrees C significantly increased soil respiration rates by 20 PeRcEnT (with a 95 PeRcEnT confidence interval of 18 22 PeRcEnT) net N mineralization rates by 46 PeRcEnT (with a 95 PeRcEnT confidence interval of 30 64 PeRcEnT). and plant productivity by 19 PeRcEnT (with a 95 PeRcEnT confidence interval of 15 23 PeRcEnT). The response of soil respiration to warming was generally larger in forested ecosystems compared to low tundra and grassland ecosystems and the response of plant productivity was generally larger in low tundra ecosystems than in forest and grassland ecosystems. With the exception of aboveground plant productivity which showed a greater positive response to warming in colder ecosystems the magnitude of the response of these three processes to experimental warming was not generally significantly related to the geographic climatic or environmental variables evaluated in this analysis. This underscores the need to understand the relative importance of specific factors (such as temperature moisture site quality vegetation type successional status land use history etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales and suggests that we should be cautious in   scaling up   responses from the plot and site level to the landscape and biome level. Overall ecosystem warming experiments are shown to provide valuable insights on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to elevated temperature. 150:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Shifts in phenology and distribution in response to both recent and paleontological climate changes vary markedly in both direction and extent among species. These individualistic shifts are inconsistent with common forecasting techniques based on environmental rather than biological niches. What biological details could enhance forecasts? Organismal characteristics such as thermal and hydric limits seasonal timing and duration of the life cycle ecological breadth and dispersal capacity and fitness and evolutionary potential are expected to influence climate change impacts. We review statistical and mechanistic approaches for incorporating traits in predictive models as well as the potential to use phylogeny as a proxy for traits. Traits generally account for a significant but modest fraction of the variation in phenological and range shifts. Further assembly of phenotypic and phylogenetic data coupled with the development of mechanistic approaches is essential to improved forecasts of the ecological consequences of climate change. 1557:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The most highly cited ecologists and environmental scientists provide both a benchmark and unique opportunity to consider the importance of research funding. Here we use citation data and self reported funding levels to assess the relative importance of various factors in shaping productivity and potential impact. The elite were senior Americans well funded with large labs. In contrast to Canadian NSERC grant holders (not in the top 1 PeRcEnT) citations per paper did not increase with higher levels of funding within the ecological elite. We propose that this is good news for several reasons. It suggests that the publications generated by the top ecologists and environmental scientists are subject to limitations that higher volume of publications is always important and that increased funding to ecologists in general can shift our discipline to wider research networks. As expected collaboration was identified as an important factor for the elite and hopefully this serves as a positive incentive to funding agencies since it increases the visibility of their research. 1576:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The horse subfamily Equinae underwent a major radiation during the Miocene in North America diversifying from one species Parahippus leonensis to 70 species. This radiation has been linked to climatic and vegetation changes that occurred in North America during this time. However the relationship between climate change and speciation has not previously been studied quantitatively using phylogenetic biogeography. Distribution and age range data were collected for all North American species within eighteen equine genera through a literature review and use of the Paleobiology Database. Fitch parsimony analysis of the taxon area claclogram indicate that speciation by dispersal (Allopatry model II) was more common in the evolution of the clade than speciation by vicariance (Allopatry model I). Distribution data were analyzed using the Lieberman modified Brooks Parsimony Analysis (LBPA) to determine patterns of vicariance and geodispersal using four constrained biogeographic regions within North America in the analysis: the Great Plains the Southwest the Gulf Coast and the Southeast. Resulting general area cladograms are congruent with geological events such as uplift of the Rocky Mountains and climatic conditions such as the change from a warm and moist to cool and and climate during the Miocene. Well supported vicariance and geodispersal trees derived from the LBPA analysis are largely congruent with each other indicating that cyclical events in particular climate change during the Miocene influenced the radiation of the clade. 1650:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The rapidly warming temperatures in high latitude and alpine regions have the potential to alter the phenology of Arctic and alpine plants affecting processes ranging from food webs to ecosystem trace gas fluxes. The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was initiated in 1990 to evaluate the effects of expected rapid changes in temperature on tundra plant phenology growth and community changes using experimental warming. Here we used the ITEX control data to test the phenological responses to background temperature variation across sites spanning latitudinal and moisture gradients. The dataset overall did not show an advance in phenology; instead temperature variability during the years sampled and an absence of warming at some sites resulted in mixed responses. Phenological transitions of high Arctic plants clearly occurred at lower heat sum thresholds than those of low Arctic and alpine plants. However sensitivity to temperature change was similar among plants from the different climate zones. Plants of different communities and growth forms differed for some phenological responses. Heat sums associated with flowering and greening appear to have increased over time. These results point to a complex suite of changes in plant communities and ecosystem function in high latitudes and elevations as the climate warms. 1658:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We assessed the effects of landscape features (vegetation type and topography) season and spatial hierarchy on the nutrient content of surface soils in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico. Considerable spatial variation characterized the soils of the LEF and differences between replicate sites within each combination of vegetation type (tabonuco vs. palo colorado vs. dwarf vs. pasture) and topographic position (ridge vs valley) accounted for 11 60 PeRcEnT of the total variation in soil properties. Nevertheless mean soil properties differed significantly among vegetation types between topographic positions and between seasons (wet vs dry). Differences among vegetation types reflected soil properties (e. g. bulk density soil moisture Na P C N S) that typically are related to biological processes and inputs of water. In forests differences between topographic positions reflected elements  Ca Mg K and Al) that typically are associated with geochemical processes; however the nutrients and elements responsible for topographic differences in dwarf forest were different from those in other forest types. In pastures differences between topographic positions were associated with the same soil properties responsible for differences among the other vegetation types. Pastures also had reduced N levels and different soil characteristics compared to undisturbed tabonuco forest. The only soil parameter that differed significantly between seasons was soil moisture. Soils of the LEF do not support the contention that N becomes limiting with an increase in elevation and suggest that absolute pool sizes of N and P are not responsible for the reduction in productivity with elevation. 1699:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large scale climate change is superimposed on interacting patterns of climate variability that fluctuate on numerous temporal and spatial scales elements of which such as seasonal timing may have important impacts on local and regional ecosystem forcing. Lake Baikal in Siberia is not only the worlds largest and most biologically diverse lake but it has exceptionally strong seasonal structure in ecosystem dynamics that may be dramatically affected by fluctuations in seasonal timing. We applied time frequency analysis to a near continuous 58 year record of water temperature from Lake Baikal to examine how seasonality in the lake has fluctuated over the past half century and to infer underlying mechanisms. On decadal scales the timing of seasonal onset strongly corresponds with deviation in the zonal wind intensity as described by length of day (LOD); on shorter scales these temperature patterns shift in concert with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Importantly the connection between ENSO and Lake Baikal is gated by the cool and warm periods of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Large scale climatic phenomena affecting Siberia are apparent in Lake Baikal surface water temperature data dynamics resulting from jet stream and storm track variability in central Asia and across the Northern Hemisphere. 169:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1705:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantifying local peoples perceptions to climate change and their assessments of which changes matter is fundamental to addressing the dual challenge of land conservation and poverty alleviation in densely populated tropical regions To develop appropriate policies and responses it will be important not only to anticipate the nature of expected changes but also how they are perceived interpreted and adapted to by local residents. The Albertine Rift region in East Africa is one of the worlds most threatened biodiversity hotspots due to dense smallholder agriculture high levels of land and resource pressures and habitat loss and conversion. Results of three separate household surveys conducted in the vicinity of Kibale National Park during the late 2000s indicate that farmers are concerned with variable precipitation. Many survey respondents reported that conditions are drier and rainfall timing is becoming less predictable. Analysis of daily rainfall data for the climate normal period 1981 to 2010 indicates that total rainfall both within and across seasons has not changed significantly although the timing and transitions of seasons has been highly variable. Results of rainfall data analysis also indicate significant changes in the intra seasonal rainfall distribution including longer dry periods within rainy seasons which may contribute to the perceived decrease in rainfall and can compromise food security. Our results highlight the need for fine scale climate information to assist agro ecological communities in developing effective adaptive management. 1720:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A key challenge in ecology is to define species niches on the basis of functional traits. Size and shape are important determinants of a species niche but their causal role is often difficult to interpret. For endotherms size and shape define the thermal niche through their interaction with core temperature insulation and environmental conditions determining the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) where energy and water costs are minimized. Laboratory measures of metabolic rate used to describe TNZs cannot be generalized to infer the capacity for terrestrial animals to find their TNZ in complex natural environments. Here we derive an analytical model of the thermal niche of an ellipsoid furred endotherm that accurately predicts field and laboratory data. We use the model to illustrate the relative importance of size and shape on the location of the TNZ under different environmental conditions. The interaction between body shape and posture strongly influences the location of the TNZ and the expected scaling of metabolic rate with size at constant temperature. We demonstrate that the latter relationship has a slope of approximately 1 2 rather than the commonly expected surface area volume scaling of 2 3. We show how such functional traits models can be integrated with spatial environmental datasets to calculate null expectations for body size clines from a thermal perspective aiding mechanistic interpretation of empirical clines such as Bergmanns Rule. The combination of spatially explicit data with biophysical models of heat exchange provides a powerful means for studying the thermal niches of endotherms across climatic gradients. 1723:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Analyses of datasets throughout the temperate midlatitude regions show a widespread tendency for species to advance their springtime phenology consistent with warming trends over the past 20 50 y. Within these general trends toward earlier spring however are species that either have insignificant trends or have delayed their timing. Various explanations have been offered to explain this apparent nonresponsiveness to warming including the influence of other abiotic cues (e. g. photoperiod) or reductions in fall winter chilling (vernalization). Few studies however have explicitly attributed the historical trends of nonresponding species to any specific factor. Here we analyzed long term data on phenology and seasonal temperatures from 490 species on two continents and demonstrate that (i) apparent nonresponders are indeed responding to warming but their responses to fall winter and spring warming are opposite in sign and of similar magnitude; (ii) observed trends in first flowering date depend strongly on the magnitude of a given species response to fall winter vs. spring warming; and (iii) inclusion of fall winter temperature cues strongly improves hindcast model predictions of long term flowering trends compared with models with spring warming only. With a few notable exceptions climate change research has focused on the overall mean trend toward phenological advance minimizing discussion of apparently nonresponding species. Our results illuminate an understudied source of complexity in wild species responses and support the need for models incorporating diverse environmental cues to improve predictability of community level responses to anthropogenic climate change. 1740:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Increasing concern about the impacts of global warming on biodiversity has stimulated extensive discussion but methods to translate broad scale shifts in climate into direct impacts on living animals remain simplistic. A key missing element from models of climatic change impacts on animals is the buffering influence of behavioral thermoregulation. Here we show how behavioral and mass energy balance models can be combined with spatial data on climate topography and vegetation to predict impacts of increased air temperature on thermoregulating ectotherms such as reptiles and insects (a large portion of global biodiversity). We show that for most   cold blooded terrestrial animals the primary thermal challenge is not to attain high body temperatures (although this is important in temperate environments) but to stay cool (particularly in tropical and desert areas where ectotherm biodiversity is greatest). The impact of climate warming on thermoregulating ectotherms will depend critically on how changes in vegetation cover alter the availability of shade as well as the animals capacities to alter their seasonal timing of activity and reproduction. Warmer environments also may increase maintenance energy costs while simultaneously constraining activity time putting pressure on mass and energy budgets. Energy and mass balance models provide a general method to integrate the complexity of these direct interactions between organisms and climate into spatial predictions of the impact of climate change on biodiversity. This methodology allows quantitative organism and habitat specific assessments of climate change impacts. 1751:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Monarch butterflies overwinter in restricted areas in montane oyamel fir forests in central Mexico with specific microclimates that allow the butterflies to survive for up to 5 months. We use ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify areas adequate for overwintering monarch colonies under both current and future climate scenarios. The ENM approach permits testing and validation of model predictivity and yields quantitative testable predictions regarding likely future climate change effects. Our models predicted monarch presence with a high degree of accuracy and indicated that precipitation and diurnal temperature range were key environmental factors in making locations suitable for monarchs. When we projected monarch distribution onto future climate scenarios (Hadley Centre climate models) we found that conditions were likely to be inadequate across the entire current winter range particularly owing to increased cool weather precipitation that could cause increased mortality. This study applies ENM to understanding the seasonal dynamics of a migratory species under climate change and uses ENM to identify key limiting environmental parameters in species responses to climate change. 1761:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent global warming is acting across marine freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems to favor species adapted to warmer conditions and or reduce the abundance of cold adapted organisms    thermophilization   of communities). Lack of community responses to increased temperature however has also been reported for several taxa and regions suggesting that   climatic lags   may be frequent. Here we show that microclimatic effects brought about by forest canopy closure can buffer biotic responses to macroclimate warming thus explaining an apparent climatic lag. Using data from 1 409 vegetation plots in European and North American temperate forests each surveyed at least twice over an interval of 12 67 y we document significant thermophilization of ground layer plant communities. These changes reflect concurrent declines in species adapted to cooler conditions and increases in species adapted to warmer conditions. However thermophilization particularly the increase of warm adapted species is attenuated in forests whose canopies have become denser probably reflecting cooler growing season ground temperatures via increased shading. As standing stocks of trees have increased in many temperate forests in recent decades local microclimatic effects may commonly be moderating the impacts of macroclimate warming on forest understories. Conversely increases in harvesting woody biomass for bioenergy may open forest canopies and accelerate thermophilization of temperate forest biodiversity. 1766:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Temperature controls the rate of fundamental biochemical processes and thereby regulates organismal attributes including development rate and survival. The increase in metabolic rate with temperature explains substantial among species variation in life history traits population dynamics and ecosystem processes. Temperature can also cause variability in metabolic rate within species. Here we compare the effect of temperature on a key component of marine life cycles among a geographically and taxonomically diverse group of marine fish and invertebrates. Although innumerable lab studies document the negative effect of temperature on larval development time little is known about the generality versus taxon dependence of this relationship. We present a unified parameterized model for the temperature dependence of larval development in marine animals. Because the duration of the larval period is known to influence larval dispersal distance and survival changes in ocean temperature could have a direct and predictable influence on population connectivity community structure and regional to global scale patterns of biodiversity. 1798:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, How will climate change affect species reproduction and subsequent survival? In many egg laying reptiles the sex of offspring is determined by the temperature experienced during a critical period of embryonic development (temperature dependent sex determination TSD). Increasing air temperatures are likely to skew offspring sex ratios in the absence of evolutionary or plastic adaptation hence we urgently require means for predicting the future distributions of species with TSD. Here we develop a mechanistic model that demonstrates how climate soil and topography interact with physiology and nesting behaviour to determine sex ratios of tuatara cold climate reptiles from New Zealand with an unusual developmental biology. Under extreme regional climate change all male clutches would hatch at 100 PeRcEnT of current nest sites of the rarest species Sphenodon guntheri by the mid 2080s. We show that tuatara could behaviourally compensate for the male biasing effects of warmer air temperatures by nesting later in the season or selecting shaded nest sites. Later nesting is however an unlikely response to global warming as many oviparous species are nesting earlier as the climate warms. Our approach allows the assessment of the thermal suitability of current reserves and future translocation sites for tuatara and can be readily modified to predict climatic impacts on any species with TSD. 17:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1832:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Whether movement will enable organisms to alleviate thermal stress is central to the biodiversity implications of climate change. We use the temperature dependence of ectotherm performance to investigate the fitness consequences of movement. Movement to an optimal location within a 50 km radius will only offset the fitness impacts of climate change by 2100 in 5 per cent of locations globally. Random movement carries an 87 per cent risk of further fitness detriment. Mountainous regions with high temperature seasonality  temperate areas) not only offer the greatest benefit from optimal movement but also the most severe fitness consequences if an organism moves to the wrong location. Doubling dispersal capacity would provide modest benefit exclusively to directed dispersers in topographically diverse areas. The benefits of movement for escaping climate change are particularly limited in the tropics where fitness impacts will be most severe. The potential of movement to lessen climate change impacts may have been overestimated. 1833:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, At interannual to multidecadal time scales much of the oceanographic and climatic variability in the North Atlantic Ocean can be associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). While evidence suggests that there is a relationship between the NAO and zooplankton dynamics in the North Atlantic Ocean the phytoplankton response to NAO induced changes in the environment is less clear. Time series of monthly mean phytoplankton colour values as compiled by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey are analysed to infer relationships between the NAO and phytoplankton dynamics throughout the North Atlantic Ocean. While a few areas display highly significant (p   0.05) trends in the CPR colour time series during the period 1948 2000 nominally significant (p   0.20) positive trends are widespread across the basin particularly on the continental shelves and in a transition zone stretching across the Central North Atlantic. When long term trends are removed from both the NAO index and CPR colour time series the correlation between them ceases to be significant. Several hypotheses are proposed to explain the observed variability in the CPR colour and its relationship with climate in the North Atlantic. 1834:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this paper we present results from dynamic simulations of the Northern California Current ecosystem based on historical estimates of fishing mortality relative fishing effort and climate forcing. Climate can affect ecosystem productivity and dynamics both from the bottom up (through short and long term variability in primary and secondary production) as well as from the top down (through variability in the abundance and spatial distribution of key predators). We have explored how the simplistic application of climate forcing through both bottom up and top down mechanisms improves the fit of the model dynamics to observed population trends and reported catches for exploited components of the ecosystem. We find that using climate as either a bottom up or a top down forcing mechanism results in substantial improvements in model performance such that much of the variability observed in single species models and dynamics can be replicated in a multi species approach. Using multiple climate variables (both bottom up and top down) simultaneously did not provide significant improvement over a model with only one forcing. In general results suggest that there do not appear to be strong trophic interactions among many of the longer lived slower growing rockfish roundfish and flatfish in this ecosystem although strong interactions were observed in shrimp salmon and small flatfish populations where high turnover and predation rates have been coupled with substantial changes in many predator populations over the last 40 years. 1835:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Populations of the copepod species Calanus finmarchicus often dominate the springtime biomass and secondary production of shelf ecosystems throughout the North Atlantic Ocean. Recently it has been hypothesised that interannual to interdecadal fluctuations observed in such populations are driven primarily by climate associated changes in ocean circulation. Here we compare evidence from the North Sea and Gulf of Maine Western Scotian Shelf (GoM WSS) linking fluctuations in C finmarchicus abundance to changes in ocean circulation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A particularly striking contrast emerges from this Trans Atlantic comparison: whereas the North Sea C finmarchicus population exhibits a negative correlation with the NAO index the GoM WSS population exhibits a more complex positive association with the index. The physical processes underlying these contrasting population responses are discussed in the context of regional to basin scale circulation changes associated with the NAO. 1838:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We applaud the recent review by Cowling and Sykes of the experimental evidence for interactions among CO2 climate and plant physiology and the implications for pollen based paleoclimatic reconstructions. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 a basic nutrient for plants have a long history of variation. Ice core records from the last 420 000 years show glacial concentrations as low as 200 ppm and interglacial levels up to 280 ppm. The physiological responses of plants to different concentrations of atmospheric CO2 may in turn affect their climatic optima by altering such properties as their water use efficiency and thermal optima for maximal growth. If full glacial CO2 concentrations of 200 ppm in fact affected plant climate interactions then as Cowling and Sykes rightly point out this effect would weaken a key assumption underlying pollen based paleoclimatic reconstructions: that the observed relationship between modern pollen abundances and climate can be transferred to fossil pollen abundances. The type of photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4) available to a plant largely determines its response to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations so that the greatest effects of CO2 upon community composition should occur in mixed communities or at ecotones between C3 and C4 dominated communities. Because accurate estimates of past climates are important so is the rapidly improving knowledge of plant CO2 interactions coming forward from physiological studies. From their review of the physiological evidence Cowling and Sykes draw two main conclusions: the pollen based reconstructions of climate during the last glacial maximum (LGM) may be overestimating its dryness and LGM climates may have been cooler than inferred from the fossil pollen. We concur with their point about dryness but doubt their case for a warm bias in the pollen based temperature reconstructions. 1840:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Century scale climate changes reshaped circulation patterns over the North Atlantic and adjacent regions during the last glacial to interglacial transition. Here we show that vegetation across eastern North America shifted dramatically at the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas chronozone (YDC: 12 900 11 600 cal yr B.P.) when changes in ocean circulation rapidly cooled and then warmed the North Atlantic sea surface. On both the site specific scale and the continental scale vegetation changed only gradually during the millennia before (15 000 13 000 cal yr B.P.) and after (11 000 9000 cal yr B.P.) the YDC but climate changes ca 12 900 and 11 600 cal yr B.P. altered the vegetation on both spatial scales within centuries. Plant associations changed and some taxa rapidly migrated hundreds of kilometers ( 300km within similar to100yr). In limited regions near the North Atlantic coast abrupt cooling ca 12 900 cal yr B.P. resulted in a return to earlier vegetation types. Elsewhere however the vegetation patterns during the YDC were distinct from those of both earlier and later intervals. They indicate abrupt non reversing seasonal temperature changes that were probably related to atmospheric circulation changes during the YDC rather than to the direct influence of North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. Atmospheric circulation patterns during the YDC were unique within the last 21 000yr because of a unique combination of climate controls. Insolation ice sheet extent and atmospheric composition were significantly different from their full glacial states even when the North Atlantic returned to near full glacial conditions. The YDC vegetation patterns demonstrate (1) rapid ecological responsiveness to abrupt climate change and (2) spatially varied patterns of YDC climate change. 1842:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Effective integration of optical remote sensing with flux measurements across multiple scales is essential for understanding global patterns of surface atmosphere fluxes of carbon and water vapor. SpecNet (Spectral Network) is an international network of cooperating investigators and sites linking optical measurements with flux sampling for the purpose of improving our understanding of the controls on these fluxes. An additional goal is to characterize disturbance impacts on surface atmosphere fluxes. To reach these goals key SpecNet objectives include the exploration of scaling issues development of novel sampling tools standardization and intercomparison of sampling methods development of models and statistical methods that relate optical sampling to fluxes exploration of component fluxes validation of satellite products and development of an informatics approach that integrates disparate data sources across scales. Examples of these themes are summarized in this review. 1843:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this study spectral indices were calculated from single date HyMap (3 m; 126 bands) Hyperion (30 m; 242 bands) ASTER (15 30 m; 9 bands) and a time series of MODIS nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBAR; 1 km 7 bands) for a study area surrounding the Tumbarumba flux tower site in eastern Australia. The study involved: a) the calculation of a range of physiologically based vegetation indices from ASTER HyMap Hyperion and MOD43B NBAR imagery over the flux tower site; b) comparison across scales between HyMap Hyperion and MODIS for the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the Red Green ratio; c) analysis of relationships between tower based flux and light use efficiency (LUE) measurements and seasonal and climatic constraints on growth; and d) examination of relationships between fluxes LUE and time series of NDVI NDWI and Red Green ratio. Strong seasonal patterns of variation were observed in NDWI and Red Green ratio from MODIS NBAR. Correlations between fine (3 and 30 m) and coarse (1 km) scale indices for a small region around the flux tower site were moderately good for Red Green ratio but poor for NDWI. Hymap NDWI values for the understorey canopy were much lower than values for the tree canopy. MODIS NDWI was negatively correlated with CO(2) fluxes during warm and cool seasons. The correlation indicated that surface reflectance affected by a spectrally bright grassland understorey canopy was decoupled from growth of trees with access to deep soil moisture. The application of physiologically based indices at earth observation scale requires careful attention to applicability of band configurations contribution of vegetation components to reflectance signals mechanistic relationships between biochemical processes and spectral indexes and incorporation of ancillary information into any analysis. 1844:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Reliable and repeatable field sampling methods are needed for monitoring ecosystem optical properties linked to carbon flux. Here we describe a tram system consisting of a dual detector spectrometer mounted on a robotic cart for mobile sampling of ecosystem spectral reflectance. To illustrate the application of this system for monitoring dynamic ecosystem activity we illustrate how the tram can be used for exploring the multiple factors influencing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) a measure of vegetation greenness and a key optical indicator of vegetation carbon dioxide assimilation. With this system we collected five years of NDVI data for a chaparral ecosystem in Southern California subject to extreme disturbance. Key factors affecting NDVI at this site included snow cover sky conditions (clear vs. cloudy) time of day season species composition and environmental perturbations such as rainfall drought and fire. Applications of this tram system include ecosystem monitoring satellite validation and developing surface atmosphere flux models from remote sensing. 1845:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Some form of the light use efficiency (LUE) model is used in most models of ecosystem carbon exchange based on remote sensing. The strong relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and light absorbed by green vegetation make models based on LUE attractive in the remote sensing context. However estimation of LUE has proven problematic since it varies with vegetation type and environmental conditions. Here we propose that LUE may in fact be correlated with vegetation greenness (measured either as NDVI at constant solar elevation angle or a red edge chlorophyll index) making separate estimates of LUE unnecessary at least for some vegetation types. To test this we installed an automated tram system for measurement of spectral reflectance in the footprint of an eddy covariance flux system in the Southern California chaparral. This allowed us to match the spatial and temporal scales of the reflectance and flux measurements and thus to make direct comparisons over time scales ranging from minutes to years. The 3 year period of this study included both   normal   precipitation years and an extreme drought in 2002. In this sparse chaparral vegetation diurnal and seasonal changes in solar angle resulted in large variation in NDVI independent of the actual quantity of green vegetation. In fact one would come to entirely different conclusions about seasonal changes in vegetation greenness depending on whether NDVI at noon or NDVI at constant solar elevation angle were used. Although chaparral vegetation is generally considered   evergreen   we found that the majority of the shrubs were actually semi deciduous leading to large seasonal changes in NDVI at constant solar elevation angle. LUE was correlated with both greenness indices at the seasonal timescale across all years. In contrast the relationship between LUE and PRI was inconsistent. PRI was well correlated with LUE during the   normal   years but this relationship changed dramatically during the extreme drought. Contrary to expectations none of the spectral reflectance indices showed consistent relationships with CO2 flux or LUE over the diurnal time course possibly because of confounding effects of sun angle and stand structure on reflectance. These results suggest that greenness indices can be used to directly estimate CO2 exchange at weekly timescales in this chaparral ecosystem even in the face of changes in LUE. Greenness indices are unlikely to be as good predictors of CO2 exchange in dense evergreen vegetation as they were in the sparse semi deciduous chaparral. However since relatively few ecosystems are entirely evergreen at large spatial scales or over long time spans due to disturbance these relationships need to be examined across a wider range of vegetation types. 1846:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tethered balloon remote sensing platforms can be used to study radiometric issues in terrestrial ecosystems by effectively bridging the spatial gap between measurements made on the ground and those acquired via airplane or satellite. In this study the Short Wave Aerostat Mounted Imager (SWAMI) tethered balloon mounted platform was utilized to evaluate linear and nonlinear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) for a grassland conifer forest ecotone during the summer of 2003. Hyperspectral measurement of a 74 m diameter ground instantaneous field of view (GIFOV) attained by the SWAMI was studied. Hyperspectral spectra of four common endmembers bare soil grass tree and shadow were collected in situ and images captured via video camera were interpreted into accurate areal ground cover fractions for evaluating the mixture models. The comparison between the SWAMI spectrum and the spectrum derived by combining in situ spectral data with video derived areal fractions indicated that nonlinear effects occurred in the near infrared (NIR) region while nonlinear influences were minimal in the visible region. The evaluation of hyperspectral and multispectral mixture models indicated that nonlinear mixture model derived areal fractions were sensitive to the model input data while the linear mixture model performed more stably. Areal fractions of bare soil were overestimated in all models due to the increased radiance of bare soil resulting from side scattering of NIR radiation by adjacent grass and trees. Unmixing errors occurred mainly due to multiple scattering as well as close endmember spectral correlation. In addition though an apparent endmember assemblage could be derived using linear approaches to yield low residual error the tree and shade endmember fractions calculated using this technique were erroneous and therefore separate treatment of endmembers subject to high amounts of multiple scattering  shadows and trees) must be done with caution. Including the short wave infrared (SWIR) region in the hyperspectral and multispectral endmember data significantly reduced the Pearson correlation coefficient values among endmember spectra. Therefore combination of visible NIR and SWIR information is likely to further improve the utility of SMA in understanding ecosystem structure and function and may help narrow uncertainties when utilizing remotely sensed data to extrapolate trace glas flux measurements from the canopy scale to the landscape scale. 1847:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The goal of this study was to explore the utility of the 970 nm water band index (WBI) in estimating evapotranspiration and vegetation water status for a semiarid shrubland ecosystem. Between 2001 and 2003 spectral reflectance coupled with CO2 and water flux data were collected at Sky Oaks Biological Field Station a chaparral dominated ecosystem in southern California and one of the sites within the SpecNet network. The reflectance data were collected either by walking along a 100 m transect or by using a semi automated tram system installed later at the site along the same 100 m transect. CO2 and water flux data were gathered with an eddy covariance flux tower adjacent to the tram system. The 970 nm WBI and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were derived from the spectral reflectance. The two indices were expressed both as points approximately a meter apart along the transect and as whole transect averages where all of the reflectance values along the transect were averaged together simulating a large pixel. This study encompassed a wet year with normal precipitation (2001) a 100 year record drought (2002) and a recovery year (2003) allowing for comparison over time and between precipitation regimes. Species specific responses to wet and dry periods were evident in the reflectance spectra providing a basis for separating species based on their optical properties. The WBI was significantly correlated with the NDVI revealing a strong link between canopy water content and green canopy structure; however this relationship varied with species and water status providing evidence for the independence of these two optical indices. The WBI was also strongly linked to surface atmosphere fluxes explaining 49 PeRcEnT of the variance in the water vapor flux and 24 PeRcEnT of the carbon dioxide fluxes. These results suggest that WBI or other similar water status indices may be useful variables in modeling CO2 and water fluxes when combined with other physiological environmental and atmospheric factors. 1848:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The local scale spatial distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed PAR (APAR) and net all wave radiation (Q ) across the top of a forest canopy was investigated as a function of topography sky conditions and forest heterogeneity for a forested hilly study site located in south central Indiana USA that is part of the FLUX NET and SpecNet networks. The method to estimate spatial variability of radiation components utilized theoretical radiation modeling applied to a topographic model combined with spatial distribution of leaf area index derived from IKONOS imagery and empirical models derived from data collected on a single flux tower. Modeled PAR and Q compared consistently well with observations from a single tower with differences typically less than 10 PeRcEnT although clear sky conditions were simulated more accurately than cloudy conditions. Spatial variability of radiation was found to be very sensitive to topographic relief and could be scaled linearly by mean slope angle. Decreases in optical transmissivity and increases in cloudiness had a strong effect of reducing both the spatial average and standard deviation of radiation components. Spatial variability of APAR was 53 PeRcEnT greater than PAR and the characteristic scale of variance was reduced due to finer scale and magnitude of variance of LAI. Clear seasonal patterns existed in both spatial average and standard deviation values with summer producing the largest mean values and weakest spatial variability due to smaller solar zenith angles and seasonality in both optical transmissivity (scaled linearly by specific humidity) and cloudiness. These findings of spatial variability illustrate the need to characterize the complex landscape patterns at flux tower sites particularly where the goal is to relate flux tower data to satellite imagery. 1849:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To determine the degree of comparability between three spectrometers (Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec Pro FR (FR) Analytical Spectral Devices HandHeld (HH) and UniSpec Spectral Analysis System (UN)) leaf spectra of three species (Cafea arabica Lantana camara Eriobotrya japonica) recorded from each instrument were compared using two illumination viewing and field of view (FOV) scenarios. Scenario 1 eliminated differences due to illumination viewing and FOV conditions. Scenario 2 represented a typical illumination and viewing set up for each instrument. Six vegetation indices were computed from the raw spectra as well as spectra (1) interpolated to 1 nm intervals (the sampling interval of the FR) and (2) interpolated to 3.3 nm (the sampling interval of the UN). The spectra measured from the three instruments differed in both shape and amplitude more so for scenario 2 than scenario 1. In many cases indices obtained using one instrument differed significantly from the same indices obtained using the other two instruments (but the same leaves) regardless of scenario. The severity of these differences varied between indices. Interpolation was generally ineffective in matching the spectra from the various instruments. Care should be exercised when comparing indices generated from spectra measured from different instruments. 1850:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Using field data Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data a multi scale analysis of ecosystem optical proper ties was performed for Sky Oaks a Southern California chaparral ecosystem in the spectral network (SpecNet) and FLUXNET networks. The study covered a 4 year period (2000 2004) which included a severe drought in 2002 and a subsequent wildfire in July 2003 leading to extreme perturbation in ecosystem productivity and optical properties. Two vegetation greenness indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) and a measure of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (WAR) were compared across sampling platforms which ranged in pixel size from 1m (tram system in the field) to 1000m (MODIS satellite sensor). The three MODIS products closely followed the same seasonal trends as the tram and AVIRIS data but tended to be higher than the tram and AVIRIS values particularly for fPAR and NDVI. Following a wildfire that removed all green vegetation the overestimation in MODIS MAR values was particularly clear. The MODIS MAR algorithm (version 4 vs. v.4.1) had a significant effect on the degree of overestimation with v. 4.1 improving the agreement with the other sensors (AVIRIS and tram) for vegetated conditions but not for low post fire values. The differences between MODIS products and the products from the other platform sensors could not be entirely attributed to differences in sensor spectral responses or sampling scale. These results are consistent with several other recently published studies that indicate that MODIS overestimates MAR and thus net primary production (NPP) for many terrestrial ecosystems and demonstrates the need for proper validation of MODIS terrestrial biospheric products by direct comparison against optical signals at other spatial scales as is now possible at several SpecNet sites. The study also demonstrates the utility of in situ field sampling  tram systems) and hyperspectral aircraft imagery for proper interpretation of satellite data taken at coarse spatial scales. 1851:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Using simple models derived from spectral reflectance we mapped the patterns of ecosystem CO2 and water fluxes in a semi arid site in southern California during a period of extreme disturbance marked by drought and fire. Employing a combination of low (similar to 2 km) and high (similar to 16 km) altitude images from the hyperspectral Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) acquired between April 2002 and September 2003 and ground data collected from an automated tram system several vegetation indices were calculated for Sky Oaks field station a FLUX NET and SpecNet site located in northern San Diego County (CA USA). Based on the relationships observed between the fluxes measured by the eddy covariance tower and the vegetation indices net CO2 and water vapor flux maps were derived for the region around the flux tower. Despite differences in the scale of the images (from similar to 2 in to 16 m pixel size) as well as marked differences in environmental conditions (drought in 2002 recovery in early 2003 and fire in mid 2003) net CO2 and water flux modeled from AVIRIS derived reflectance indices (NDVI PRI and WBI) effectively tracked changes in tower fluxes across both drought and fire and readily revealed spatial variation in fluxes within this landscape. After an initial period of net carbon uptake drought and fire caused the ecosystem to lose carbon to the atmosphere during most of the study period. Our study shows the power of integrating optical and flux data in LUE models to better understand factors driving surface atmosphere carbon and water vapor flux cycles one of the main goals of SpecNet. 1852:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We describe a new remote sensing system called the Short Wave Aerostat Mounted Imager (SWAMI). The SWAMI is designed to acquire co located video imagery and hyperspectral data to study basic remote sensing questions and to link landscape level trace gas fluxes with spatially and temporally appropriate spectral observations. The SWAMI can fly at altitudes up to 2km above ground level to bridge the spatial gap between radiometric measurements collected near the surface and those acquired by other aircraft or satellites. The SWAMI platform consists of a dual channel hyperspectral spectroradiometer video camera GPS thermal infrared sensor and several meteorological and control sensors. All SWAMI functions  data acquisition and sensor pointing) can be controlled from the ground via wireless transmission. Sample data from the sampling platform are presented along with several potential scientific applications of SWAMI data. 1890:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An important question for salmon restoration efforts in the western USA is How should habitat restoration plans be altered to accommodate climate change effects on stream flow and temperature? We developed a decision support process for adapting salmon recovery plans that incorporates (1) local habitat factors limiting salmon recovery (2) scenarios of climate change effects on stream flow and temperature (3) the ability of restoration actions to ameliorate climate change effects and (4) the ability of restoration actions to increase habitat diversity and salmon population resilience. To facilitate the use of this decision support framework we mapped scenarios of future stream flow and temperature in the Pacific Northwest region and reviewed literature on habitat restoration actions to determine whether they ameliorate a climate change effect or increase life history diversity and salmon resilience. Under the climate change scenarios considered here summer low flows decrease by 35 75 PeRcEnT west of the Cascade Mountains maximum monthly flows increase by 10 60 PeRcEnT across most of the region and stream temperatures increase between 2 and 6 degrees C by 2070 2099. On the basis of our literature review we found that restoring floodplain connectivity restoring stream flow regimes and re aggrading incised channels are most likely to ameliorate stream flow and temperature changes and increase habitat diversity and population resilience. By contrast most restoration actions focused on in stream rehabilitation are unlikely to ameliorate climate change effects. Finally we illustrate how the decision support process can be used to evaluate whether climate change should alter the types or priority of restoration actions in a salmon habitat restoration plan.  1927:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change challenges organisms to adapt or move to track changes in environments in space and time. We used two measures of thermal shifts from analyses of global temperatures over the past 50 years to describe the pace of climate change that species should track: the velocity of climate change (geographic shifts of isotherms over time) and the shift in seasonal timing of temperatures. Both measures are higher in the ocean than on land at some latitudes despite slower ocean warming. These indices give a complex mosaic of predicted range shifts and phenology changes that deviate from simple poleward migration and earlier springs or later falls. They also emphasize potential conservation concerns because areas of high marine biodiversity often have greater velocities of climate change and seasonal shifts. 1930:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Construction of four dams on the lower Snake River (in northwestern United States) between 1961 and 1975 altered salmon spawning habitat elevated smolt and adult migration mortality and contributed to severe declines of Snake River salmon populations. By applying a matrix model to long term population data we found that (i) dam passage improvements have dramatically mitigated direct mortality associated with dams; (ii) even if main stem survival were elevated to 100 PeRcEnT Snake River spring summer chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) would probably continue to decline toward extinction; and (iii) modest reductions in first year mortality or estuarine mortality would reverse current population declines. 1936:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem responses to increased variability in rainfall a prediction of general circulation models were assessed in native grassland by reducing storm frequency and increasing rainfall quantity per storm during a 4 year experiment. More extreme rainfall patterns without concurrent changes in total rainfall quantity increased temporal variability in soil moisture and plant species diversity. However carbon cycling processes such as soil CO2 flux CO2 uptake by the dominant grasses and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) were reduced and ANPP was more responsive to soil moisture variability than to mean soil water content. Our results show that projected increases in rainfall variability can rapidly alter key carbon cycling processes and plant community composition independent of changes in total precipitation. 1955:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One of the major concerns with a potential change in climate is that an increase in extreme events will occur. Results of observational studies suggest that in many areas That have been analyzed changes in total precipitation are amplified at the tails and changes in some temperature extremes have been observed. Model output has been analyzed that shows changes in extreme events for future climates such as increases in extreme high temperatures. decreases in extreme Low temperatures and increases in intense precipitation events. In addition the societal infrastructure is becoming more sensitive to weather and climate extremes which would be exacerbated by climate change. In wild plants and animals climate induced extinctions distributional and phenological changes and species range shifts are being documented at an increasing rate. Several apparently gradual biological changes are Linked to responses to extreme weather and climate events. 1962:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Scenarios of changes in biodiversity for the year 2100 can now be developed based on scenarios of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide climate vegetation and Land use and the known sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems land use change probably wilt have the largest effect followed by climate change nitrogen deposition biotic exchange and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change. 1984:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human exposure to excessively warm weather especially in cities is an increasingly important public health problem. This study examined heat related health inequalities within one city in order to understand the relationships between the microclimates of urban neighborhoods population characteristics thermal environments that regulate microclimates and the resources people possess to cope with climatic conditions. A simulation model was used to estimate an outdoor human thermal comfort index (HTCI) as a function of local climate variables collected in 8 diverse city neighborhoods during the summer of 2003 in Phoenix USA. HTCI is an indicator of heat stress a condition that can cause illness and death. There were statistically significant differences in temperatures and HTCI between the neighborhoods during the entire summer which increased during a heat wave period. Lower socioeconomic and ethnic minority groups were more likely to live in warmer neighborhoods with greater exposure to heat stress. High settlement density sparse vegetation and having no open space in the neighborhood were significantly correlated with higher temperatures and HTCI. People in warmer neighborhoods were more vulnerable to heat exposure because they had fewer social and material resources to cope with extreme heat. Urban heat island reduction policies should specifically target vulnerable residential areas and take into account equitable distribution and preservation of environmental resources. 1986:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Social studies of science have ascribed a central role to trust in the constitution of knowledge yet there are few studies of its operation in the large interorganizational structures increasingly required for scientific work. We begin an examination of 53 collaborations in physics and related sciences with two unexpected findings: (1) trust is no higher in projects formed through pre existing relationships than those without such ties; and (2) there is no relationship between trust and performance. Why then is trust viewed as important? Because trust is inversely associated with conflict. In the second part of this paper three axes of conflict are described as well as their sources in the interdependencies of collaborative projects. More important than trust for an understanding of large scientific collaborations is the organization of interaction between structural components such as research teams. In the third part we examine participant accounts of performance. Collaborations that experience uncertainties in resource acquisition are more likely to be viewed as successful than those formed under more routine conditions. In conclusion we suggest that the segmentation of scientific collaborations through bureaucratic organization can impose a structure for interaction resembling work that is actually noncollaborative. 19:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,200:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,202:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,204:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,2053:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plants are finely tuned to the seasonality of their environment and shifts in the timing of plant activity  phenology) provide some of the most compelling evidence that species and ecosystems are being influenced by global environmental change. Researchers across disciplines have observed shifting phenology at multiple scales including earlier spring flowering in individual plants and an earlier spring green up of the land surface revealed in satellite images. Experimental and modeling approaches have sought to identify the mechanisms causing these shifts as well as to make predictions regarding the consequences. Here we discuss recent advances in several fields that have enabled scaling between species responses to recent climatic changes and shifts in ecosystem productivity with implications for global carbon cycling. 2056:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predicting the impacts of climate change on species is one of the biggest challenges that ecologists face. Predictions routinely focus on the direct effects of climate change on individual species yet interactions between species can strongly influence how climate change affects organisms at every scale by altering their individual fitness geographic ranges and the structure and dynamics of their community. Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change. We propose a framework based on ideas from global change biology community ecology and invasion biology that uses community modules to assess how species interactions shape responses to climate change. 2070:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The factors that shape vertical root distributions in different soils and under different climates and vegetation are poorly understood. This makes it difficult to parameterize root profiles in vegetation hydrology biogeochemistry or global circulation models. Recently it has been proposed that vertical root distributions in the vadose zone could be predicted from soil water infiltration and extraction patterns as a function of climatic variability soil and vegetation characteristics. A number of ecological factors favor shallow over deep roots suggesting that root profiles of plant communities may tend to be as shallow as possible and as deep as needed to fulfill evapotranspirational demands. To test this hypothesis a stochastic one dimensional soil water infiltration and extraction model (SWIEM) was developed that simulates soil water infiltration through 600 discrete soil layers to a depth of 6 m. Water input is simulated in Monte Carlo fashion based on site specific long term precipitation data. Water extraction proceeds from the top down with extraction depths determined by potential evapotranspiration ( PET) and the vertical distribution of soil water. The resulting shallowest possible water extraction profile was tested against nine measured root profiles from long term ecological research sites in different biomes. Two other approaches based on mean root distributions for biomes and an empirical regression model were also compared to the observed root distributions. Soil water extraction patterns predicted by the SWIEM model matched observed vertical root distributions better than the other two approaches. These findings show that vertical root distributions in different biomes tend to approach the shallowest possible shape thereby creating a useful null model for future research on root distributions and a promising tool for parameterization of global models. 2072:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In ungauged basins predicting streamflows is a major challenge for hydrologists and water managers with approaches needed to systematically generalize hydrometric properties from limited stream gauge data. Here we illustrate how a geologic geomorphic framework can provide a basis for describing summer base flow and recession behavior at multiple scales for tributaries of the Willamette River in Oregon. We classified the basin into High Cascade and Western Cascade provinces based on the age of the underlying volcanic bedrock. Using long term U. S. Geological Survey stream gauge records we show that summer streamflow volumes recession characteristics and timing of response to winter recharge are all linearly related to the percent of High Cascade geology in the contributing area. This analysis illustrates how geology exerts a dominant control on flow regimes in this region and suggests that a geological framework provides a useful basis for interpreting and extrapolating hydrologic behavior. 208:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,213:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,225:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,233:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A Marine Climate Impacts Workshop was held from 29 April to 3 May 2012 at the US National Center of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara. This workshop was the culmination of a series of six meetings over the past three years which had brought together 25 experts in climate change ecology analysis of large datasets palaeontology marine ecology and physical oceanography. Aims of these workshops were to produce a global synthesis of climate impacts on marine biota to identify sensitive habitats and taxa to inform the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) process and to strengthen research into ecological impacts of climate change. 23:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Numerous long term studies in seasonal habitats have tracked interannual variation in first flowering date (FFD) in relation to climate documenting the effect of warming on the FFD of many species. Despite these efforts long term phenological observations are still lacking for many species. If we could forecast responses based on taxonomic affinity however then we could leverage existing data to predict the climate related phenological shifts of many taxa not yet studied. We examined phenological time series of 1226 species occurrences (1031 unique species in 119 families) across seven sites in North America and England to determine whether family membership (or family mean FFD) predicts the sensitivity of FFD to standardized interannual changes in temperature and precipitation during seasonal periods before flowering and whether families differ significantly in the direction of their phenological shifts. Key results: Patterns observed among species within and across sites are mirrored among family means across sites; early flowering families advance their FFD in response to warming more than late flowering families. By contrast we found no consistent relationships among taxa between mean FFD and sensitivity to precipitation as measured here. Family membership can be used to identify taxa of high and low sensitivity to temperature within the seasonal temperate zone plant communities analyzed here. The high sensitivity of early flowering families (and the absence of early flowering families not sensitive to temperature) may reflect plasticity in flowering time which may be adaptive in environments where early season conditions are highly variable among years. 241:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is strong correlative evidence that human induced climate warming is contributing to changes in the timing of natural events. Firm attribution however requires cause and effect links between observed climate change and altered phenology together with statistical confidence that observed regional climate change is anthropogenic. We provide evidence for phenological shifts in the butterfly Heteronympha merope in response to regional warming in the southeast Australian city of Melbourne. The mean emergence date for H. merope has shifted 1.5 days per decade over a 65 year period with a concurrent increase in local air temperatures of approximately 0.168 degrees C per decade. We used a physiologically based model of climatic influences on development together with statistical analyses of climate data and global climate model projections to attribute the response of H. merope to anthropogenic warming. Such mechanistic analyses of phenological responses to climate improve our ability to forecast future climate change impacts on biodiversity. 248:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Robin Rorick of the American Petroleum Institute (API) and his colleagues question our doubt that subsurface dispersant application was required to prevent Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil from reaching the sea surface. The photographs provided as support for the need for and efficacy of subsurface dispersant do not allow scientifically rigorous conclusions in the absence of quantitative measurements of subsurface processes and dynamics of materials transport. Despite our close connectivity to industry government and academic research we are unaware of any compelling peer reviewed data documenting the efficacy necessity and consequences of subsurface dispersant application during the DWH spill. Rorick and his colleagues assertions reinforce long standing concerns that oil spill responses are not based on sufficient science. We expect a higher level of commitment to excellence from an industry capable of so much more. We questioned the unsupported assumption that the vast majority of hydrocarbon retention at depth is attributable solely to subsurface dispersant use. Rorick and his colleagues argument regarding Johansen and colleagues contradicts our understanding of that experiment. In a review of the study Adams and Socolofsky noted that in the absence of dispersants and under even less favorable conditions (shallower colder less turbulent water) for generating natural dispersion than those of the DWH blowout __most oil was not recovered at the surface suggesting it was in the form of widely dispersed fine droplets__. Even assuming that Rorick and his colleagues are correct their own calculations suggest as little as 5 PeRcEnT of the oil may have reached the surface in that study. By emphasizing the dubious high end estimate of 90 PeRcEnT they reinforce our argument that unequivocal data are not available and that rigorous process oriented study is necessary. Quantifying the behavior transport fate and effects of hydrocarbons from deepwater blowouts with and without dispersants at various application rates is fundamental to the public interest. Because subsurface dispersant application is increasingly touted as a necessary new response method rigorous scientific answers to questions not only of efficacy but also of the impact of subsurface retention of highly dispersed oil dispersant droplets on particle feeders and an array of other organisms throughout the water column are urgently needed. Such answers do not come from a few photographs. Rorick and his colleagues restricted focus solely on preventing oil from reaching the sea surface reflects a failure to acknowledge the need for a new oil spill model that includes an assessment of risk below the surface following deepwater blowouts. We welcome formal process oriented data and urge API to pursue such studies. 252:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Emissions of greenhouse gases are expected to raise global mean temperature over the next century by 1.0 3.5 C. Ecologists from around the world have begun experiments to investigate the effects of global warming on terrestrial ecosystems the aspect of global climate change that attracts the most public attention. The effort to understand response to warming builds on a history of investigations of the effects of elevated CO2 on plants and ecosystems. There are important differences however between increases in atmospheric CO2 and temperature change both in the temporal and spatial patterns of change and in how they affect ecosystems. The scientists involved in temperature change research have had to face new technical and conceptual challenges in designing and interpreting their experiments. In this paper we describe these challenges and present a conceptual framework for interpreting experimental results and predicting effects of warming on ecosystemsProjections of global warming from General Circulation Models (GCMs) are now familiar to both scientists and nonscientists. Knowing however that the mean global temperature will increase by 1.0 3.5 C tells us little about how temperatures will change in a particular location or how the ecosystems in that location will respond. For instance temperature increases are likely to be greater at higher latitudes where initial conditions are below 0 C most of the year and growing season temperatures are only a few degrees higher. Even a small increase in average temperature at higher latitudes could increase both the length of the unfrozen period and degree day accumulations by large percentages. The implications of a given increase in temperature will also depend on the initial temperature at a specific location because the rate of many biological processes in relation to temperature typically peaks at some intermediate temperature. An increase from an initially low temperature may cause an increase in photosynthesis for example while an increase from an initially high temperature might cause photosynthesis to decrease. Finally even as the average temperature increases some parts of the globe are actually expected to experience cooling. The complexities of these patterns of change in temperature contrast with the increase in atmospheric CO2 for which there is no large temporal or spatial variation either in current levels or in the rate or pattern of increase. 255:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,25:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,260:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Events or conditions occurring at one point in environmental space can have consequences elsewhere. For example the management decision to feed elk over winter in the National Elk Refuge near Jackson Wyoming has led to an artificially large increase in the winter population of elk just north of the city. Natural elk deaths in winter have led to a concentrated supply of carrion that in turn has attracted a large population of ravens. But in the spring the elk migrate northward to their summer ranges and the localized carrion disappears. The enlarged raven population also disperses northward with individuals foraging expediently on whatever they can find including songbird eggs and nestlings. As a consequence nest predation is more severe in the Snake River riparian zone than it would be without winter feeding of the large migratory elk population. Thus an event or condition at the Elk Refuge (feeding elk) leads to propagation of nest predators across environmental space with consequences (high nest predation) elsewhere. As another example construction of a dam characteristically leads to sediment deposition in the impoundment. By reducing the sediment load of water coming through or over the dam the capacity of downstream water to carry new sediment increases__the river becomes more erosive. As a result the main stem of the river below the dam is excavated thereby accelerating tributary down cutting throughout the entire drainage network. Tributary incision through the network accelerates slope movement destabilizes vegetation cover and degrades habitat. In this way the new condition (the upstream dam) propagates geomorphological and ecological effects throughout the terrain below the dam. These examples are two of a large variety of phenomena involving the transmission of cause and effect across environmental space. Such phenomena occur for many reasons and at many spatial and temporal scales. They clearly are ecologically important. How do ecologists address such phenomena? 267:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Changes in Earths surface temperatures caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are expected to affect global and regional precipitation regimes. Interactions between changing precipitation regimes and other aspects of global change are likely to affect natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems as well as human society. Although much recent research has focused on assessing the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to rising carbon dioxide or temperature relatively little research has focused on understanding how ecosystems respond to changes in precipitation regimes. Here we review predicted changes in global and regional precipitation regimes outline the consequences of precipitation change for natural ecosystems and human activities and discuss approaches to improving understanding of ecosystem responses to changing precipitation. Further we introduce the Precipitation and Ecosystem Change Research Network (PrecipNet) a new interdisciplinary research network assembled to encourage and foster communication and collaboration across research groups with common interests in the impacts of global change on precipitation regimes ecosystem structure and function and the human enterprise. 268:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,271:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Lake Baikal the worlds largest oldest and most biotically diverse lake is responding strongly to climate change according to recent analyses of water temperature and ice cover. By the end of this century the climate of the Baikal region will be warmer and wetter particularly in winter. As the climate changes ice cover and transparency water temperature wind dynamics and mixing and nutrient levels are the key abiotic variables that will shift thus eliciting many biotic responses. Among the abiotic variables changes in ice cover will quite likely alter food web structure and function most because of the diverse ways in which ice affects the lakes dominant primary producers (endemic diatoms) the top predator (the worlds only freshwater seal) and other abiotic variables. Melting permafrost will probably exacerbate the effects of additional anthropogenic stressors (industrial pollution and cultural eutrophication) and could greatly affect ecosystem functioning. 299:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,313:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate is a driver of biotic systems. It affects individual fitness population dynamics distribution and abundance of species and ecosystem structure and function. Regional variation in climatic regimes creates selective pressures for the evolution of locally adapted physiologies morphological adaptations  color patterns surface textures body shapes and sizes) and behavioral adaptations  foraging strategies and breeding systems). In the absence of humans broad scale long term consequences of climatic warming on wild organisms are generally predictable. Evidence from Pleistocene glaciations indicates that most species responded ecologically by shifting their ranges poleward and upward in elevation rather than evolutionary through local adaptation  morphological changes). But these broad patterns tell us little about the relative importance of gradual climatic trends as compared to extreme weather events in shaping these processes. Here evidence is brought forward that extreme weather events can be implicated as mechanistic drivers of broad ecological responses to climatic trends. They are therefore essential to include in predictive biological models such as doubled CO2 scenarios. 335:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,344:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,346:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We developed spatially explicit representations for seasonal high seas (open ocean) thermal habitats for six species of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and evaluated the effects of natural climate variability and projected changes under three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in high seas habitat due to natural climatic variation in 20th century were small relative to that under anthropogenic climate change scenarios for the middle to late 21st century. Under a multimodel ensemble average of global climate model outputs using A1B (medium) emissions scenario for the entire study area (North Pacific and part of Arctic Ocean) projected winter habitats of sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) decreased by 38 PeRcEnT and summer habitat decreased by 86 PeRcEnT for Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) 45 PeRcEnT for sockeye 36 PeRcEnT for steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) 30 PeRcEnT for coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) 30 PeRcEnT for pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and 29 PeRcEnT for chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon by 2100. Reductions were 25 PeRcEnT lower for B1 (lower) emissions and 7 PeRcEnT higher for A2 (higher) emissions scenarios. Projected habitat losses were largest in the Gulf of Alaska and western and central subarctic North Pacific. Nearly complete losses of Gulf of Alaska habitat for sockeye in both seasons and Chinook in summer raise important policy issues for North American fishery managers and governments. 350:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,353:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change effects on biodiversity are being documented now frequently in the form of changes in phenology and distributional shifts. However the form that these effects will take over a longer timespan is unclear; for this understanding a quantitative validated predictive approach is key. Here we use ecological niche modeling and general circulation model outputs to estimate future potential geographic distributions of 111 Canadian butterfly species. We develop future estimates under two emission scenarios from each of two climate change modeling centers; future projections for biodiversity are not only scenario dependent (more severe emission scenarios produce more severe effects on species distributions) but also model dependent (the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis results were more severe than the Hadley Centre results). One interesting feature is the appearance of disjunctions in species distributions hence creating   vicariant events   over very short time periods. In general however a cost of 1 PeRcEnT 3 PeRcEnT additional loss of species distributions is associated with more severe scenarios of emissions and climate change suggesting that subtle biodiversity consequences are associated with the different climate futures debated in political circles. 356:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This review highlights the latest developments associated with the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecology. Over the last decade the NDVI has proven extremely useful in predicting herbivore and non herbivore distribution abundance and life history traits in space and time. Due to the continuous nature of NDVI since mid 1981 the relative importance of different temporal and spatial lags on population performance can be assessed widening our understanding of population dynamics. Previously thought to be most useful in temperate environments the utility of this satellite derived index has been demonstrated even in sparsely vegetated areas. Climate models can be used to reconstruct historical patterns in vegetation dynamics in addition to anticipating the effects of future environmental change on biodiversity. NDVI has thus been established as a crucial tool for assessing past and future population and biodiversity consequences of change in climate vegetation phenology and primary productivity. 357:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Combinations of habitat loss and climate change can alter the distribution of environmental conditions available to organisms. The magnitude and direction of these changes may have important implications for ecological processes and species persistence. This study explored the potential impacts of projected changes in climate and land use for five fairy shrimp species (Crustacea: Anostraca) endemic to vernal pools in the Central Valley ecoregion of California U.S.A. Scenarios describing habitat extent and climate were developed for 2040 and 2100 and compared to a 1990s baseline. Hydrologic conditions in vernal pools were found to be sensitive to projected climate changes and in the absence of habitat loss warmer temperatures and greater winter precipitation would drive vernal pools toward longer more frequent periods of inundation. However existing biological reserves for three of the five species are biased toward drier areas and if unprotected habitat were lost the net change in hydrologic conditions would be reversed with remaining habitat providing shorter less frequent inundations. Species with unbiased representation in reserves do not show this reversal and they have predictable shifts in hydrologic conditions. These results demonstrate the importance of biologically and climatically representative reserve systems under climate change and habitat loss. 384:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,385:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,391:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change impacts depend in large part on land management decisions; interactions between global changes and local resource management however rarely have been quantified. We used a combination of experimental manipulations and simulation modeling to investigate the effects of interactions between cattle grazing and regional climate change on vernal pool communities. Data from a grazing exclosure study indicated that 3 years after the removal of grazing ungrazed vernal pools dried an average of 50 days per year earlier than grazed control pools. Modeling showed that regional climate change could also alter vernal pool hydrology. Increased temperatures and winter precipitation were predicted to increase periods of inundation. We evaluated the ecological implications of interactions between grazing and climate change for branchiopods and the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) at four sites spanning a latitudinal climate gradient. Grazing played an important role in maintaining the suitability of vernal pool hydrological conditions for fairy shrimp and salamander reproduction. The ecological importance of the interaction varied nonlinearly across the region. Our results show that grazing can confound hydrologic changes driven by climate change and play a critical role in maintaining the hydrologic suitability of vernal pools for endangered aquatic invertebrates and amphibians. These observations suggest an important limitation of impact assessments of climate change based on experiments in unmanaged ecosystems. The biophysical impacts of land management may be critical for understanding the vulnerability of ecological systems to climate change. 393:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change will likely have profound effects on cold water species of freshwater fishes. As temperatures rise cold water fish distributions may shift and contract in response. Predicting the effects of projected stream warming in stream networks is complicated by the generally poor correlation between water temperature and air temperature. Spatial dependencies in stream networks are complex because the geography of stream processes is governed by dimensions of flow direction and network structure. Therefore forecasting climate driven range shifts of stream biota has lagged behind similar terrestrial modeling efforts. We predicted climate induced changes in summer thermal habitat for 3 cold water fish speciesjuvenile Chinook salmon rainbow trout and bull trout (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha O. mykiss and Salvelinus confluentus respectively)in the John Day River basin northwestern United States. We used a spatially explicit statistical model designed to predict water temperature in stream networks on the basis of flow and spatial connectivity. The spatial distribution of stream temperature extremes during summers from 1993 through 2009 was largely governed by solar radiation and interannual extremes of air temperature. For a moderate climate change scenario estimated declines by 2100 in the volume of habitat for Chinook salmon rainbow trout and bull trout were 6995 PeRcEnT 5187 PeRcEnT and 86100 PeRcEnT respectively. Although some restoration strategies may be able to offset these projected effects such forecasts point to how and where restoration and management efforts might focus. 399:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,422:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,43:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,440:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The distributions of most pollinator species are poorly documented despite their importance in providing ecosystem services. While these and other organisms are threatened by many aspects of the human. enterprise anthropogenic climate change is potentially the most severe threat to pollinator biodiversity. Mounting evidence demonstrates that there have already been biotic responses to the relatively small climate changes that have occurred this century. These include wholesale shifts of relatively well documented butterfly and bird species in Europe and North America. Although studies of such phenomena are supported by circumstantial evidence their findings are also consistent with predictions derived from current modals of spatial patterns of species richness. Using new GIS methods that are highly precise and accurate document spatial patterns of Canadian butterfly diversity. These are strongly related to contemporary climate and particularly to potential evapotranspiration. An even more noteworthy finding is the fact that for the first time habitat heterogeneity measured as the number of land cover types in each study unit is proven to be an equally strong predictor of butterfly richness in a region where energy alone was thought to be the best predictor of diversity. Although previous studies reveal similar relationships between energy and diversity they fail to detect the powerful link between richness and habitat heterogeneity. The butterflies of Canada provide a superb baseline for studying the effects of climate on contemporary patterns of species richness and comprise the only complete pollinator taxon for which this sort of analysis is currently possible. 443:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,460:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,470:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,484:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,492:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,498:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,4:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,503:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,507:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,513:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,516:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,519:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Delineating protected areas for sensitive species is a growing challenge as changing climate alters the geographic pattern of habitats as well as human responses to those shifts. When human impacts are expected within projected ranges of threatened species there is often demand to demarcate the minimum habitat required to ensure the species persistence. Because diminished or wide ranging populations may not occupy all viable (and needed) habitat at once one must identify thresholds of resources that will support the species even in unoccupied areas. Long term data on the shifting mosaic of critical resources may indicate ranges of future variability. We addressed these issues for the Spectacled Eider (Somateria fischeri) a federally threatened species that winters in pack ice of the Bering Sea. Changing climate has decreased ice cover and severely reduced the eiders benthic prey and has increased prospects for expansion of bottom trawling that may further affect prey communities. To assess long term changes in habitats that will support eiders we linked data on benthic prey sea ice and weather from 1970 to 2001 with a spatially explicit simulation model of eider energy balance that integrated field laboratory and remote sensing studies. Areas estimated to have prey densities adequate for eiders in 1970 1974 did not include most areas that were viable 20 years later (1993 1994). Unless the entire area with adequate prey in 1993 1994 had been protected the much reduced viable area in 1999 2001 might well have been excluded. During long non foraging periods (as at night) eiders can save much energy by resting on ice vs. floating on water; thus loss of ice cover in the future might substantially decrease the area in which prey densities are adequate to offset the eiders energy needs. For wide ranging benthivores such as eiders our results emphasize that fixed protected areas based on current conditions can be too small or inflexible to subsume long term shifts in habitat conditions. Better knowledge of patterns of natural disturbance experienced by prey communities and appropriate allocation of human disturbance over seasons or years may yield alternative strategies to large scale closures that may be politically and economically problematic. 528:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,529:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Given climate change thermal stress related mass coral bleaching events present one of the greatest anthropogenic threats to coral reefs. While corals and their symbiotic algae may respond to future temperatures through genetic adaptation and shifts in community compositions the climate may change too rapidly for coral response. To test this potential for response here we develop a model of coral and symbiont ecological dynamics and symbiont evolutionary dynamics. Model results without variation in symbiont thermal tolerance predict coral reef collapse within decades under multiple future climate scenarios consistent with previous threshold based predictions. However model results with genetic or community level variation in symbiont thermal tolerance can predict coral reef persistence into the next century provided low enough greenhouse gas emissions occur. Therefore the level of greenhouse gas emissions will have a significant effect on the future of coral reefs and accounting for biodiversity and biological dynamics is vital to estimating the size of this effect. 530:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,532:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,536:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,538:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,562:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,569:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,571:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,580:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,593:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,596:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,600:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,610:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,616:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,616:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological processes and community composition in vernal pools are dominated by a suite of interrelated hydrologic factors collectively described as a hydrologic regime. This study reports on the development of a hydrologic regime simulation model called PHYDO and its application to two locations in California. PHYDO calculates daily water balance using meteorological data and parameters describing basin morphology soil characteristics and vegetation cover. The model provides daily estimates of water depth volume and temperature as well as statistics on seasonal and inter annual variability. Model predictions are compared to field observations for coastal vernal pools in southern Santa Barbara County CA USA (2000 2001) and interior vernal pools near Oroville in the Central Valley of CA USA (1994 1998). The model was also run for the period 1990 2000 to investigate patterns of inter annual variation in hydrologic conditions at both sites. Results indicate that vernal pool hydrologic regimes can be modeled primarily based on the direct interception of precipitation and the loss of water to evapotranspiration. Results also suggest differences in hydrologic limiting factors between the sites. Storm frequency appears to be the primary control of hydrologic conditions for Santa Barbara pools while basin morphology dominates conditions in Oroville. These findings suggest ecologically important differences in hydrologic regimes between the two vernal pool localities and PHYDO provides a new set of tools for quantifying these differences for a range of hydrologic variables. 626:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Reliable assessments of how human activities will affect wildlife populations are essential for making scientifically defensible resource management decisions. A principle challenge of predicting effects of proposed management development or conservation actions is the need to incorporate multiple biotic and abiotic factors including land use and climate change that interact to affect wildlife habitat and populations through time. Here we demonstrate how models of land use climate change and other dynamic factors can be integrated into a coherent framework for predicting wildlife population trends. Our framework starts with land use and climate change models developed for a region of interest. Vegetation changes through time under alternative future scenarios are predicted using an individual based plant community model. These predictions are combined with spatially explicit animal habitat models to map changes in the distribution and quality of wildlife habitat expected under the various scenarios. Animal population responses to habitat changes and other factors are then projected using a flexible individual based animal population model. As an example application we simulated animal population trends under three future land use scenarios and four climate change scenarios in the Cascade Range of western Oregon. We chose two birds with contrasting habitat preferences for our simulations: winter wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes) which are most abundant in mature conifer forests and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) which prefer more open shrubby habitats. We used climate and land use predictions from previously published studies as well as previously published predictions of vegetation responses using FORCLIM an individual based forest dynamics simulator. Vegetation predictions were integrated with other factors in PATCH a spatially explicit individual based animal population simulator. Through incorporating effects of landscape history and limited dispersal our framework predicted population changes that typically exceeded those expected based on changes in mean habitat suitability alone. Although land use had greater impacts on habitat quality than did climate change in our simulations we found that small changes in vital rates resulting from climate change or other stressors can have large consequences for population trajectories. The ability to integrate bottom up demographic processes like these with top down constraints imposed by climate and land use in a dynamic modeling environment is a key advantage of our approach. The resulting framework should allow researchers to synthesize existing empirical evidence and to explore complex interactions that are difficult or impossible to capture through piecemeal modeling approaches. . 642:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper integrates recent efforts to map the distribution of biomes for the late Quaternary with the detailed evidence that plant species have responded individualistically to climate change at millennial timescales. Using a fossil pollen data set of over 700 sites we review late Quaternary vegetation history in northern and eastern North America across levels of ecological organization from individual taxa to biomes and apply the insights gained from this review to critically examine the biome maps generated from the pollen data. Higher order features of the vegetation  plant associations physiognomy) emerge from individualistic responses of plant taxa to climate change and different representations of vegetation history reveal different aspects of vegetation dynamics. Vegetation distribution and composition were relatively stable during full glacial times (2100017 000 yr BP) calendar years and during the mid to late Holocene (7000 500 yr BP) but changed rapidly during the late glacial period and early Holocene (16000 .8000 yr BP) and after 500 yr BP Shifts in plant taxon distributions were characterized by individualistic changes in population abundances and ranges and included large east west shifts in distribution in addition to the northward redistribution of most taxa. Modern associations such as Fagus Tsuga and Picea Alnus Betula date to the early Holocene whereas other associations common to the late glacial period  Picea Cyperaceae Fraxinus Ostrya Carpinus). no longer exist. Biomes are dynamic entities that have changed in distribution composition; and structure over time. The late Pleistocene suite of biomes is distinct from those that grew during the Holocene. The pollen based biome reconstructions are able to capture the major features of late Quaternary vegetation but downplay the magnitude and variety of vegetational responses to climate change by (1) limiting apparent land cover change to ecotones (2) masking internal variations in biome composition and (3) obscuring the range shifts and changes in abundance among individual taxa. The compositional and structural differences between full glacial and recent biomes of the same type are. similar to or greater than the spatial heterogeneity in the composition and structure of present day biomes. This spatial and temporal heterogeneity allows biome maps to accommodate individualistic behavior among species but masks climatically important variations in taxonomic composition as well as structural differences between modern biomes and their ancient counterparts. 655:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,659:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,680:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Convergence between species niches and biological traits was investigated for 88 Leucadendron taxa in the Cape Floristic region. First niche separation analysis was performed to relate species niche positions breadths with bioclimatic gradients. These gradients of aridity seasonality of water availability heat and cold stress explained almost all variation in niche distributions. Species present in zones of extreme aridity or temperature exhibited narrower niche breadths than species situated in moderate sites suggesting that stress tolerant species do not occupy broad environmental ranges. Second species niche positions were related to selected biological traits. Species of and sites had significantly lower blade areas than did species of moist sites confirming a functional trade off between stress tolerance and productivity for leaf design. Species dispersal mode was correlated to species niche positions on the aridity gradient suggesting allometrically determined correlations between leaf design and the design of reproductive structures. Species niche positions were also correlated with flowering traits with species that initiate flowering in winter found under Mediterranean climate influence and species that initiate flowering in spring in sites with greater summer rainfall input. By interrelating species niche positions on bioclimatic gradients with selected biological traits we explored a novel biogeographical approach to understanding species distributions. 685:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Earlier spring phenology observed in many plant species in recent decades provides compelling evidence that species are already responding to the rising global temperatures associated with anthropogenic climate change. There is great variability among species however in their phenological sensitivity to temperature. Species that do not phenologically   track   climate change may be at a disadvantage if their growth becomes limited by missed interactions with mutualists or a shorter growing season relative to earlier active competitors. Here we set out to test the hypothesis that phenological sensitivity could be used to predict species performance in a warming climate by synthesizing results across terrestrial warming experiments. We assembled data for 57 species across 24 studies where flowering or vegetative phenology was matched with a measure of species performance. Performance metrics included biomass percent cover number of flowers or individual growth. We found that species that advanced their phenology with warming also increased their performance whereas those that did not advance tended to decline in performance with warming. This indicates that species that cannot phenologically   track   climate may be at increased risk with future climate change and it suggests that phenological monitoring may provide an important tool for setting future conservation priorities. 710:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is often claimed that we do not understand the forces driving the global diversity gradient. However an extensive literature suggests that contemporary climate constrains terrestrial taxonomic richness over broad geographic extents. Here we review the empirical literature to examine the nature and form of the relationship between climate and richness. Our goals were to document the support for the climatically based energy hypothesis and within the constraints imposed by correlative analyses to evaluate two versions of the hypothesis: the productivity and ambient energy hypotheses. Focusing on studies extending over 800 km we found that measures of energy water or water energy balance explain spatial variation in richness better than other climatic and non climatic variables in 82 of 85 cases. Even when considered individually and in isolation water energy variables explain on average over 60 PeRcEnT of the variation in the richness of a wide range of plant and animal groups. Further water variables usually represent the strongest. predictors in the tropics subtropics and warm temperate zones whereas energy variables (for animals) or water energy variables (for plants) dominate in high latitudes. We conclude that the interaction between water and energy either directly or indirectly (via plant productivity) provides a strong explanation for globally extensive plant and animal diversity gradients but for animals there also is a latitudinal shift in the relative importance of ambient energy vs. water moving from the poles to the equator. Although contemporary climate is not the only factor influencing species richness and may not explain the diversity pattern for all taxonomic groups it is clear that understanding water energy dynamics is critical to future biodiversity research. Analyses that do not include water energy variables are missing a key component for explaining broad scale patterns of diversity. 731:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plant formations different from any extant today apparently were widespread in North America and Europe during the last deglaciation. produced by the independent biogeographic responses of plant taxa to climate change. Dissimilarity analyses of modern and fossil pollen samples in eastern North America show that the unique plant associations centered around the Great Lakes at 14 000 calendar years before present (yr BP) with high dissimilarities during 17 000 12 000 yr BP The late glacial fossil pollen assemblages are characterized by (1) high abundances of boreal conifers such as spruce and larch relative to their Holocene values. (2) high abundances of herbaceous types (sedge sage and ragweed) (3) high abundances of broad leaved deciduous types (ash hornbeam poplar hazel. and willow) and (4) the low abundance or absence of pine alder and birch. When the fossil pollen samples are assigned to biomes using the affinity score technique the late Pleistocene pollen samples are assigned to mixed parkland a biome that is not extant in North America today. The fastest vegetational changes occurred 13 000 11 000 yr BP when the late Pleistocene vegetation reorganized into the Holocene biomes which have persisted to today. Simulations by the Community Climate Model version I (CCM 1) suggest that late glacial climates were also unlike modern climates. featuring a   hypercontinental   mixture of colder than present winters warmer than present summers and lower than present precipitation. Dissimilarity analyses of the pollen data and CCMI simulations for 21 000. 16 000 14 000 11 000 and 6000 yr BP show that (1) the temporal and spatial distribution of high dissimilarities in the vegetation (relative to present) coincide with dissimilarities in simulated climate (2) the timing and spatial distribution of changes in the vegetation and simulated climate also agree and (3) the largest climatic and vegetational changes follow the peak period of dissimilarity from present. Taken together these three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the no analogue plant associations were in equilibrium with orbital and millennial scale climate change. Nonclimatic factors such as low atmospheric CO(2) concentrations and the presence of now extinct megafauna species may have increased the openness of the Pleistocene vegetation but by themselves cannot explain the observed mixture of boreal temperate and herbaceous taxa in the no analogue pollen assemblages nor can they explain the prevalence of no analogue pollen samples during the late glacial period. 751:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Studies of the impacts of climate and climate change on biological systems often attempt to correlate ecological responses with basin scale indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However such correlations while useful for detecting long term trends are unable to provide a mechanism linking the physical environment and ecological processes. Here we evaluate the effects of the NAO on recruitment variability of rocky intertidal invertebrates in the North Atlantic examining two possible climate related pathways. Using a highly conservative test we interpret associations with the NAO integrated over a season ( three months) as an indicator of atmospheric effects on newly settled recruits (NAO3) and the effects of the NAO integrated over six months (NAO6) as an indicator of changes in ocean circulation affecting patterns of larval transport. Through an extensive literature survey we found 13 time series restricted to southwest Ireland and Britain and comprising five species that could be used for statistical analysis. Significant correlations with NAO3 our proxy for atmospheric effects were observed in the south central domain of our study region ( southwest Ireland and south England). Significant correlations with NAO6 the proxy for ocean circulation effects were detected on southwest Ireland. The associations were detected for three ( two barnacles and a topshell) at two sites. These results suggest that the NAO can have effects on the recruitment of intertidal invertebrates through different pathways linked to climate and be distributed heterogeneously in space. Based on previous evidence and the sign and geographic location of significant correlations we suggest that winter NAO effects are likely to occur as a result of effects on the survival of early life stages settling during spring or through changes in phenology. Our results argue that a combination of modeling and synthesis can be used to generate hypotheses regarding the effects of climate on recruitment and aid in the design of field based tests of explicit ecological mechanisms. 822:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change and biological invasions are primary threats to global biodiversity that may interact in the future. To date the hypothesis that climate change will favour non native species has been examined exclusively through local comparisons of single or few species. Here we take a meta analytical approach to broadly evaluate whether non native species are poised to respond more positively than native species to future climatic conditions. We compiled a database of studies in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that reported performance measures of non native (157 species) and co occurring native species (204 species) under different temperature CO2 and precipitation conditions. Our analyses revealed that in terrestrial (primarily plant) systems native and non native species responded similarly to environmental changes. By contrast in aquatic (primarily animal) systems increases in temperature and CO2 largely inhibited native species. There was a general trend towards stronger responses among non native species including enhanced positive responses to more favourable conditions and stronger negative responses to less favourable conditions. As climate change proceeds aquatic systems may be particularly vulnerable to invasion. Across systems there could be a higher risk of invasion at sites becoming more climatically hospitable whereas sites shifting towards harsher conditions may become more resistant to invasions. 823:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climatic variation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a widespread influence on the population dynamics of many organisms worldwide. While previous analyses have related the dynamics of northern ungulates to the NAO there has been no comparable assessment for the species rich assemblages of tropical and subtropical Africa. Census records for 11 ungulate species in South Africas Kruger National Park over 1977 96 reveal severe population declines by seven species which were inadequately explained by indices of ENSO or its effects on annual rainfall totals. An additional influence was an extreme reduction in dry season rainfall concurrent with and perhaps related to a regional temperature rise possibly a signal of global warming.

They are often hard to predict but may have leading indicators which are detectable in advance. Potential leading indicators include wider swings in dynamics of key ecosystem variables slower return rates after perturbation and shift of variance towards lower frequencies. We evaluated these indicators using a food web model calibrated to long term whole lake experiments. We investigated whether impending regime shifts driven by gradual increase in exploitation of the top predator can create signals that cascade through food webs and be discerned in phytoplankton. Substantial changes in standard deviations return rates and spectra occurred near the switch point even two trophic levels removed from the regime shift in fishes. Signals of regime shift can be detected well in advance if the driver of the regime shift changes much more slowly than the dynamics of key ecosystem variables which can be sampled frequently enough to measure the indicators. However the regime shift may occur long after the driver has passed the critical point because of very slow transient dynamics near the critical point. Thus the ecosystem can be poised for regime shift by the time the signal is discernible. Field tests are needed to evaluate these indicators. 883:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species distribution models (SDMs) use spatial environmental data to make inferences on species range limits and habitat suitability. Conceptually these models aim to determine and map components of a species ecological niche through space and time and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non equilibrium contexts such as invasions translocations climate change and evolutionary shifts. 923:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Compelling evidence from studies of stream channel density supports the hypothesis that terrain and vegetation are coupled via water and energy fluxes. The slope of a classic power law relation between drainage density and water availability reverses sign and changes value where precipitation equals potential evapotranspiration. The change of slope indicates a   phase transition   from water to energy limited vegetation. To initiate a common biophysical theory for these power law relations and for the phase transition we partitioned precipitation into an infiltrated fraction available to plants and a fraction available for flow and thus erosion. To estimate infiltration we exploited invariance with respect to spatial scale at the transition. We tested the invariance hypothesis by analyzing the spatial distribution of energy limited vegetation over length scales between 8 000 and 256 000 m in the Columbia River Basin of the northwestern US which has a mixture of both phases. We observed a power law relation for the occurrence of energy limited vegetation based on annual fluxes. We defined two dimensionless parameters that describe excess available energy for photosynthesis and surplus liquid water for terrain formation. Specification of the conditions under which neither parameter changed with spatial scale in conjunction with a steady state water balance model enabled the formulation of an equation of soil infiltration at scales between 8 000 and 256 000 m. In water limited vegetation the equation enables the estimation of soil infiltration rates at arbitrary spatial scales for a given plant cover as a function of the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration. This work represents a first step towards the articulation of a biophysically sound theory about the ecology and hydrology of broad landscapes that respects a conservation law and scale invariance. 928:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Future disruptions to fire activity will threaten ecosystems and human well being throughout the world yet there are few fire projections at global scales and almost none from a broad range of global climate models (GCMs). Here we integrate global fire datasets and environmental covariates to build spatial statistical models of fire probability at a 0.5 degrees resolution and examine environmental controls on fire activity. Fire models are driven by climate norms from 16 GCMs (A2 emissions scenario) to assess the magnitude and direction of change over two time periods 2010 2039 and 2070 2099. From the ensemble results we identify areas of consensus for increases or decreases in fire activity as well as areas where GCMs disagree. Although certain biomes are sensitive to constraints on biomass productivity and others to atmospheric conditions promoting combustion substantial and rapid shifts are projected for future fire activity across vast portions of the globe. In the near term the most consistent increases in fire activity occur in biomes with already somewhat warm climates; decreases are less pronounced and concentrated primarily in a few tropical and subtropical biomes. However models do not agree on the direction of near term changes across more than 50 PeRcEnT of terrestrial lands highlighting major uncertainties in the next few decades. By the end of the century the magnitude and the agreement in direction of change are projected to increase substantially. Most far term model agreement on increasing fire probabilities (similar to 62 PeRcEnT) occurs at mid to high latitudes while agreement on decreasing probabilities (similar to 20 PeRcEnT) is mainly in the tropics. Although our global models demonstrate that long term environmental norms are very successful at capturing chronic fire probability patterns future work is necessary to assess how much more explanatory power would be added through interannual variation in climate variables. This study provides a first examination of global disruptions to fire activity using an empirically based statistical framework and a multi model ensemble of GCM projections an important step toward assessing fire related vulnerabilities to humans and the ecosystems upon which they depend. 940:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Disparate ecological datasets are often organized into databases post hoc and then analyzed and interpreted in ways that may diverge from the purposes of the original data collections. Few studies however have attempted to quantify how biases inherent in these data (for example species richness replication climate) affect their suitability for addressing broad scientific questions especially in under represented systems (for example deserts tropical forests) and wild communities. Here we quantitatively compare the sensitivity of species first flowering and leafing dates to spring warmth in two phenological databases from the Northern Hemisphere. One PEP725 has high replication within and across sites but has low species diversity and spans a limited climate gradient. The other NECTAR includes many more species and a wider range of climates but has fewer sites and low replication of species across sites. PEP725 despite low species diversity and relatively low seasonality accurately captures the magnitude and seasonality of warming responses at climatically similar NECTAR sites with most species showing earlier phenological events in response to warming. In NECTAR the prevalence of temperature responders significantly declines with increasing mean annual temperature a pattern that cannot be detected across the limited climate gradient spanned by the PEP725 flowering and leafing data. Our results showcase broad areas of agreement between the two databases despite significant differences in species richness and geographic coverage while also noting areas where including data across broader climate gradients may provide added value. Such comparisons help to identify gaps in our observations and knowledge base that can be addressed by ongoing monitoring and research efforts. Resolving these issues will be critical for improving predictions in understudied and under sampled systems outside of the temperature seasonal mid latitudes. 969:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predicted climate warming is expected to have profound effects on bark beetle population dynamics in the southwestern United States. Temperature mediated effects may include increases in developmental rates generations per year and changes in habitat suitability. As a result the impacts of Dendroctonus frontalis and Dendroctonus mexicanus on forest resources are likely subject to amplification. To assess the implications of such change we evaluated the generations per year of these species under three climate scenarios using a degree day development model. We also assessed economic impacts of increased beetle outbreaks in terms of the costs of application of preventative silvicultural treatments and potential economic revenues forgone. Across the southwestern USA the potential number of beetle generations per year ranged from 1 3 under historical climate an increase of 2 4 under the minimal warming scenario and 3 5 under the greatest warming scenario. Economic benefits of applying basal area reduction treatments to reduce forest susceptibility to beetle outbreaks ranged from  DoLlQuAnT 7.75 ha (NM) to  DoLlQuAnT 95.69 ha (AZ) under historical conditions and  DoLlQuAnT 47.96 ha (NM) to  DoLlQuAnT 174.58 ha (AZ) under simulated severe drought conditions. Basal area reduction treatments that reduce forest susceptibility to beetle outbreak result in higher net present values than no action scenarios. Coupled with other deleterious consequences associated with beetle outbreaks such as increased wildfires the results suggest that forest thinning treatments play a useful role in a period of climate warming. 974:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Policies for climate mitigation on land rarely acknowledge biophysical factors such as reflectivity evaporation and surface roughness. Yet such factors can alter temperatures much more than carbon sequestration does and often in a conflicting way. We outline a framework for examining biophysical factors in mitigation policies and provide some best practice recommendations based on that framework. Tropical projects avoided deforestation forest restoration and afforestation provide the greatest climate value because carbon storage and biophysics align to cool the Earth. In contrast the climate benefits of carbon storage are often counteracted in boreal and other snow covered regions where darker trees trap more heat than snow does. Managers can increase the climate benefit of some forest projects by using more reflective and deciduous species and through urban forestry projects that reduce energy use. Ignoring biophysical interactions could result in millions of dollars being invested in some mitigation projects that provide little climate benefit or worse are counter productive. 100:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article verifies that the ideal free distribution (IFD) is evolutionarily stable provided the payoff in each patch decreases with an increasing number of individuals. General frequency dependent models of migratory dynamics that differ in the degree of animal omniscience are then developed. These models do not exclude migration at the IFD where balanced dispersal emerges. It is shown that the population distribution converges to the IFD even when animals are nonideal  they do not know the quality of all patches). In particular the IFD emerges when animals never migrate from patches with a higher payoff to patches with a lower payoff and when some animals always migrate to the best patch. It is shown that some random migration does not necessarily lead to under matching provided migration occurs at the IFD. The effect of population dynamics on the IFD (and vice versa) is analyzed. Without any migration it is shown that population dynamics alone drive the population distribution to the IFD. If animal migration tends ( for each fixed population size) to the IFD then the combined migration population dynamics evolve to the population IFD independent of the two timescales  behavioral vs. population). 1021:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Molecular tools perform at their best when integrated with other data and approaches. The value of integrating approaches is especially high when the underlying genetic signal is relatively weak as occurs in many marine species. Recently studies combining genetic oceanographic behavioural and modelling approaches have provided new insights into the spatial ecology of marine populations in particular regarding larval migration barriers to dispersal and source sink population dynamics. In this perspectives piece we explore the advantages of a multidisciplinary approach to marine population genetics by (i) providing a synthesis of what has been learned about connectivity from studies that combine genetic data with other tools (ii) discussing how incorporation of ecological and oceanographic information into alternative hypotheses can boost inference when genetic power is low and (iii) summarizing recent innovations in statistical population genetics that enable seamless integration of ecological environmental and genetic data. These topics are covered in the context of how genetic inferences of connectivity and dispersal can contribute to pressing questions facing marine conservation and management. 1031:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Steady reduction of once extensive forested habitats into isolated fragments will have unintended consequences for genetically disrupted tree populations. Gene flow in forest trees involves both pollen and seed flow and here we describe two alternative analytical models for pollen flow analysis PARENTAGE and TWOGENER. With PARENTAGE models we can assess the numbers and frequency spectra of pollinating males for a single female and the spatial distribution of those pollinating males. Parentage analysis establishes the male parentage of offspring and uses the inter parent distances to establish the spatial distribution of pollination. With TWOGENER analysis we gauge the degree of pollen pool non overlap of widely spaced females. to derive estimates of the effective number of fathers per mother and the average distance of pollination. Parentage analysis suggests large numbers of fathers per mother while TWOGENER analysis suggests smaller numbers of effective pollinators. Because of TWOGENERs emphasis on   effective pollen flow   it tends to yield shorter average pollination distances. The two approaches are complementary but suited to different sampling designs and questions. Here we attempt to reconcile sometimes divergent findings while also discussing emerging findings on pollen movement across complex landscapes. 103:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Traditionally ecologists interested in habitat edges have focused on edge related gradients in patterns of species richness or abiotic variables. Here however we take a different perspective attempting to synthesize recent empirical results concerning the effects of habitat edges on population dynamics with contemporary theoretical developments to outline the ways in which species interactions and the dynamics of the communities in which they are embedded can be changed by habitat edges. We find a striking convergence between empirical notions of a patchs core area and analytical results from partial differential equation models. A review of both empirical and theoretical studies suggests four general classes of mechanisms through which habitat edges can have similar impacts on dissimilar types of species interactions. Specifically we focus on edges roles as dispersal barriers or filters edges influences on mortality edges involvement in spatial subsidies (in which dispersers intrapatch impacts are maintained by their activities in other habitats) and edges roles as generators of novel interactions. For each class of edge mediated effects we provide examples of how one can use spatial modeling to address the relevant questions on these topics which together form a key link between community dynamics and landscape structure. 1042:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Landscape ecology deals with the influence of spatial pattern on ecological processes. It considers the ecological consequences of where things are located in space where they are relative to other things and how these relationships and their consequences are contingent on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape mosaic at multiple scales in time and space. Traditionally landscape ecologists have focused their attention on terrestrial ecosystems and rivers and streams have been considered either as elements of landscape mosaics or as units that are linked to the terrestrial landscape by flows across boundaries or ecotones. Less often the heterogeneity that exists within a river or stream has been viewed as a riverscape in its own right. Landscape ecology can be unified about six central themes: (1) patches differ in quality (2) patch boundaries affect flows (3) patch context matters (4) connectivity is critical (5) organisms are important and (6) the importance of scale. Although riverine systems differ from terrestrial systems by virtue of the strong physical force of hydrology and the inherent connectivity provided by water flow all of these themes apply equally to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and to the linkages between the two. Landscape ecology therefore has important insights to offer to the study of riverine ecosystems but these systems may also provide excellent opportunities for developing and testing landscape ecological theory. The principles and approaches of landscape ecology should be extended to include freshwater systems; it is time to take the land out of landscape ecology. 1085:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Effective population size (N e) is an important genetic parameter because of its relationship to loss of genetic variation increases in inbreeding accumulation of mutations and effectiveness of selection. Like most other genetic approaches that estimate contemporary N e the method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) assumes a closed population and (in the most common applications) randomly recombining loci. We used analytical and numerical methods to evaluate the absolute and relative consequences of two potential violations of the closed population assumption: (1) mixture LD caused by occurrence of more than one gene pool which would downwardly bias (N) over cap (e) and (2) reductions in drift LD (and hence upward bias in (N) over cap (e)) caused by an increase in the number of parents responsible for local samples. The LD method is surprisingly robust to equilibrium migration. Effects of mixture LD are small for all values of migration rate (m) and effects of additional parents are also small unless m is high in genetic terms. LD estimates of N e therefore accurately reflect local (subpopulation) N e unless m   similar to 5 10 PeRcEnT. With higher m (N) over cap (e) converges on the global (metapopulation) N e. Two general exceptions were observed. First equilibrium migration that is rare and hence episodic can occasionally lead to substantial mixture LD especially when sample size is small. Second nonequilibrium pulse migration of strongly divergent individuals can also create strong mixture LD and depress estimates of local N e. In both cases assignment tests Bayesian clustering and other methods often will allow identification of recent immigrants that strongly influence results. In simulations involving equilibrium migration the standard LD method performed better than a method designed to jointly estimate N e and m. The above results assume loci are not physically linked; for tightly linked loci the LD signal from past migration events can persist for many generations with consequences for N e estimates that remain to be evaluated. 109:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,109:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We introduce a model for the dynamics of a patchy population in a stochastic environment and derive a criterion for its persistence. This criterion is based on the geometric mean (GM) through time of the spatial arithmetic mean of growth rates. For the population to persist the GM has to be greater than or equal to1. The GM increases with the number of patches (because the sampling error is reduced) and decreases with both the variance and the spatial covariance of growth rates. We derive analytical expressions for the minimum number of patches (and the maximum harvesting rate) required for the persistence of the population. As the magnitude of environmental fluctuations increases the number of patches required for persistence increases and the fraction of individuals that can be harvested decreases. The novelty of our approach is that we focus on Malthusian local population dynamics with high dispersal and strong environmental variability from year to year. Unlike previous models of patchy populations that assume an infinite number of patches we focus specifically on the effect that the number of patches has on population persistence. Our work is therefore directly relevant to patchily distributed organisms that are restricted to a small number of habitat patches. 10:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological networks are typically complex constructions of species and their interactions. During the last decade the study of networks has moved from static to dynamic analyses and has attained a deeper insight into their internal structure heterogeneity and temporal and spatial resolution. Here we review discuss and suggest research lines in the study of the spatio temporal heterogeneity of networks and their hierarchical nature. We use case study data from two well characterized model systems (the food web in Broadstone Stream in England and the pollination network at Zackenberg in Greenland) which are complemented with additional information from other studies. We focus upon eight topics: temporal dynamic space for time substitutions linkage constraints habitat borders network modularity individual based networks invasions of networks and super networks that integrate different network types. Few studies have explicitly examined temporal change in networks and we present examples that span from daily to decadal change: a common pattern that we see is a stable core surrounded by a group of dynamic peripheral species which in pollinator networks enter the web via preferential linkage to the most generalist species. To some extent temporal and spatial scales are interchangeable  networks exhibit ergodicity) and we explore how space for time substitutions can be used in the study of networks. Network structure is commonly constrained by phenological uncoupling (a temporal phenomenon) abundance body size and population structure. Some potential links are never observed that is they are forbidden (fully constrained) or missing (a sampling effect) and their absence can be just as ecologically significant as their presence. Spatial habitat borders can add heterogeneity to network structure but their importance has rarely been studied: we explore how habitat generalization can be related to other resource dimensions. Many networks are hierarchically structured with modules forming the basic building blocks which can result in self similarity. Scaling down from networks of species reveals another finer grained level of individual based organization the ecological consequences of which have yet to be fully explored. The few studies of individual based ecological networks that are available suggest the potential for large intraspecific variance and in the case of food webs strong size structuring. However such data are still scarce and more studies are required to link individual level and species level networks. Invasions by alien species can be tracked by following the topological career of the invader as it establishes itself within a network with potentially important implications for conservation biology. Finally by scaling up to a higher level of organization it is possible to combine different network types  food webs and mutualistic networks) to form super networks and this new approach has yet to be integrated into mainstream ecological research. We conclude by listing a set of research topics that we see as emerging candidates for ecological network studies in the near future. 110:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We investigated the temporal coherence  the correlation or synchrony between time series) of annual abundances among populations of freshwater zooplankton in eight lakes in Ontario Canada from 1980 to 1992. We estimated temporal coherence using the intraclass correlation coefficient (r(i)). While values of r(i) were relatively low among comparisons of all eight lakes they were statistically significant for three of the seven common cladoceran and copepod taxa (Bosmina langirostris Leptodiaptomus minutus and Mesocyclops edax). These significant: positive correlations imply that a portion of the interannual variation in abundance was produced by factors operating on a scale larger than the individual lake catchments Because the eight lake analysis might obscure strong but conflicting patterns among lakes in the region we identified homogeneous and temporally coherent subsets of lakes for each species using an exploratory stepwise deletion procedure The resultant homogeneous subsets exhibited much greater temporal coherence accounting fur 47 PeRcEnT (Eubosmina) to 84 PeRcEnT (Leptodiaptomus) of the interannual variation in abundance. Our results suggest that the factors affecting annual variation in zooplankton abundance must be sought both within lakes and beyond their watersheds. 112:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We study the consequences of asymmetric dispersal rates (e. g. due to wind or current) for adaptive evolution in a system of two habitat patches. Asymmetric dispersal rates can lead to overcrowding of the   downstream   habitat resulting in a source sink population structure in the absence of intrinsic quality differences between habitats or can even cause an intrinsically better habitat to function as a sink. Source sink population structure due to asymmetric dispersal rates has similar consequences for adaptive evolution as a source sink structure due to habitat quality differences: natural selection tends to be biased toward the source habitat. We demonstrate this for two models of adaptive evolution: invasion of a rare allele that improves fitness in one habitat but reduces it in the other and antagonistic selection on a quantitative trait determined by five additive loci. If a habitat can sustain a population without immigration the conditions for adaptation to that habitat are most favorable if there is little or no immigration from the other habitat; the influence of emigration depends on the magnitude of the allelic effects involved and other parameters. If however the population is initially unable to persist in a given habitat without immigration our model predicts that the population will be most likely to adapt to that habitat if the dispersal rates in both directions are high. Our results highlight the general message that the effect of gene flow upon local adaptation should depend profoundly on the demographic context of selection. 1165:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Patterns of pollen dispersal are central to both the ecology and evolution of plant populations. However the mechanisms controlling either the dispersal process itself or our estimation of that process may be influenced by site specific factors such as local forest structure and nonuniform adult genetic structure. Here we present an extension of the AMOVA model applied to the recently developed TWOGENER analysis of pollen pool structure. This model dubbed the Stepwise AMOVA (StAMOVA) focuses on determining to what extent ecological demographic and or environmental factors influence the observed genetic variation in spatially separated pollen pools. The analysis is verified for efficacy using an extensive battery of simulations illustrating: ( 1) how nonuniform adult genetic structure influences the differentiation of spatially separated pollen pools and ( 2) how effectively the Stepwise analysis performs in carrying out the appropriate corrections. Finally the model is applied to a Quercus alba data set from which we have prior evidence that the adult genetic structure is nonuniformly distributed across the sampling landscape. From this data set we show how the Stepwise model can be applied to remove the effects of spatial adult genetic structure on pollen pool differentiation and contrast these results with those derived from the original TWOGENER analysis. 1166:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Use of genetic methods to estimate effective population size (N e) is rapidly increasing but all approaches make simplifying assumptions unlikely to be met in real populations. In particular all assume a single unstructured population and none has been evaluated for use with continuously distributed species. We simulated continuous populations with local mating structure as envisioned by Wrights concept of neighborhood size (NS) and evaluated performance of a single sample estimator based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) which provides an estimate of the effective number of parents that produced the sample (N b). Results illustrate the interacting effects of two phenomena drift and mixture that contribute to LD. Samples from areas equal to or smaller than a breeding window produced estimates close to the NS. As the sampling window increased in size to encompass multiple genetic neighborhoods mixture LD from a two locus Wahlund effect overwhelmed the reduction in drift LD from incorporating offspring from more parents. As a consequence (N) over cap (b) never approached the global N e even when the geographic scale of sampling was large. Results indicate that caution is needed in applying standard methods for estimating effective size to continuously distributed populations. 1172:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Competition for resources is one of the main evolutionary explanations for dispersal from the natal area. For humans this explanation has received little attention despite the key role dispersal is thought to play in shaping social systems. I examine the link between dispersal and resources using historical data on people from the small farming town of Oakham Massachusetts (1750 1850). I reconstruct individual life histories through a variety of records identifying dispersers their age at dispersal and their destinations. I find that sex fathers wealth and social status and age at fathers death were all significantly associated with one or more dispersal variables. Birth order and number of siblings were not significantly associated with any of the dispersal variables. I also use wills and deeds to study transfers of land from fathers to sons. More stayers than dispersers acquired Oakham land from their fathers but some sons who acquired Oakham land later dispersed. I discuss the causality underlying the relationship between dispersal and resource acquisition as well as implications for a general understanding of human dispersal. 1215:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent theoretical studies on population synchrony have focused on the role of dispersal. environmental correlation and density dependence in single species. Trophic interactions have received less attention. We explored how trophic interactions affect spatial synchrony. We considered a host parasitoid coupled map lattice to understand how the self organizing spatial patterns generated by such dynamics affect synchrony. In particular we calculated the spatial correlation functions (SCF) associated with travelling waves spatial chaos and crystal lattices. Travelling waves were associated with cyclic SCF (called second order SCF) that differed greatly from those seen in spatial chaos or crystal lattices. Such U shaped patterns of spatial synchrony which have not been predicted by single species models have been reported recently in real data. Thus the shape of the SCF can provide a test for trophically generated spatiotemporal dynamics. We also calculated the cross correlation function between the parasitoid and the host. Relatively high parasitoid mobility resulted in high within patch synchrony of the dynamics of the two species. However with relatively high host mobility the parasitoid dynamics began to lag spatially behind those of the host. We speculated that this spatial lag between the host and parasitoid is the ultimate source of travelling waves because the spatial cross correlation in turn affects host dynamics. A new method to estimate the spatial cross correlation function between two species was developed as an integral part of the study. 1216:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The harlequin bug a herbivore on bladderpod is attacked by two specialist egg parasitoids Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii. Ooencyrtus can out compete Trissolcus in the laboratory but coexistence is the norm in field populations. Despite the heavy mortality inflicted by the two parasitoids the host parasitoid interaction is persistent in all sites that have been studied in southern California. I manipulated inter patch distances in a field experiment to determine whether spatial processes drive parasitoid coexistence and or host parasitoid dynamics. I first tested the hypothesis that the parasitoids coexist via a dispersal competition trade off. Both parasitoid species took significantly longer to colonize isolated patches than well connected patches suggesting that they have comparable dispersal abilities. Ooencyrtus did not exclude Trissolcus even when inter patch distances were reduced to 25 30 PeRcEnT of those observed in natural populations. These data suggest that parasitoid coexistence can occur in the absence of a dispersal advantage to the inferior competitor. Since the treatments with isolated vs. well connected patches did not differ in parasitoid composition I next asked whether isolation would destabilize or drive extinct the host multiparasitoid interaction. No local extinctions of bugs or parasitoids were observed during the 18 month study period. Bug populations in the isolated patches were no more variable than those in the well connected patches. In fact temporal variability in the experimentally isolated patches was comparable to that observed in highly isolated natural populations. These data argue against a strong effect of spatial processes on host parasitoid dynamics. Local processes may mediate both parasitoid coexistence as well as the host parasitoid interaction. 125:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,125:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many species have strong habitat preferences that directly influence population viability. For successful reintroduction of threatened populations that rely on habitat structures the correct placement of artificial structures is also important to population persistence. In this paper we present a hierarchical approach to the problem of translocating animals that rely on permanent habitat structures in which we first use population dynamics data to identify areas of suitable habitat and then identify optimal configuration for habitat structures. We use data collected from a non endangered conspecific population of the endangered riparian woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes riparia) to examine the degree to which the distribution of dens in translocation sites might influence the likelihood that animals persist in their new environment. We characterize the habitats in which dens occur analyze their spatial clustering and compare them to temporal changes in population status for sex and age classes. We compare the potential efficacy of translocation efforts using spatial analysis versus solely habitat based approaches and identify the optimal spatial configuration of dens that should be considered in this translocation effort. We found that patterns of habitat use were positively correlated with overstorey cover and animal weight was positively correlated with understorey cover. Woodrats appear to select den locations on the basis of understorey cover but also benefit from dense overstorey cover and distance to nearest tree. Our results suggest that in translocation efforts artificial dens should be placed in clusters within a radius of 15 m as values above and below this value showed negative correlations with body mass. Translocations should occur after reproductive events which occur in April and August for woodrats in southern California. Our analyses provide practical guidelines in determining appropriate timing and spacing for translocation events in the context of animal condition minimizing disease transmission and reproduction. 1269:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We use focal species analysis to apply a graph theoretic approach to landscape connectivity in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. In doing so we demonstrate the utility of a mathematical graph as an ecological construct with respect to habitat connectivity. Graph theory is a well established mainstay of information technology and is concerned with highly efficient network flow. It employs fast algorithms and compact data structures that are easily adapted to landscape level focal species analysis. American mink (Mustela vison) and prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) share the same habitat but have different dispersal capabilities and therefore provide interesting comparisons on connections in the landscape. We built graphs using GIS coverages to define habitat patches and determined the functional distance between the patches with least cost path modeling. Using graph operations concerned with edge and node removal we found that the landscape is fundamentally connected for mink and fundamentally unconnected for prothonotary warblers. The advantage of a graph theoretic approach over other modeling techniques is that it is a heuristic framework which can be applied with very little data and improved from the initial results. We demonstrate the use of graph theory in a metapopulation context and suggest that graph theory as applied to conservation biology can provide leverage on applications concerned with landscape connectivity. 1278:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Multilocus genotypes using nine DNA microsatellite loci provided an effective and permanent individual identification mark for lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris the first example of genetic tagging for any elasmobranch species.

Corridors did not lead to different levels of activity of P. polionotus among the 3 patch types. Rather corridors influenced activity by changing patch shape: foraging in seed trays and total number of captures of P. polionotus tended to be greater at the patch center than at the patch edge but only in connected and winged patches where corridors or wings increased the amount of patch edge relative to the amount of core habitat in the patch. P. polionotus avoided open microhabitats near the patch edge in winged and connected patches but not open microhabitats near the patch interior suggesting that predation risk caused shifts in foraging near edges in connected and winged patches. Foraging in corridors and wings was generally low suggesting that both are high risk habitats where predation risk is not ameliorated by proximity to vegetative cover. By changing patch shape corridors caused changes in within patch activity of P. polionotus changing foraging patterns and potentially altering the dynamics of P. polionotus and the seeds they consume. 1313:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Habitat degradation is the slow and often subtle deterioration in habitat quality that accompanies human activities through increases in road density pesticide use hunting pressure etc. Such degradation is of particular concern in fragmented habitats where economic or jurisdictional boundaries rather than ecological ones determine the level of exploitation adjoining habitat patches endure. To examine the consequences habitat degradation might have on species interactions we posited a patch of pristine habitat surrounded by   matrix   habitat whose degradation level was variable. Using a coupled pair of diffusive Lotka Volterra competition equations with Robin (mixed) boundary conditions we modeled the dynamics of two competing species inhabiting the pristine patch and incorporated matrix degradation through a tunable   hostility   parameter representing species mortality rates in the matrix. We found that the numerical range of competition coefficients over which one species is the competitive dominant and the other inferior may grow or shrink as matrix quality deteriorates. In some cases degradation of the exterior habitat would bring about a complete competitive reversal inside the preserve. This result wherein a formerly inferior species supplants a formerly dominant one even inside the   protected   remnant patch itself has policy implications for both nature reserve design and management of human activities outside park boundaries. 133:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Crop pollination by bees and other animals is an essential ecosystem service. Ensuring the maintenance of the service requires a full understanding of the contributions of landscape elements to pollinator populations and crop pollination. Here the first quantitative model that predicts pollinator abundance on a landscape is described and tested. Using information on pollinator nesting resources floral resources and foraging distances the model predicts the relative abundance of pollinators within nesting habitats. From these nesting areas it then predicts relative abundances of pollinators on the farms requiring pollination services. Model outputs are compared with data from coffee in Costa Rica watermelon and sunflower in California and watermelon in New Jersey Pennsylvania (NJPA). Results from Costa Rica and California comparing field estimates of pollinator abundance richness or services with model estimates are encouraging explaining up to 80 PeRcEnT of variance among farms. However the model did not predict observed pollinator abundances on NJPA so continued model improvement and testing are necessary. The inability of the model to predict pollinator abundances in the NJPA landscape may be due to not accounting for fine scale floral and nesting resources within the landscapes surrounding farms rather than the logic of our model. The importance of fine scale resources for pollinator service delivery was supported by sensitivity analyses indicating that the models predictions depend largely on estimates of nesting and floral resources within crops. Despite the need for more research at the finer scale the approach fills an important gap by providing quantitative and mechanistic model from which to evaluate policy decisions and develop land use plans that promote pollination conservation and service delivery. 1343:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Simple analytical models assuming homogeneous space have been used to examine the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on metapopulation size. The models predict an extinction threshold a critical amount of suitable habitat below which the metapopulation goes deterministically extinct. The consequences of non random loss of habitat for species with localized dispersal have been studied mainly numerically. In this paper we present two analytical approaches to the study of habitat loss and its metapopulation dynamic consequences incorporating spatial correlation in both metapopulation dynamics as well as in the pattern of habitat destruction. One approach is based on a measure called metapopulation capacity given by the dominant eigenvalue of a   landscape   matrix which encapsulates the effects of landscape structure on population extinctions and colonizations. The other approach is based on pair approximation. These models allow us to examine analytically the effects of spatial structure in habitat loss on the equilibrium metapopulation size and the threshold condition for persistence. In contrast to the pair approximation based approaches the metapopulation capacity based approach allows us to consider species with long as well as short dispersal range and landscapes with spatial correlation at different scales. The two methods make dissimilar assumptions but the broad conclusions concerning the consequences of spatial correlation in the landscape structure are the same. Our results show that increasing correlation in the spatial arrangement of the remaining habitat increases patch occupancy that this increase is more evident for species with short range than long range dispersal and that to be most beneficial for metapopulation size the range of spatial correlation in landscape structure should be at least a few times greater than the dispersal range of the species. 1345:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There are two main types of metapopulation models. Spatially implicit models are analytically tractable but neglect spatial heterogeneities. Spatially explicit models are more realistic but too complex. In this paper I build a bridge between both approximations. I derive a new metapopulation model using a well known technique in population genetics. Spatial heterogeneities are captured by an aggregate statistical measure of spatial correlation When this correlation is zero space is homogenesus the model becomes the well known Levins model. As spatial correlation increases equilibrium patch occupancy decreases from what would be expected under the spatially homogeneous assumption. I proceed by testing how well spatial complexities from a spatially explicit simulation can be encapsulated by such an aggregate statistical measure. 1347:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a mathematical framework that combines extinction colonization dynamics with the dynamics of patch succession. We draw an analogy between the epidemiological categorization of individuals (infected susceptible latent and resistant) and the patch structure of a spatially heterogeneous landscape (occupied suitable empty suitable occupied unsuitable and empty unsuitable). This approach allows one to consider life history attributes that influence persistence in patchy environments  longevity colonization ability) in concert with extrinsic processes  disturbances succession) that lead to spatial heterogeneity in patch suitability. It also allows the incorporation of seed banks and other dormant life forms thus broadening patch occupancy dynamics to include sink habitats. We use the model to investigate how equilibrium patch occupancy is influenced by four critical parameters: colonization rate? extinction rate disturbance frequency and the rate of habitat succession. This analysis leads to general predictions about how the temporal scaling of patch succession and extinction colonization dynamics influences long term persistence. We apply the model to herbaceous early successional species that inhabit open patches created by periodic disturbances. We predict the minimum disturbance frequency required far viable management of such species in the Florida scrub ecosystem. 134:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Productivity of many crops benefits from the presence of pollinating insects so a decline in pollinator abundance should compromise global agricultural production. Motivated by the lack of accurate estimates of the size of this threat we quantified the effect of total loss of pollinators on global agricultural production and crop production diversity. The change in pollinator dependency over 46 years was also evaluated considering the developed and developing world separately. Using the extensive FAO dataset yearly data were compiled for 1961 2006 on production and cultivated area of 87 important crops which we classified into five categories of pollinator dependency. Based on measures of the aggregate effect of differential pollinator dependence the consequences of a complete loss of pollinators in terms of reductions in total agricultural production and diversity were calculated. An estimate was also made of the increase in total cultivated area that would be required to compensate for the decrease in production of every single crop in the absence of pollinators. The expected direct reduction in total agricultural production in the absence of animal pollination ranged from 3 to 8 PeRcEnT with smaller impacts on agricultural production diversity. The percentage increase in cultivated area needed to compensate for these deficits was several times higher particularly in the developing world which comprises two thirds of the land devoted to crop cultivation globally. Crops with lower yield growth tended to have undergone greater expansion in cultivated area. Agriculture has become more pollinator dependent over time and this trend is more pronounced in the developing than developed world. We propose that pollination shortage will intensify demand for agricultural land a trend that will be more pronounced in the developing world. This increasing pressure on supply of agricultural land could significantly contribute to global environmental change. 135:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Given a raster of environmental or habitat values representing a landscape we construct agglomerations of contiguous cells that constitute habitat   patches.   This land allocation problem has received inadequate attention in the academic literature and cannot be solved with commercial GIS packages. In our method each patch begins from an initial   seed   cell and continues to accrete neighboring cells until it reaches a desired total habitat value. This may be interpreted as reaching sufficient biological value to create a territory viable for the reproduction and survival of some demographic unit of a species  mating pair social group). This article presents a new method for generating identifying feasible patches. Depending on the type and variety of habitat and on user selected parameters patches can vary substantially in shape and size. A patch or territory alone would not be considered sufficient for conserving a species. The eventual use of the patches is as candidates for land units to be selected in order to form a reserve system. Patches should be very useful for conservation reserve planning because they build ecological knowledge directly into the spatial units that would be considered as building blocks for a reserve system. We present results of our patch building heuristic method for planning data from California. 1361:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A common approach used to estimate landscape resistance involves comparing correlations of ecological and genetic distances calculated among individuals of a species. However the location of sampled individuals may contain some degree of spatial uncertainty due to the natural variation of animals moving through their home range or measurement error in plant or animal locations. In this study we evaluate the ways that spatial uncertainty landscape characteristics and genetic stochasticity interact to influence the strength and variability of conclusions about landscape genetics relationships. We used a neutral landscape model to generate 45 landscapes composed of habitat and non habitat varying in percent habitat aggregation and structural connectivity (patch cohesion). We created true and alternate locations for 500 individuals calculated ecological distances (least cost paths) and simulated genetic distances among individuals. We compared correlations between ecological distances for true and alternate locations. We then simulated genotypes at 15 neutral loci and investigated whether the same influences could be detected in simple Mantel tests and while controlling for the effects of isolation by distance using the partial Mantel test. Spatial uncertainty interacted with the percentage of habitat in the landscape but led to only small reductions in correlations. Furthermore the strongest correlations occurred with low percent habitat high aggregation and low to intermediate levels of cohesion. Overall genetic stochasticity was relatively low and was influenced by landscape characteristics. 1363:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Forest bird species exhibit noticeable seasonal behavioral changes that might lead to contrasting effects of landscape pattern upon species abundance and performance. We assessed if the effect of patch and habitat attributes on the landscape use of thorn tailed rayaditos (Aphrastura spinicauda) a forest bird in a relict patchy forest in northern Chile varied temporally in association with changes in the behavior of individuals linked to breeding vs. non breeding conditions. We also assessed the relationship between nest success and patch and habitat attributes as nest success might be associated to the density rayaditos during the breeding season. We found that density of rayaditos was affected by patch size and functional connectivity but not by habitat structure and that the magnitude of the effect of patch size was greater during the non breeding season thus supporting the existence of a temporally variable effect of landscape pattern. Similarly the nest success of rayaditos was positively affected by functional connectivity and negatively by structural connectivity. We hypothesize that these results emerged from the interaction among territorial behavior resource limitation and predation risk. Despite the variable intensity of the effect of patch size upon density however this landscape attribute in addition to connectivity is essential for the persistence of rayaditos at this relict patchy forest landscapes. 1364:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In fragmented landscapes plant species persistence depends on functional connectivity in terms of pollen flow to maintain genetic diversity within populations and seed dispersal to re colonize habitat patches following local extinction. Connectivity in plants is commonly modeled as a function of the physical distance between patches without testing alternative dispersal vectors. In addition pre and post dispersal processes such as seed production and establishment are likely to affect patch colonization rates. Here we test alternative models of potential functional connectivity with different assumptions on source patch effects (patch area and species occupancy) and dispersal (relating to distance among patches matrix composition and sheep grazing routes) against empirical patch colonization rates at the community level (actual functional connectivity) accounting for post dispersal effects in terms of structural elements providing regeneration niches for establishment. Our analyses are based on two surveys in 1989 and in 2009 of 48 habitat specialist plants in 62 previously abandoned calcareous grassland patches in the Southern Franconian Alb in Bavaria Germany. The best connectivity model S i as identified by multi model inference combined distance along sheep grazing routes including consistently and intermittently grazed patches with mean species occupancy in 1989 as a proxy for pre dispersal effects. Community level patch colonization rates depended to equal degrees on connectivity and post dispersal process. Our study highlights that actual functional connectivity of calcareous grassland communities cannot be approximated by structural connectivity based on physical distance alone and modeling of functional connectivity needs to consider pre and post dispersal processes. 1365:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pattern in ecological landscapes is often the result of different processes operating at different scales. Neutral landscape models were introduced in landscape ecology to differentiate patterns that are the result of simple random processes from patterns that arise from more complex ecological processes. Recent studies have used increasingly complex neutral models that incorporate contagion and other constraints on random patterns as well as using neutral landscapes as input to spatial simulation models. Here I consider a common mathematical framework based on spectral transforms that represents all neutral landscape models in terms of sets of spectral basis functions. Fractal and multi fractal models are considered as well as models with multiple scaling regions and anisotropy. All of the models considered are shown to be variations on a basic theme: a scaling relation between frequency and amplitude of spectral components. Two example landscapes examined showed long range correlations (distances up to 1000 km) consistent with fractal scaling. 1376:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The distribution of organisms can be regulated by local environmental factors and regional processes such as dispersal. Here we review recent work on the role of dispersal for generating population and community structure in freshwater zooplankton. We examine evidence for different mechanisms of dispersal among lakes for the effects of dispersal limitations on populations and communities and for the effects of spatial scale on dispersal rates. Zooplankton move via human or animal vectors flowing surface waters and wind; the relative importance of the different modes of transport is poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that dispersal among lakes separated over short spatial scales ( 10 km) is sufficiently rapid that local interactions should limit species diversity and composition more than the supply of colonists. However dispersal limitation over broad scales (tens to thousands of kilometers) might constrain geographic ranges and influence community structure. The current explosion in the incidence of exotic species indicates that such global or continental scale dispersal was limiting in the past. The spread of exotic species also provides opportunities to study the scale dependence of zooplankton dispersal. We show how patterns of range expansion can be used to estimate the change in invasion likelihood with distance to a source population. Such dispersal functions provide a crucial link between small scale experimental studies and broad scale geographic patterns. 1413:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A major challenges facing landscape geneticists studying adaptive variation is to include all the environmental variables that might be correlated with allele frequencies across the genome. One way of identifying loci that are possibly under selection is to see which ones are associated with environmental gradient or heterogeneity. Since it is difficult to measure all environmental variables one may take advantage of the spatial nature of environmental filters to incorporate the effect of unaccounted environmental variables in the analysis. Assuming that the spatial signature of these variables is broad scaled broad scale Morans eigenvector maps (MEM) can be included as explanatory variables in the analysis as proxies for unmeasured environmental variables. We applied this approach to two data sets of the alpine plant Arabis alpina. The first consisted of 140 AFLP loci sampled at 130 sites across the European Alps (large scale). The second one consisted of 712 AFLP loci sampled at 93 sites (regional scale) in three mountain massifs (local scale) of the French Alps. For each scale we regressed the frequencies of each AFLP allele on a set of eco climatic and MEM variables as predictors. Twelve (large scale) and 11 PeRcEnT (regional scale) of all loci were detected as significantly correlated to at least one of the predictors (R(adj)(2)   0.5) and except for one massif 17 PeRcEnT at the local scale. After accounting for spatial effects temperature and precipitation were the two major determinants of allele distributions. Our study shows how MEM models can account for unmeasured environmental variation in landscape genetics models. 1414:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Analyses of historical samples can provide invaluable information on changes to the genetic composition of natural populations resulting from human activities. Here we analyse 21 microsatellite loci in historical (archived scales from 1927 to 1956) and contemporary samples of brown trout (Salmo trutta) from six neighbouring rivers in Denmark to compare the genetic structure of wild populations before and after population declines and stocking with nonlocal strains of hatchery trout. We show that all populations have been strongly affected by stocking with admixture proportions ranging from 14 to 64 PeRcEnT. Historical population genetic structure was characterized by isolation by distance and by positive correlations between historical effective population sizes and habitat area within river systems. Contemporary population genetic structure still showed isolation by distance but also reflected differences among populations in hatchery trout admixture proportions. Despite significant changes to the genetic composition within populations over time dispersal rates among populations were roughly similar before and after stocking. We also assessed whether population declines or introgression by hatchery strain trout should be the most significant conservation concern in this system. Based on theoretical considerations we argue that population declines have had limited negative effects for the persistence of adaptive variation but admixture with hatchery trout may have resulted in reduced local adaptation. Collectively our study demonstrates the usefulness of analysing historical samples for identifying the most important consequences of human activities on the genetic structure of wild populations. 1415:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Evolutionary processes are routinely modelled using ideal Wright Fisher populations of constant size N in which each individual has an equal expectation of reproductive success. In a hypothetical ideal population variance in reproductive success (V(k)) is binomial and effective population size (N(e)) equals N. However in any actual implementation of the Wright Fisher model (e. g. in a computer) V(k) is a random variable and its realized value in any given replicate generation (V(k) ) only rarely equals the binomial variance. Realized effective size (N(e) ) thus also varies randomly in modelled ideal populations and the consequences of this have not been adequately explored in the literature. Analytical and numerical results show that random variation V(k) and N(e) can seriously distort analyses that evaluate precision or otherwise depend on the assumption that N(e) is constant. We derive analytical expressions for Var(V(k)) 4(2N 1)(N 1) N(3) and Var(N(e)) N(N 1) (2N 1) approximate to N 2 in modelled ideal populations and show that for a genetic metric G equals f(N(e)) Var((G) over cap) has two components: Var(Gene) (due to variance across replicate samples of genes given a specific N(e) ) and Var(Demo) (due to variance N(e) ). Var((G) over cap) is higher than it would be with constant Ne equals N as implicitly assumed by many standard models. We illustrate this with empirical examples based on F (standardized variance of allele frequency) and r(2) (a measure of linkage disequilibrium). Results demonstrate that in computer models that track multilocus genotypes methods of replication and data analysis can strongly affect consequences of variation in N(e) . These effects are more important when sampling error is small (large numbers of individuals loci and alleles) and with relatively small populations (frequently modelled by those interested in conservation). 1416:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Landscape features exist at multiple spatial and temporal scales and these naturally affect spatial genetic structure and our ability to make inferences about gene flow. This article discusses how decisions about sampling of genotypes (including choices about analytical methods and genetic markers) should be driven by the scale of spatial genetic structure the time frame that landscape features have existed in their current state and all aspects of a species life history. Researchers should use caution when making inferences about gene flow especially when the spatial extent of the study area is limited. The scale of sampling of the landscape introduces different features that may affect gene flow. Sampling grain should be smaller than the average home range size or dispersal distance of the study organism and for raster data existing research suggests that simplifying the thematic resolution into discrete classes may result in low power to detect effects on gene flow. Therefore the methods used to characterize the landscape between sampling sites may be a primary determinant for the spatial scale at which analytical results are applicable and the use of only one sampling scale for a particular statistical method may lead researchers to overlook important factors affecting gene flow. The particular analytical technique used to correlate landscape data and genetic data may also influence results; common landscape genetic methods may not be suitable for all study systems particularly when the rate of landscape change is faster than can be resolved by common molecular markers. 1417:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Landscape genetics has seen rapid growth in number of publications since the term was coined in 2003. An extensive literature search from 1998 to 2008 using keywords associated with landscape genetics yielded 655 articles encompassing a vast array of study organisms study designs and methodology. These publications were screened to identify 174 studies that explicitly incorporated at least one landscape variable with genetic data. We systematically reviewed this set of papers to assess taxonomic and temporal trends in: (i) geographic regions studied; (ii) types of questions addressed; (iii) molecular markers used; (iv) statistical analyses used; and (v) types and nature of spatial data used. Overall studies have occurred in geographic regions proximal to developed countries and more commonly in terrestrial vs. aquatic habitats. Questions most often focused on effects of barriers and or landscape variables on gene flow. The most commonly used molecular markers were microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLPs) with AFLPs used more frequently in plants than animals. Analysis methods were dominated by Mantel and assignment tests. We also assessed differences among journals to evaluate the uniformity of reporting and publication standards. Few studies presented an explicit study design or explicit descriptions of spatial extent. While some landscape variables such as topographic relief affected most species studied effects were not universal and some species appeared unaffected by the landscape. Effects of habitat fragmentation were mixed with some species altering movement paths and others unaffected. Taken together although some generalities emerged regarding effects of specific landscape variables results varied thereby reinforcing the need for species specific work. We conclude by: highlighting gaps in knowledge and methodology providing guidelines to authors and reviewers of landscape genetics studies and suggesting promising future directions of inquiry. 1418:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine species frequently show weak and or complex genetic structuring that is commonly dismissed as chaotic genetic patchiness and ecologically uninformative. Here using three datasets that individually feature weak chaotic patchiness we demonstrate that combining inferences across species and incorporating environmental data can greatly improve the predictive value of marine population genetics studies on small spatial scales. Significant correlations in genetic patterns of microsatellite markers among three species kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus Kellets whelk Kelletia kelletii and California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus in the Southern California Bight suggest that slight differences in diversity and pairwise differentiation across sampling sites are not simply noise or chaotic patchiness but are ecologically meaningful. To test whether interspecies correlations potentially result from shared environmental drivers of genetic patterns we assembled data on kelp bed size sea surface temperature and estimates of site to site migration probability derived from a high resolution multi year ocean circulation model. These data served as predictor variables in linear models of genetic diversity and linear mixed models of genetic differentiation that were assessed with information theoretic model selection. Kelp was the most informative predictor of genetics for all three species but ocean circulation also played a minor role for kelp bass. The shared patterns suggest a single spatial marine management strategy may effectively protect genetic diversity of multiple species. This study demonstrates the power of environmental and ecological data to shed light on weak genetic patterns and highlights the need for future focus on a mechanistic understanding of the links between oceanography ecology and genetic structure. 1419:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Measures of genetic structure among individuals or populations collected at different spatial locations across a landscape are commonly used as surrogate measures of functional  demographic or genetic) connectivity. In order to understand how landscape characteristics influence functional connectivity resistance surfaces are typically created in a raster GIS environment. These resistance surfaces represent hypothesized relationships between landscape features and gene flow and are based on underlying biological functions such as relative abundance or movement probabilities in different land cover types. The biggest challenge for calculating resistance surfaces is assignment of resistance values to different landscape features. Here we first identify study objectives that are consistent with the use of resistance surfaces and critically review the various approaches that have been used to parameterize resistance surfaces and select optimal models in landscape genetics. We then discuss the biological assumptions and considerations that influence analyses using resistance surfaces such as the relationship between gene flow and dispersal how habitat suitability may influence animal movement and how resistance surfaces can be translated into estimates of functional landscape connectivity. Finally we outline novel approaches for creating optimal resistance surfaces using either simulation or computational methods as well as alternatives to resistance surfaces  network and buffered paths). These approaches have the potential to improve landscape genetic analyses but they also create new challenges. We conclude that no single way of using resistance surfaces is appropriate for every situation. We suggest that researchers carefully consider objectives important biological assumptions and available parameterization and validation techniques when planning landscape genetic studies. 1420:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pollen dispersal is a critical process that shapes genetic diversity in natural populations of plants. Estimating the pollen dispersal curve can provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of populations and is essential background for making predictions about changes induced by perturbations. Specifically we would like to know whether the dispersal curve is exponential thin tailed (decreasing faster than exponential) or fat tailed (decreasing slower than the exponential). In the latter case rare events of long distance dispersal will be much more likely. Here we generalize the previously developed TWOGENER method assuming that the pollen dispersal curve belongs to particular one or two parameter families of dispersal curves and estimating simultaneously the parameters of the dispersal curve and the effective density of reproducing individuals in the population. We tested this method on simulated data using an exponential power distribution under thin tailed exponential and fat tailed conditions. We find that even if our estimates show some bias and large mean squared error (MSE) we are able to estimate correctly the general trend of the curve thin tailed or fat tailed and the effective density. Moreover the mean distance of dispersal can be correctly estimated with low bias and MSE even if another family of dispersal curve is used for the estimation. Finally we consider three case studies based on forest tree species. We find that dispersal is fat tailed in all cases and that the effective density estimated by our model is below the measured density in two of the cases. This latter result may reflect the difficulty of estimating two parameters or it may be a biological consequence of variance in reproductive success of males in the population. Both the simulated and empirical findings demonstrate the strong potential of TWOGENER for evaluating the shape of the dispersal curve and the effective density of the population (d(e)). 1421:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pollen is the dominant vector of gamete exchange for most temperate tree species. Because pollen movement influences the creation maintenance and erosion of genetic structure in adult populations it is important to understand what factors influence the process of pollen movement. Isolation by distance in pollen donor populations can create highly structured pollen polls by increased sampling of local fathers. Extrinsic factors such as the intervening vegetative structure and local pollen donor densities can also influence the genetic composition of local. pollen pools. Using paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers we examined the structure and diversity of pollen pools in Pinus echinata Mill. in southern Missouri USA. Our analysis is based on a multivariate AMOVA analysis of stands (approximate to1 ha; six per region) nested within regions (approximate to 800 ha; four each). Significant multilocus structure of the pollen pool within regions (phi (SR) equals 0.095) but not among regions (phi (RT) equals 0.010) indicates that pollen movement is relatively restricted. Furthermore the significant correlation between pairwise genetic and physical distances (Mantel correlation; rho equals 0.32) provided support for the isolation by distance hypothesis. Our results indicated that availability of pollen donors did not affect diversity of the pollen pool measured by the number of unique multilocus genotypes at each stand. However pollen pool diversity was negatively associated with vegetative structure measured as total forest tree density. Our findings indicated that on going pollen movement within continuous forest is relatively restricted as a result of both isolation by distance and vegetative structure. 1422:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Population genetics theory is primarily based on mathematical models in which spatial complexity and temporal variability are largely ignored. In contrast the field of landscape genetics expressly focuses on how population genetic processes are affected by complex spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. It is spatially explicit and relates patterns to processes by combining complex and realistic life histories behaviours landscape features and genetic data. Central to landscape genetics is the connection of spatial patterns of genetic variation to the usually highly stochastic space time processes that create them over both historical and contemporary time periods. The field should benefit from a shift to computer simulation approaches which enable incorporation of demographic and environmental stochasticity. A key role of simulations is to show how demographic processes such as dispersal or reproduction interact with landscape features to affect probability of site occupancy population size and gene flow which in turn determine spatial genetic structure. Simulations could also be used to compare various statistical methods and determine which have correct type I error or the highest statistical power to correctly identify spatio temporal and environmental effects. Simulations may also help in evaluating how specific spatial metrics may be used to project future genetic trends. This article summarizes some of the fundamental aspects of spatial temporal population genetic processes. It discusses the potential use of simulations to determine how various spatial metrics can be rigorously employed to identify features of interest including contrasting locus specific spatial patterns due to micro scale environmental selection. 1424:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although many properties of spatial autocorrelation statistics are well characterized virtually nothing is known about possible correlations among values at different spatial scales which ultimately would influence how inferences about spatial genetics are made at multiple spatial scales. This article reports the results of stochastic space time simulations of isolation by distance processes having a very wide range of amounts of dispersal for plants or animals and analyses of the correlations among Morans I statistics for different mutually exclusive distance classes. In general the stochastic correlations are extremely large (  0.90); however the correlations bear a complex relationship with level of dispersal spatial scale and spatial lag between distance classes. The correlations are so large that any existing or conceived statistical method that employs more than one distance class (or spatial scale) should not ignore them. This result also suggests that gains in statistical power via increasing sample size are limited and that increasing numbers of assayed loci generally should be preferred. To the extent that sampling error for real data sets can be treated as white noise it should be possible to account for stochastic correlations in formulating more precise statistical methods. Further while the current results are for isolation by distance processes they provide some guidance for some more complex stochastic space time processes of landscape genetics. Moreover the results hold for several popular measures other than Morans I. In addition in the results the signal to noise ratios strongly decreased with distance which also has several implications for optimal statistical methods using correlations at multiple spatial scales. 1425:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An important use of genetic parentage analysis is the ability to directly calculate the number of offspring produced by each parent (k(i)) and hence effective population size N(e). But what if parental genotypes are not available? In theory given enough markers it should be possible to reconstruct parental genotypes based entirely on a sample of progeny and if so the vector of parental k(i) values. However this would provide information only about parents that actually contributed offspring to the sample. How would ignoring the null parents (those that produced no offspring) affect an estimate of N(e)? The surprising answer is that null parents have no effect at all. We show that: (i) The standard formula for inbreeding N(e) can be rewritten so that it is a function only of sample size and Sigma(K(i)(2)); it is not necessary to know the total number of parents (N). This same relationship does not hold for variance N(e). (ii) This novel formula provides an unbiased estimate of N(e) even if only a subset of progeny is available provided the parental contributions are accurately determined in which case precision is also high compared to other single sample estimators of N(e). (iii) It is not necessary to actually reconstruct parental genotypes; from a matrix of pairwise relationships (as can be estimated by some current software programs) it is possible to construct the vector of k(i) values and estimate N(e). The new method based on parentage analysis without parents (PwoP) can potentially be useful as a single sample estimator of contemporary N(e) provided that either (i) relationships can be accurately determined or (ii) Sigma(K(i)(2)) can be estimated directly. 1428:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The concept of effective population size (N(e)) is based on an elegantly simple idea which however rapidly becomes very complex when applied to most real world situations. In natural populations spatial and temporal stratifications create different classes of individuals with different vital rates and this in turn affects (generally reduces) N(e) in complex ways. I consider how these natural stratifications influence our understanding of effective size and how to estimate it and what the consequences are for conservation and management of natural populations. Important points that emerge include the following: The relative influences of local vs metapopulation N(e) depend on a variety of factors including the time frame of interest. Levels of diversity in local populations are strongly influenced by even low levels of migration so these measures are not reliable indicators of local N(e). For long term effective size obtaining a reliable estimate of mutation rate is the most important consideration; unless this is accomplished estimates can be biased by orders of magnitude. At least some estimators of contemporary N(e) appear to be robust to relatively high (approximately 10 PeRcEnT) equilibrium levels of migration so under many realistic scenarios they might yield reliable estimates of local N(e). Age structure probably has little effect on long term estimators of N(e) but can strongly influence contemporary estimates. More research is needed in several key areas: (i) to disentangle effects of selection and drift in metapopulations connected by intermediate levels of migration; (ii) to elucidate the relationship between N(b) (effective number of breeders per year) and N(e) per generation in age structured populations; (iii) to perform rigorous sensitivity analyses of new likelihood and coalescent based methods for estimating demographic and evolutionary histories. 1431:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The influence of study design on the ability to detect the effects of landscape pattern on gene flow is one of the most pressing methodological gaps in landscape genetic research. To investigate the effect of study design on landscape genetics inference we used a spatially explicit individual based program to simulate gene flow in a spatially continuous population inhabiting a landscape with gradual spatial changes in resistance to movement. We simulated a wide range of combinations of number of loci number of alleles per locus and number of individuals sampled from the population. We assessed how these three aspects of study design influenced the statistical power to successfully identify the generating process among competing hypotheses of isolation by distance isolation by barrier and isolation by landscape resistance using a causal modelling approach with partial Mantel tests. We modelled the statistical power to identify the generating process as a response surface for equilibrium and non equilibrium conditions after introduction of isolation by landscape resistance. All three variables (loci alleles and sampled individuals) affect the power of causal modelling but to different degrees. Stronger partial Mantel r correlations between landscape distances and genetic distances were found when more loci were used and when loci were more variable which makes comparisons of effect size between studies difficult. Number of individuals did not affect the accuracy through mean equilibrium partial Mantel r but larger samples decreased the uncertainty (increasing the precision) of equilibrium partial Mantel r estimates. We conclude that amplifying more (and more variable) loci is likely to increase the power of landscape genetic inferences more than increasing number of individuals. 1436:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Fenders blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi Macy ) is an endangered butterfly found across 16 surviving remnants of native upland prairie in the Willamette Valley in Oregon USA. A member of the lycaenid group recent research suggests that the butterfly (a) is distinct from other subspecies in the L icarioides species complex (b) requires sufficient quantities of its larval food plant usually Kincaids lupine (Lupinus sulphureus spp. kincaidii Smith Phillips) and adult nectar resources; (c) as a result of limited dispersal abilities and habitat fragmentation has populations that are currently isolated from one another; (d) experiences high variation in population growth rate; and (e) has no populations that are at low risk of extinction. Recovery of this endangered species will require maintaining and restoring enough habitat to support viable populations of the butterfly throughout its range. These efforts should include stopping habitat loss managing existing habitat by reducing aggressive weeds enhancing nectar and food plant resources restoring networks of habitat to support viable populations and possibly developing a captive breeding program. 1485:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding spatial population dynamics is fundamental for many questions in ecology and conservation. Many theoretical mechanisms have been proposed whereby spatial structure can promote population persistence in particular for exploiter victim systems (host parasite pathogen predator prey) whose interactions are inherently oscillatory and therefore prone to extinction of local populations. Experiments have confirmed that spatial structure can extend persistence but it has rarely been possible to identify the specific mechanisms involved. Here we use a model based approach to identify the effects of spatial population processes in experimental systems of bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) herbivorous mites (Tetranychus urticae) and predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis). On isolated plants and in a spatially undivided experimental system of 90 plants prey and predator populations collapsed; however introducing habitat structure allowed long term persistence. Using mechanistic models we determine that spatial population structure did not contribute to persistence and spatially explicit models are not needed. Rather habitat structure reduced the success of predators at locating prey outbreaks allowing between plant asynchrony of local population cycles due to random colonization events. 149:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantifying the extent to which seed production is limited by the availability of pollen has been an area of intensive empirical study over the past few decades. Whereas theory predicts that pollen augmentation should not increase seed production numerous empirical studies report significant and strong pollen limitation. Here we use a variety of approaches to examine the correlates of pollen limitation in an effort to understand its occurrence and importance in plant evolutionary ecology. In particular we examine the role of recent ecological perturbations in influencing pollen limitation and discuss the relation between pollen limitation and plant traits. We find that the magnitude of pollen limitation observed in natural populations depends on both historical constraints and contemporary ecological factors. 151:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial synchrony refers to coincident changes in the abundance or other time varying characteristics of geographically disjunct populations. This phenomenon has been documented in the dynamics of species representing a variety of taxa and ecological roles. Synchrony may arise from three primary mechanisms: (a) dispersal among populations reducing the size of relatively large populations and increasing relatively small ones; (b) congruent dependence of population dynamics on a synchronous exogenous random factor such as temperature or rainfall a phenomenon known as the   Moran effect  ; and (c) trophic interactions with populations of other species that are themselves spatially synchronous or mobile. Identification of the causes of synchrony is often difficult. In addition to intraspecific synchrony there are many examples of synchrony among populations of different species the causes of which are similarly complex and difficult to identify. Furthermore some populations may exhibit complex spatial dynamics such as spiral waves and chaos. Statistical tests based on phase coherence and or time lagged spatial correlation are required to characterize these more complex patterns of spatial dynamics fully. 1529:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Communities of organisms form as a result of both interspecific and abiotic interactions within local habitat patches and dispersal among patches in a region. Local processes are expected to play a dominant role when dispersal occurs much more often than extinction. We performed two field experiments to examine rates and mechanisms of dispersal in freshwater pond zooplankton communities. First we tested the effect of distance from a source on the rate of colonization of artificial habitat by placing wading pools at 5 10 30 and 60 m from two natural fishless ponds and observing the succession of zooplankton. Seventy eight percent of the species in the source ponds that were capable of living in the pools colonized at least once during the experiment. A new species was found in the pools on average once every four days suggesting that colonization events occur on the order of days to weeks for many species. Colonization rates declined further from the source at one pond but not the other and the effect of distance was relatively weak at both ponds. This suggests that many species disperse broadly over short distances. The second experiment tested the role of animal vectors for zooplankton dispersal by restricting access to the pools. Eight treatments were imposed that excluded potential animal vectors along a body size gradient from large mammals to small insects. While the treatments affected zooplankton colonization many species invaded even when all animals larger than 1 mm were excluded. Animal vectors may therefore be less important for dispersal than wind. Our results suggest that zooplankton are highly effective dispersers over short distances and can disperse via several mechanisms. Local interactions should therefore play a dominant role in structuring these communities at small regional scales. 1546:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mast seeding the synchronous production of large crops of seeds has been frequently documented in oak species. In this study we used several North American oak data sets to quantify within stand ( 10 km) synchrony in mast dynamics. Results indicated that intraspecific synchrony in seed production always exceeded interspecific synchrony and was essentially constant over distances ranging from 100 m to 10 km. Asynchrony between species was at least partially attributable to differences in the endogenous dynamics in seed production caused by the varying numbers of years (1 or 2) required to mature seeds. Similarly the magnitude of intraspecific seed production synchrony was related to intraspecific variation in endogenous dynamics; this intraspecific variation could be caused by spatial variation in habitat conditions. These results indicate that both interspecific and intraspecific variation in the endogenous processes generating variability in seed production may influence the magnitude of spatial synchrony in total (all species) mast production. Such findings may be of significance to understanding interactions between synchrony in mast seeding and animal consumer populations. 163:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,164:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1685:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  The movement patterns of wild animals depend crucially on the spatial and temporal availability of resources in their habitat. To date most attempts to model this relationship were forced to rely on simplified assumptions about the spatiotemporal distribution of food resources. Here we demonstrate how advances in statistics permit the combination of sparse ground sampling with remote sensing imagery to generate biological relevant spatially and temporally explicit distributions of food resources. We illustrate our procedure by creating a detailed simulation model of fruit production patterns for Dipteryx oleifera a keystone tree species on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) Panama. Aerial photographs providing GPS positions for large canopy trees the complete census of a 50 ha and 25 ha area diameter at breast height data from haphazardly sampled trees and long term phenology data from six trees were used to fit 1) a point process model of tree spatial distribution and 2) a generalized linear mixed effect model of temporal variation of fruit production. The fitted parameters from these models are then used to create a stochastic simulation model which incorporates spatio temporal variations of D. oleifera fruit availability on BCI. We present a framework that can provide a statistical characterization of the habitat that can be included in agent based models of animal movements. When environmental heterogeneity cannot be exhaustively mapped this approach can be a powerful alternative. The results of our model on the spatio temporal variation in D. oleifera fruit availability will be used to understand behavioral and movement patterns of several species on BCI. 1689:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are the most important pollinators of many agricultural crops worldwide and are a key test species used in the tiered safety assessment of genetically engineered insect resistant crops. There is concern that widespread planting of these transgenic crops could harm honey bee populations. We conducted a meta analysis of 25 studies that independently assessed potential effects of Bt Cry proteins on honey bee survival (or mortality). Our results show that Bt Cry proteins used in genetically modified crops commercialized for control of lepidopteran and coleopteran pests do not negatively affect the survival of either honey bee larvae or adults in laboratory settings. Although the additional stresses that honey bees face in the field could in principle modify their susceptibility to Cry proteins or lead to indirect effects our findings support safety assessments that have not detected any direct negative effects of Bt crops for this vital insect pollinator. 168:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1724:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As pollinators decline globally competition for their services is expected to intensify and this antagonism may be most severe where the number of plant species is the greatest. Using meta analysis and comparative phylogenetic analysis we provide a global scale test of whether reproduction becomes more limited by pollen receipt (pollen limitation) as the number of coexisting plant species increases. As predicted we find a significant positive relationship between pollen limitation and species richness. in addition this pattern is particularly strong for species that are obligately outcrossing and for trees relative to herbs or shrubs. We suggest that plants occurring in species rich communities may be more prone to pollen limitation because of interspecific competition for pollinators. As a consequence plants in biodiversity hotspots may have a higher risk of extinction and or experience increased selection pressure to specialize on certain pollinators or diversify into different phenological niches. The combination of higher pollen limitation and habitat destruction represents a dual risk to tropical plant species that has not been previously identified. 1747:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Maintaining connectivity for broad scale ecological processes like dispersal and gene flow is essential for conserving endangered species in fragmented landscapes. However determining which habitats should be set aside to promote connectivity has been difficult because existing models cannot incorporate effects of multiple pathways linking populations. Here we test an ecological connectivity model that overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical circuit theory. The model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to data from threatened mammal and tree species the model consistently outperformed conventional gene flow models revealing that barriers were less important in structuring populations than previously thought. Circuit theory now provides the best justified method to bridge landscape and genetic data and holds much promise in ecology evolution and conservation planning. 1818:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Surprisingly little is known about the reproductive behaviour and breeding biology of most shark species especially in natural populations. Here we characterize reproductive patterns and use of a natal nursery at Bimini Bahamas by lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris. We systematically and exhaustively sampled young lemon sharks at Bimini annually from 1995 to 2000 and opportunistically sampled adults over the same period. Out of the 897 young sharks sampled 119 could be assigned to five sampled mothers using microsatellite genotyping. Reproductive females showed strong philopatry to the nursery returning to Bimini every two years to give birth. Each of these females may rely entirely on the Bimini nursery for recruitment. The protection of known nursery grounds should therefore figure prominently in conservation efforts for large coastal shark species. The reconstruction of paternal genotypes indicates that litters are sired by multiple males and females mate with different males nearly every breeding cycle. The ubiquitous polyandry reported here raises the possibility that genetic incompatibility and post copulatory paternity biasing mechanisms may operate in viviparous sharks. 1822:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The extent of our reliance on animal pollination for world crop production for human food has not previously been evaluated and the previous estimates for countries or continents have seldom used primary data. In this review we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However global production volumes give a contrasting perspective since 60 PeRcEnT of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination 35 PeRcEnT from crops that depend on pollinators and 5 PeRcEnT are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self pollinated wind pollinated or parthenocarpic we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops production is highly pollinator dependent for 30 moderately for 27 slightly for 21 unimportant for 7 and is of unknown significance for the remaining We further evaluated whether local and landscape wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale. 1828:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Two processes are universally recognized for inducing spatial synchrony in abundance: dispersal and correlated environmental stochasticity. In the present study we seek the expected relationship between synchrony and distance in populations that are synchronized by density independent dispersal. In the absence of dispersal synchrony among populations with simple dynamics has been shown to echo the correlation in the environment. We ask what functional form we may expect between synchrony and distance when dispersal is the synchronizing agent. We formulate a continuous space continuous time model that explicitly represents the time evolution of the spatial covariance as a function of spatial distance. Solving this model gives us two simple canonical functions for dispersal induced covariance in spatially extended populations. If dispersal is rare relative to birth and death then covariances between nearby points will follow the dispersal distance distribution. At long distances however the covariance tails off according to exponential or Bessel functions (depending on whether the population moves in one or two dimensions). If dispersal is common then the covariances will follow the mixture distribution that is approximately Gaussian around the origin and with an exponential or Bessel tail. The latter mixture results regardless of the original dispersal distance distribution. There are hence two canonical functions for dispersal induced synchrony. 1864:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The extent of genetic diversity in food crops is important as it affects the risk of attack by pathogens. A drop in diversity increases this risk. Farmers may not take this into account when making crop choices leading to what from a social perspective is an inadequate level of diversity. 1871:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A major goal of population biologists involved in restoration work is to restore populations to a level that will allow them to persist over the long term within a dynamic landscape and include the ability to undergo adaptive evolutionary change. We discuss five research areas of particular importance to restoration biology that offer potentially unique opportunities to couple basic research with the practical needs of restorationists. The five research areas are: (1) the influence of numbers of individuals and genetic variation in the initial population on population colonization establishment growth and evolutionary potential; (2) the role of local adaptation and life history traits In the success of restored populations; (3) the influence of the spatial arrangement of landscape elements on metapopulation dynamics and population processes such as migration; (4) the effects of genetic drift gene flow and selection on population persistence within an often accelerated successional time frame; and (5) the influence of interspecific interactions on population dynamics and community development. We also provide a sample of practical problems faced by practitioners each of which encompasses one or more of the research areas discussed and that may be solved by addressing fundamental research questions. 189:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1913:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Scientists have long viewed lakes as microcosms in which to study fundamental ecosystem processes. A large heterogeneous body of multidecadal data has been accumulated around the world documenting historical conditions capturing temporal dynamics of complex ecological phenomena that could not be observed within shorter time periods. Building on this legacy of long term data collection innovations in sensor applications and computing are creating new opportunities for integrating data across different scales in space and time enriching long term research and stimulating collaboration. 1942:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Habitat fragmentation is one of the largest threats to biodiversity. Landscape corridors which are hypothesized to reduce the negative consequences of fragmentation have become common features of ecological management plans worldwide. Despite their popularity there is little evidence documenting the effectiveness of corridors in preserving biodiversity at large scales. Using a large scale replicated experiment we showed that habitat patches connected by corridors retain more native plant species than do isolated patches that this difference increases over time and that corridors do not promote invasion by exotic species. Our results support the use of corridors in biodiversity conservation. 1964:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatially extended population models predict complex spatiotemporal patterns such as spiral waves and spatial chaos as a result of the reaction diffusion dynamics that arise from trophic interactions. However examples of such patterns in ecological systems are scarce. We develop a quantitative technique to demonstrate the existence of waves in Central European larch budmoth (Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) outbreaks. We show that these waves travel toward the northeast east at 210 kilometers per year. A theoretical model involving a moth enemy interaction predicts directional waves but only if dispersal is directionally biased or habitat productivity varies across the landscape. Our study confirms that nonlinear ecological interactions can lead to complex spatial dynamics at a regional scale. 198:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1999:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The objectives of the present study were to develop microsatellite markers for the wild strawberry Fragaria virginiana to evaluate segregation patterns of microsatellite alleles in this octoploid species and assess genetic variability at microsatellite loci in a wild population. A genomic library was screened for microsatellite repeats and several PCR primers were designed and tested. We also tested the use of heterologous primers and found that F. virginiana primers amplified products in cultivated strawberry Fragaria x ananassa Duch. and Fragaria chiloensis. Similarly microsatellite loci developed from cultivated strawberry also successfully amplified F. virginiana loci. We investigated four microsatellite loci in detail three developed from F. virginiana and one from cultivated strawberry. A survey of 100 individuals from a population of F. virginiana in Pennsylvania demonstrated high heterozygosities (H e or gene diversity ranged from 0.80 to 0.88 per locus) and allelic diversity (12 17 alleles per locus) but individual plants had no more than two alleles per locus. Segregation patterns in parents and progeny of two controlled crosses at these four loci were consistent with disomic Mendelian inheritance. Together these findings suggest that the genome of F. virginiana is highly diploidized and at least a subset of microsatellite loci can be treated as codominant diploid markers. Significant heterozygote deficiencies were found at three of the four loci for hermaphroditic individuals but for only one locus among females in this gynodioecious species. 19:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Anthropogenic landscape change can disrupt gene flow. As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project this study examined whether silvicultural practices influence pollen mediated gene movement in the insect pollinated species Cornus florida L. by comparing pollen pool structure (Phi(st)) among clear cutting selective cutting and uncut regimes with the expectation that pollen movement should be least in the uncut regime. Using a sample of 1500 seedlings 10 each from 150 seed parents (43 in clear cut 74 in selective and 33 in control sites) from six sites (each ranging from 266 to 527 ha) eight allozyme loci were analyzed with a pollen pool structure approach known as TWOGENER (Smouse . 2001; Evolution 55: 260 271). This analysis revealed that pollen pool structure was less in clear cut ((Phi) over circle (C) equals 0.090 P   0.001) than in uncut areas ((Phi) over cap (U) equals 0.174 P   0.001) with selective cut intermediate ((Phi) over circles equals 0.125 P   0.001). These estimates translate into more effective pollen donors (N(ep)) in clear cut (N(ep) equals 5.56) and selective cut (N(ep) equals 4.00) areas than in uncut areas (N(ep) equals 2.87). We demonstrate that Phi(C) less than or equal to Phi(S) less than or equal to Phi(U) with (Phi) over circle (C) significantly smaller than (Phi) over circle (U) (P   0.034). The findings imply that as long as a sufficiently large number of seed parents remain to provide adequate reproduction and to avoid a genetic bottleneck in the effective number of mothers silvicultural management may not negatively affect the effective number of pollen parents and hence subsequent genetic diversity in Cornus florida. 2011:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial extent can have two important consequences for population dynamics: It can generate spatial structure in which individuals interact more intensely with neighbors than with more distant conspecifics and it allows for environmental heterogeneity in which habitat quality varies spatially. Studies of these features are difficult to interpret because the models are complex and sometimes idiosyncratic. Here we analyze one of the simplest possible spatial population models to understand the mathematical basis for the observed patterns: two patches coupled by dispersal with dynamics in each patch governed by the logistic map. With suitable choices of parameters this model can represent spatial structure environmental heterogeneity or both in combination. We synthesize previous work and new analyses on this model with two goals: to provide a comprehensive baseline to aid our understanding of more complex spatial models and to generate predictions about the effects of spatial structure and environmental heterogeneity on population dynamics. Spatial structure alone can generate positive negative or zero spatial correlations between patches when dispersal rates are high medium or low relative to the complexity of the local dynamics. It can also lead to quasiperiodicity and hyperchaos which are not present in the nonspatial model. With density independent dispersal spatial structure cannot destabilize equilibria or periodic orbits that would be stable in the absence of space. When densities in the two patches are uncorrelated the probability that the population in a patch reaches extreme low densities is reduced relative to the same patch in isolation; this   rescue effect   would reduce the probability of metapopulation extinction beyond the simple effect of spreading of risk. 2012:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The concept of marine reserves as a method of improving management of fisheries is gaining momentum. While the list of benefits from reserves is frequently promoted precise formulations of theory to support reserve design are not fully developed. To determine the size of reserves and the distances between reserves an understanding of the requirements for persistence of local populations is required. Unfortunately conditions for persistence are poorly characterized as are the larval dispersal patterns on which persistence depends. With the current paucity of information regarding meroplanktonic larval transport processes understanding the robustness of theoretical results to larval dispersal is of key importance. From this formulation a broad range of dispersal patterns are analyzed. Larval dispersal is represented by a probability distribution that defines the fraction of successful settlers from an arbitrary location the origin of the distribution to any other location along the coast. While the effects of specific dispersal patterns have been investigated for invasion processes critical habitat size and persistence issues have generally been addressed with only one or two dispersal types. To that end we formulate models based on integrodifference equations that are spatially continuous and temporally discrete. We consider a range of dispersal distributions from leptokurtic to platykurtic. The effect of different dispersal patterns is considered for a single isolated reserve of varying size receiving no external larvae as well as multiple reserves with varying degrees of connectivity. While different patterns result in quantitative differences in persistence qualitatively similar effects across all patterns are seen in both single and multiple reserve models. Persistence in an isolated reserve requires a size that is approximately twice the mean dispersal distance and regardless of the dispersal pattern the population in a patch is not persistent if the reserve size is reduced to just the mean dispersal distance. With an idealized coastline structure consisting of an infinite line of equally spaced reserves separated by regions of coastline in which reproduction is nil the relative settlement as a function of the fraction of coastline and size of reserve is qualitatively very similar over a broad range of dispersal patterns. The upper limit for the minimum fraction of coastline held in reserve is about 40 PeRcEnT. As the fraction of coastline is reduced the minimum size of reserve becomes no more than 1.25 times the mean dispersal distance. 201:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,2022:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In the past few years a lot of attention has focused on the study of deterministic spatiotemporal models of interacting populations. In this framework space is modeled as a continuum or as a discrete lattice of sites or patches and populations interact and disperse to nearby areas. One of the most fascinating and moldbreaking findings has been the discovery of self organized spatiotemporal patterns such as spiral waves spatial chaos crystal lattices and Turing structures. Thus even when the habitat is homogeneous populations become scattered over space in a heterogeneous patchy distribution. These results have suggested that part of the complexity we observe in nature can have simple and deterministic originsz. Critics have pointed out that these spatiotemporal patterns might be an artefact arising from the simplicity of the models. It has been proved however that spatial self organization persists even when stochastic terms are incorporatedg. In fact small amounts of noise are essential for the formation and maintenance of spatial patterns in some  An additional line of evidence comes from a radically different modeling approach: individual oriented simulations have shown spatially heterogeneous distributions in population abundance arising from initially homogeneous settings. Specific examples are spiral waves and target  These findings are important because microscopic fluctuations at the individual level could destroy any spatial coherence. With these theoretical advances the stage was set to explore the occurrence of spatial patterns in the real world: is there anything out there? Reaction diffusion models and a host parasitoid system have confirmed the theoretical predictions by finding empirical evidence of patchy distributions within continuous habitats. Maron and Harrisonii focused on a host parasitoid system; the dynamics of the western tussock moth (Orgyiu uetustu) and its natural enemies. Tussock moths have a highly patchy distribution despite the continuous abundance of their resource. The low mobility of tussock moths their high parasitism rates and the high mobility of the parasitoids all suggest that patchiness may be a result of selforganized pattern formation as predicted by Turing theory. In reaction diffusion models pattern is formed because small deviations from a homogeneous distribution are amplified by a positive feedback (autocatalysis). This local self enhancement is linked to a longrange antagonistic effect that restricts the outbreak and prevents another outbreak from being formed close to the previous onela. The concentrations of activator (prey) and inhibitor (predator) are highest within the outbreak and decrease from the center of the peak towards the exterior. However the inhibitor diffuses faster and its distribution over space is wider so the ratio of inhibitor abundance:activator abundance increases when moving outwards from the center of the peak. In agreement with these theoretical predictions there was a minimum distance between the outbreaks of the tussock moths while parasitism rates (which provide an index of the ratio between tussock moths and their parasitoids) increased from the center of the outbreak until some distance was reached decreasing thereafter. In a further test of the robustness of the reported pattern  that distance dependent parasitism can prevent new outbreaks emerging near previous ones) Maron and Harrison created artificial outbreaks (by introducing larvae from previously collected eggs) in bushes at different distances from the outbreak of the previous year. In the jargon of reaction diffusion theory they wished to demonstrate the existence of long range lateral inhibition by using perturbation analysis. After testing that parasitism was the main source of larvae mortality they monitored the temporal evolution of the outbreaks. Population growth was suppressed at short distances from the natural outbreaks and increased (via a reduction in parasitism rate) at further distances. This provides clear evidence for self organized pattern formation. The lynx cycles revisited In the second paper Ranta . studied the synchrony in population fluctuations of the Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis) from eight Canadian provinces. Lynx not only show well defined 10 l l year cycles but also a surprising amount of synchronization over space. Two important results of this study provide indirect evidence of spatiotemporal patterns. First correlation in population fluctuations spans over large distances suggesting the existence of large scale spatial structures. For the lynx time series the degree of synchrony can decrease with distance. Ranta the plot synchrony versus distance  synchrony initially decreases with distance and then increases) for other species such as the snowshoe hare (the main prey of lynx). This pattern is compatible with different spatial structures such as a traveling wave. Second the relationship between correlation and distance changes when we look at different segments (temporal windows) of the temporal series which suggests that such patterns are dynamic; they change through time. Both observations are accurately predicted by a simple spatially explicit model developed by the authors. The model is a matrix of arbitrarily located populations with local dynamics described by Moran Ricker rules. Such populations are linked by distance dependent dispersal. This model also shows an interesting property that is related to the variation in synchrony over time. Local population cycles persisting for long periods can suddenly fade away but later recover. Interestingly these shifts in temporal dynamics are present in the lynx temporal series. These transitions between different dynamic states would traditionally have been associated with variations in some parameters but this case clearly shows that the same underlying mechanism can produce two very different outputs. Theoretical perspectives Additional insight into this last prob lem comes from recent theoretical worksJO. Spontaneous shifts between different spatial patterns  spiral waves and concentric waves) have been reported for both a deterministic host pathogen coupled map lattices and for a more detailed individual oriented simulationlo. Owing to the close relationship between space and time these shifts are associated with a qualitative change of dynamics (intermittency ). In other words it is the very nature of the spatial organization that is able to induce drastic changes in the amplitude frequency and coherence of the cycles. This result expands the notion of supertransience the extremely large temporal evolution needed for a spatially extended dynamic system to converge into the attractorl5. It has been suggested that transient dynamics may be more relevant than long term dynamics which leads to a reconsideration of the traditional approach focused on equilibria . Not only can the transients be extremely large with spatiotemporal intermittency but there is also no characteristic single attractor. In summary these two papers provide pioneering empirical evidence of the kind of self organization suggested by theory. Further studies will be very useful in confirming the generality of the recent theoretical predictions. In particular new statistical methods to detect and classify endogenous self organization in spatially distributed data would be paramount in achieving this goal. The recent surge of interest in the role of space in the persistence and stability of populations has provided a spate of new theory. New stages in our understanding of the ecological processes can only arise from a fertile interaction between theory and data.  2042:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Growing interest in metapopulation dynamics and dispersal at a landscape level is promoting new approaches to the study of contemporary gene flow. These approaches have been fostered by the development of new genetic markers and statistical methods as well as an awareness that contemporary gene flow cannot be reliably estimated by conventional methods based on genetic structure. Estimation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of:pollen and seed movement with respect to extant landscape features can aid evolutionary and conservation biologists in predicting the demographic and genetic responses of species to naturally occurring or human mediated population subdivision. 2055:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pollinators are a key component of global biodiversity providing vital ecosystem services to crops and wild plants.

Here we describe the nature and extent of reported declines and review the potential drivers of pollinator loss including habitat loss and fragmentation agrochemicals pathogens alien species climate change and the interactions between them. Pollinator declines can result in loss of pollination services which have important negative ecological and economic impacts that could significantly affect the maintenance of wild plant diversity wider ecosystem stability crop production food security and human welfare. 2066:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The search for mechanisms behind spatial population synchrony is currently a major issue in population ecology. Theoretical studies highlight how synchronizing mechanisms such as dispersal regionally correlated climatic variables and mobile enemies might interact with local dynamics to produce different patterns of spatial covariance. Specialized statistical methods applied to large scale survey data aid in testing the theoretical predictions with empirical estimates. Observational studies and experiments on the demography of local populations are paramount to identify the true ecological mechanisms. The recent achievements illustrate the power of combining theory observation and or experimentation and statistical modeling in the ecological research protocol. 2069:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Landscape genetics is the amalgamation of landscape ecology and population genetics to help with understanding microevolutionary processes such as gene flow and adaptation. In this review we examine why landscape genetics of plants lags behind that of animals both in number of studies and consideration of landscape elements. The classical landscape distance resistance approach to study gene flow is challenging in plants whereas boundary detection and the assessment of contemporary gene flow are more feasible. By contrast the new field of landscape genetics of adaptive genetic variation establishing the relationship between adaptive genomic regions and environmental factors in natural populations is prominent in plant studies. Landscape genetics is ideally suited to study processes such as migration and adaptation under global change. 210:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,217:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ability to predict the responses of ecological communities and individual species to human induced environmental change remains a key issue for ecologists and conservation managers alike. Responses are often variable among species within groups making general predictions difficult. One option is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this   trait guild   approach has been used for single disturbances the importance of particular traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test the effect of ecological and life history traits on the responses of bee species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These changes included habitat loss fragmentation agricultural intensification pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests above vs. below ground significantly affected response to habitat loss agricultural intensification tillage regime (within agriculture) and fire. Species that nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In contrast below ground nesting species were more negatively affected by tilling than were above ground nesters. The response of different nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn. Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly body size did not consistently affect species responses despite its importance in determining many aspects of individuals interaction with their environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of related species to global change. 22:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Our understanding of pollen limitation depends on a realistic view of its magnitude. Previous reviews of pollen supplementation experiments concluded that a majority of plant species suffers from pollen limitation and that its magnitude is high. Here we perform a meta analysis and find evidence that publication bias experimental design and the response variable chosen all influence the magnitude of pollen limitation. Fail safe numbers indicate that publication bias exists for some measures of pollen limitation; significant results are more likely to be published and therefore available for review. Moreover experiments conducted on only a fraction of a plants flowers and reproductive episodes report similar to 8 fold higher effect sizes than those on all flowers produced over the entire lifetime likely because resource reallocation among flowers and across years contributes to estimates of pollen limitation. Studies measuring percentage fruit set report higher values of pollen limitation than those measuring other response variables such as seeds per fruit perhaps because many plant species will not produce fruits unless adequate pollen receipt occurs to fertilize most ovules. We offer suggestions for reducing the bias introduced by methodology in pollen supplementation experiments and discuss our results in the context of optimality theory. 231:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the processes that maintain diversity has been the focus of extensive study yet there is much that has not been integrated into a cohesive framework. First there is a separation of perspective. Ecological and evolutionary approaches to diversity have progessed in largely parallel directions. Second there is a separation of emphasis. In both ecology and population genetics classical theories favour local explanations with emphasis on population dynamics and selection within populations while contemporary theories favour spatial explanations with emphasis on population structure and interactions among populations. What is lacking is a comparative approach that evaluates the relative importance of local and spatial processes in maintaining genetic and ecological diversity. I present a framework for diversity maintenance that emphasizes the comparative approach. I use a well known but little used mathematical approach the perturbation theorem for dynamical systems to identify key points of contact between ecological and population genetic theories of coexistence. These connections provide for a synthesis of several important concepts: population structure (source sink versus extinction colonization) spatial heterogeneity (intrinsic versus extrinsic) in fitness and competitive ability and temporal scales over which local and spatial processes influence diversity. This framework ties together a large and diverse body of theory and data from ecology and population genetics. It yields comparative predictions that can serve as guidelines in biodiversity management. 249:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biologists have long regarded the natural dispersal of large seeds as an impediment to plant range expansion after glacial periods. Global maps predicting biome distributions under future climate change scenarios  VEMAP 1995) are now prompting ecologists to think about the dispersal problem: If rapid climate change or habitat destruction remove sizable portions of a plants rnge will seed dispersal allow colonization of distant areas that may become favorable? Dispersal and population spread is a continusing theme of paleoecological research and it has demonstrated empirical migration rates that are three orders of magnitude faster than Clement Reids estimate. Tree populations migrated rapidly after most recent glcial period which suggests that they might do so again if climate were to change rapidly in the future. However the leap from late glacial warming to greenhouse warming of anthrogenic landscapes is broad. Estimates of future migration rates cannot be taken directly from paleoecological records but they might be sharpened by an understanding of how life history and dispersal affected past migrations. A plausible explanation for how rapid migrations were achieved in the past can guide forecasts for tree populations in the twenty first century. Although the rapid rates implied by past records bode well for plant populations themselves the rates are far too hight to have been produced by the dispersal mechanisms that are embodied in the traditional notions of tree life history and restricted dispersal. We call this dilemma of rapid migration Reids Paradox as voiced by him in the opening quotation. Explaining rapid migration has challenged paleoecologists for a century and remains a point of debate. New insights gained from dispersal theory hold promis not only for understanding some of the intriguing events of the past but also for anticipating changes to come. A recent workshop held at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara California concluded that elements of a solution to Reids Paradox can be gleaned from recent advances in the mathematical modeling of dispersal. Model populations disperse seeds according to a broad class of dispersal   kernels    which are functional shapes that describe the scatter of dispersed seed away from the parent tree. Although dispersal theory begun to converge toward new interpretations of how dispersal can contribute to the rate and variability of an expanding population fron. Reids Paradox serves as an instructive example not only of advances beyond traditional views of diffusion but also of the value of dialogue among disciplines sharing complementary goals. 24:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,257:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,269:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological research on organism environment interactions has developed asymmetrically. Modulation of organisms by the environment has received much attention while theoretical studies on the environmental impact of organisms have until recently been limited. Ive propose a theoretical framework for studying the environmental impacts of woody plants in order to understand their effects on biodiversity We adopt pattern formation theory to discuss how woody plants organize ecological systems on the patch and landscape levels through patch formation and how organism patchiness creates resource patchiness that affects biodiversity. Me suggest an integrative model that links organisms as landscape modulators through resource distribution and species filtering from larger to smaller spatial scales. Our   biodiversity cycling hypothesis   states that in organism modulated landscapes disturbance enables the coexistence of different developmental stages of vegetation patches thereby increasing biodiversity. This hypothesis emphasizes that species and landscape diversity vary with the development renewal maturation and decay of biotically induced patches. 291:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,300:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,302:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Geographical surveys of genetic variation provide an indirect means of tracing movements made between marine populations by larvae and other propagules. Genetic markers can provide strong evidence that populations are closed (self recruiting) because genetic differentiation is highly sensitive to migration. However inferences based on genetic data must necessarily be based on models that make assumptions concerning inheritance selective neutrality of markers and equilibrium between genetic drift migration and mutation. We briefly introduce the types of genetic markers that can be used to infer demographic connections between populations and the forces causing evolutionary changes in these markers and then we outline six patterns revealed by geographic surveys of genetic markers in marine species. Four of these patterns represent the possible combinations of high or low migration rates and large or small effective population sizes; two others are due to history and natural selection. Future genetic surveys should include more detailed spatial and temporal sampling and employ analyses of DNA sequence data that can reveal the signatures of natural selection and historical changes. 308:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantifying larval retention and connectivity remains a major hurdle in the development of realistic spatially explicit population models in marine systems. This lack of knowledge is primarily due to the difficulty of conducting mark recapture studies in species that are characterized by the production of large numbers of small pelagic offspring that suffer high initial mortality rates. Advances in artificial and natural tagging methodologies have however significantly increased the ability of marine ecologists to track larvae throughout the pelagic larval phase and subsequent recruitment into benthic populations. Many of these empirical approaches are now possible with the development of DNA sequencing and mass spectrometric instrumentation in the last decade. The presence of artificial tags in recaptured individuals remains the only unequivocal method for marking marine larvae. However the difficulties of tagging sufficient numbers of larvae with negligible handling effects are formidable. Natural tags including genetic markers and geochemical signatures in calcified tissues are rarely unique indicators of source location but have a significant advantage because all larvae released from an area are indelibly tagged Given the strengths and limitations of the techniques an approach that combines two or more techniques will likely be necessary to quantify larval retention and connectivity over appropriate spatio temporal scales. Where possible such a multi technique strategy should include both artificial and natural tags. 348:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,349:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,354:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, From the perspective of most animals fragmentation is a landscape scale process in which habitat is separated into many smaller patches that have less total area. Here we examine how two contemporary drivers of fragmentation anthropogenic climate change and exurbanization affect movement and responses of animal species to new environmental conditions. We address the definition of fragmentation and how the spatial patterns created by fragmentation can be measured at the scales at which different species of animals respond to their environments. We discuss tools such as satellite remote sensing that increasingly make it possible to identify and quantify changes in land cover and vegetation structure across extensive areas. We also describe a range of methods that are available to guide decisions about faunal surveys and monitoring programs in fragments or reference areas. Examination of stochastic changes in land cover and species occurrence over time is important because these shifts can confound detection of systematic responses to fragmentation. Careful evaluation of fragmentation and its influence on the distribution and viability of fauna may help to identify underlying mechanisms and to develop effective strategies for conservation and land use. 35:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,364:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,36:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A positive correlation between the sizes of plants and the sizes of their nearest neighbors has been observed in many plant populations and is most often attributed to variation in microsite quality. We demonstrate another potentially important cause using a simple spatial simulation model in which a plants size is determined by its available area plus stochastic variation. If the spatial arrangement of individuals is nonuniform and local crowding reduces individual size a positive correlation between the size of a plant and the size of neighboring individuals is to be expected. If a plant is small because it is crowded its nearest neighbors will also tend to be crowded and therefore small. Such positive correlations will be observed whenever any trait of an object is related to the area available to it. Looking at the performance of neighboring objects without explicitly considering distance can give a very misleading signal. 388:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As the focus of conservation biology shifts toward multispecies and ecosystem conservation and management a principal question becomes how we manage species to conserve their long term evolutionary potential. Few criteria exist for prioritizing which populations within a species should be protected to conserve maximal genetic variation. We designed this study to explore the genetic consequences of using population density as a criterion for selecting populations of woody plant species for conservation. Population density may be an effective gauge of genetic variation for two reasons. First density often reflects ecological population size particularly for continuously distributed species and density is much easier to measure in the field than population size. Second from an individual species perspective population density may be an indicator of habitat quality. We evaluated the relationship between standard genetic diversity indices and densities of seedlings small trees and large trees and we investigated the association between genotypic composition and density measures with canonical correlation analysis for three common tree species (Carya tomentosa Sassafras albidum and Quercus alba) from the Missouri Ozarks. We found that population density was not correlated with genetic diversity in large populations of plant species brit density was associated with genotypic composition of populations. That is populations with small densities had different genotypes than those with large densities To sample a maximal amount of regional genotypic variation we recommend choosing plant populations representing a range of densities. Findings from our study should be generally applicable to Plant populations that have occupied habitats long enough for natural selection to affect focal genotypic composition. Used in conjunction with other established criteria population density may be a useful rule of thumb for conservation practitioners concerned with the maintenance of adaptive genetic variation in plant species. 389:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,3:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,40:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, All species ranges are the result of successful past invasions. Thus models of species invasions and their failure can provide insight into the formation of a species geographic range. Here we study the properties of invasion models when a species cannot persist below a critical population density known as an   Allee threshold.   In both spatially continuous reaction diffusion models and spatially discrete coupled ordinary differential equation models the Allee effect can cause an invasion to fail. In patchy landscapes (with dynamics described by the spatially discrete model) range limits caused by propagation failure (pinning) are stable over a wide range of parameters whereas in an uninterrupted habitat (with dynamics described by a spatially continuous model) the zero velocity solution is structurally unstable and thus unlikely to persist in nature. We derive conditions under which invasion waves are pinned in the discrete space model and discuss their implications for spatially complex dynamics including critical phenomena in ecological landscapes. Our results suggest caution when interpreting abrupt range limits as stemming either from competition between species or a hard environmental limit that cannot be crossed: under a wide range of plausible ecological conditions species ranges may be limited by an Allee effect. Several example systems appear to fit our general model. 411:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recovery of endangered species in highly fragmented habitats often requires habitat restoration. Selection of restoration sites typically involves too many options and too much uncertainty to reach a decision based on. existing reserve design. methods. The Fenders blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi) survives in small isolated patches of remnant prairie in Oregons Willamette Valley a habitat for which  0.5 PeRcEnT of the original remains. Recovery of this species will require considerable habitat restoration. We investigated the potential of biologically based rules of thumb and more complex models to serve as tools in making land acquisitions. Based on Fenders blue dispersal behavior and demography we have estimated that restored patches should be  1 km from existing habitat and at least 2 ha. We compared these rules to the results of two modeling approaches: an incidence function model and a spatially explicit simulation of demography and dispersal behavior: Not surprisingly the simple rules and complex models all conclude that large ( 2 ha) connected ( 1 kin) patches have the highest restoration value. The dispersal model however suggests that small connected patches have more restoration value than large isolated patches whereas the incidence function model suggests that size and connectivity are equally important. These differences stem from model assumptions. We used incidence functions to predict long term stochastic steady state conditions and dispersal simulations to predict short term (25 year) colonization dynamics. To apply our results in the context of selecting restoration sites on the ground we recommend selecting nearby sites when short term colonization dynamics are expected to be an important aspect of a species biology. 415:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,431:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,431:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Authors examining pollinator declines frequently discuss pollination deficits either as contemporary evidence that declines have occurred or as a possible negative consequence of future declines. Because pollination deficits can be measured in short term studies it would be useful if such studies could somehow replace painstaking documentation of insect population trends. I examine the legitimacy of this type of substitution with reference to evolutionary theory and natural plant populations. Operationally pollination deficits are detected through pollen supplementation experiments. Although simple these experiments are subject to subtleties of interpretation because of biases and nonlinear responses which I discuss. Although it has been found that in 62 PeRcEnT of the natural populations studied fruit or seed sets are at least sometimes limited by insufficient pollen other research suggests that intact natural systems ought to arrive at an evolutionary equilibrium in which reproduction is limited equally by pollination and by maternal resources. Therefore chronic severe pollination deficits may indicate that the pollinator service of a plant population has declined from some higher level in the past. However there is no evidence of widespread declines and because of stochastic factors in nature occasional shortfalls of pollination should be expected even at equilibrium. Although the effects of pollination deficits on plant population dynamics have been little studied moderate declines in seed production may have relatively little effect on population growth rates because resources not expended on fruits and seeds may be reallocated to vegetative persistence or spread. It is therefore premature to conclude that pollinator declines are having strong effects on natural plant populations but this mostly reflects a lack of data and is no cause for complacency. Theory must be supplemented by case studies; I give one example and recommendations. 432:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Changes in flower visiting insect populations or communities that result from human impacts can be documented by measuring spatial or temporal trends or by comparing abundance or species composition before and after disturbance. The level of naturally occurring variation in populations and communities over space and time will dictate the sampling effort required to detect human induced changes. We compiled a set of existing surveys of the bee faunas of natural communities from around the world to examine patterns of abundance and richness. We focused on a subset of these studies to illustrate variation in bee communities among different sites and within sites over different spatial and temporal scales. We used examples from our compilation and other published studies to illustrate sampling approaches that maximize the value of future sampling efforts. Existing studies suggest that bee faunas are locally diverse highly variable in space and time and often rich in rare species. All of these attributes indicate that intense sampling among sites and years will be required to differentiate changes due to specific impacts from the natural dynamics of populations and communities. Given the limits on time and funding for studying bees approaches that maximize information for effort must be sought for future studies. Reliable information on population and community changes may be gleaned from examining   functional groups   rather than entire faunas. Regardless of the purpose of the study standardized sampling protocols using replicated designs will increase the value of data. Standardization permits statistical testing of changes in bee populations and communities and allows for rigorous comparison between studies. 434:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem health and agricultural wealth in North America depend on a particular invertebrate fauna to deliver pollination services. Extensive losses in pollinator guilds and communities can disrupt ecosystem integrity a circumstance that today forces most farmers to rely on honey bees for much fruit and seed production. Are North Americas invertebrate pollinator faunas already widely diminished or currently threatened by human activities? How would we know what are the spatiotemporal scales for detection and which anthropogenic factors are responsible? Answers to these questions were considered by participants in a workshop sponsored by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in October of 1999 and these questions form the nucleus for the papers in this special issue. Several contributors critically interpret the evidence for declines of bee and fly pollinators the pollination deficits that should ensue and their economic costs. Spatiotemporal unruliness in pollinator numbers particularly bees is shown to hinder our current insights highlighting the need for refined survey and sampling designs. At the same time two remarkable studies clearly show the long term persistence of members of complex bee communities. Other authors offer new perspectives on habitat fragmentation and global warming as drivers of pollinator declines. Bees and lepidopterans are contrasted in terms of their natural genetic variation and their consequent resilience in the face of population declines. Overall many ecologists and conservation biologists have not fully appreciated the daunting challenges that accompany sampling designs taxonomy and the natural history of bees flies and other invertebrate pollinators a circumstance that must be remedied if we are to reliably monitor invertebrate pollinator populations and respond to their declines with effective conservation measures. 435:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Few studies directly address the consequences of habitat fragmentation for communities of pollinating insects particularly for the key pollinator group bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes). Bees typically live in habitats where nesting substrates and bloom are patchily distributed and spatially dissociated. Bee studies have all defined habitat fragments as remnant patches of floral hosts or forests overlooking the nesting needs of bees. Several authors conclude that habitat fragmentation is broadly deleterious but their own data show that some native species proliferate in sampled fragments. Other studies report greater densities and comparable diversities of native bees at flowers in some fragment size classes relative to undisrupted habitats but find dramatic shifts in species composition. Insightful studies of habitat fragmentation and bees will consider fragmentation alteration and loss of nesting habitats not just patches of forage plants as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix to interpatch movement. Inasmuch as the floral associations and nesting habits of bees are often attributes of species or subgenera ecological interpretations hinge on authoritative identifications. Study designs must accommodate statistical problems associated with bee community samples especially non normal data and frequent zero values. The spatial scale of fragmentation must be appreciated: bees of medium body size can regularly fly 1 2 km from nest site to forage patch. Overall evidence for prolonged persistence of substantial diversity and abundances of native bee communities in habitat fragments of modest size promises practical solutions for maintaining bee populations. Provided that reserve selection design and management can address the foraging and nesting needs of bees networks of even small reserves may hold hope for sustaining considerable pollinator diversity and the ecological services pollinators provide. 437:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent attention to pollinator declines has focused largely on bees and vertebrates. However few pollination systems are obligate and pollinators that complement the role of bees may respond differently to environmental disturbance. The conservation status of North American fly pollinators remains undocumented. In this paper methods for monitoring shifts in dipteran pollinator abundance are discussed. The need for further basic research into pollination by flies is addressed and the significance of dipteran conservation is considered. 441:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We reviewed the theory of conservation genetics with special emphasis on the influence of haplodiploidy and other aspects of bee biology upon conservation genetic parameters. We then investigated the possibility that pollinator decline can be addressed in this way using two meta analytical approaches on genetic data from the Hymenoptera and the Lepidoptera. First we compared levels of heterozygosity between the orders. As has been found previously the haplodiploid Hymenoptera had markedly lower levels of genetic variation than the Lepidoptera. Bees had even lower levels and bumble bees in particular often seemed almost monomorphic genetically. However the statistically confounding effects of phylogeny render detailed interpretation of such data difficult. Second we investigated patterns of gene flow among populations of these insects. Hymenoptera were far more likely to show genetic affects of population fragmentation than are Lepidoptera even at similar geographic distances between populations. The reduced effective population sizes resulting from haplodiploidy probably contributed to this result. The proportion of species with low levels of gene flow did not vary among the different taxonomic groups within the Hymenoptera. 442:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An important research gap in landscape genetics is the impact of different field sampling designs on the ability to detect the effects of landscape pattern on gene flow. We evaluated how five different sampling regimes (random linear systematic cluster and single study site) affected the probability of correctly identifying the generating landscape process of population structure. Sampling regimes were chosen to represent a suite of designs common in field studies. We used genetic data generated from a spatially explicit individual based program and simulated gene flow in a continuous population across a landscape with gradual spatial changes in resistance to movement. Additionally we evaluated the sampling regimes using realistic and obtainable number of loci (10 and 20) number of alleles per locus (5 and 10) number of individuals sampled (10 300) and generational time after the landscape was introduced (20 and 400). For a simulated continuously distributed species we found that random linear and systematic sampling regimes performed well with high sample sizes (  200) levels of polymorphism (10 alleles per locus) and number of molecular markers (20). The cluster and single study site sampling regimes were not able to correctly identify the generating process under any conditions and thus are not advisable strategies for scenarios similar to our simulations. Our research emphasizes the importance of sampling data at ecologically appropriate spatial and temporal scales and suggests careful consideration for sampling near landscape components that are likely to most influence the genetic structure of the species. In addition simulating sampling designs a priori could help guide filed data collection efforts. 443:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Corridors are a popular tool for conservation of small populations. However two purported benefits of corridors increasing gene flow and providing a means for the recolonization of extinct patches of habitat (population rescue) may have unappreciated impacts on the likelihood that a new allele will become incorporated (fixed) within a population. Using a simulation model I demonstrate that connecting a stable isolated population with a population that requires periodic rescue (due to extinction via natural or anthropogenic disturbance) can affect fixation of alleles in the stable population largely by changing the effective population size Ne of the two patch complex. When disturbance is rare connecting the two patches with corridors can increase fixation of beneficial alleles and increase loss of harmful alleles. However the opposite occurs when rates of disturbance are high: corridors can promote fixation of harmful alleles and reduce fixation of beneficial alleles. Because the impact of corridors hinges upon disturbance frequency  rate of population rescue) population growth rate movement rates and habitat quality different species are likely to have different responses to corridor mediated fixation even if the species reside within the same ecological community. By changing fixation corridors could thus either promote adaptation or extinction. 444:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is generally accepted that most plant populations are locally adapted. Yet understanding how environmental forces give rise to adaptive genetic variation is a challenge in conservation genetics and crucial to the preservation of species under rapidly changing climatic conditions. Environmental variation phylogeographic history and population demographic processes all contribute to spatially structured genetic variation however few current models attempt to separate these confounding effects. To illustrate the benefits of using a spatially explicit model for identifying potentially adaptive loci we compared outlier locus detection methods with a recently developed landscape genetic approach. We analyzed 157 loci from samples of the alpine herb Gentiana nivalis collected across the European Alps. Principle coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) eigenvectors that quantify multi scale spatial variation present in a data set were incorporated into a landscape genetic approach relating AFLP frequencies with 23 environmental variables. Four major findings emerged. 1) Fifteen loci were significantly correlated with at least one predictor variable (R (adj) (2)   0.5). 2) Models including PCNM variables identified eight more potentially adaptive loci than models run without spatial variables. 3) When compared to outlier detection methods the landscape genetic approach detected four of the same loci plus 11 additional loci. 4) Temperature precipitation and solar radiation were the three major environmental factors driving potentially adaptive genetic variation in G. nivalis. Techniques presented in this paper offer an efficient method for identifying potentially adaptive genetic variation and associated environmental forces of selection providing an important step forward for the conservation of non model species under global change. 446:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Population census size (N (C)) and effective population sizes (N (e)) are two crucial parameters that influence population viability wildlife management decisions and conservation planning. Genetic estimators of both N (C) and N (e) are increasingly widely used because molecular markers are increasingly available statistical methods are improving rapidly and genetic estimators complement or improve upon traditional demographic estimators. We review the kinds and applications of estimators of both N (C) and N (e) and the often undervalued and misunderstood ratio of effective to census size (N (e) N (C)). We focus on recently improved and well evaluated methods that are most likely to facilitate conservation. Finally we outline areas of future research to improve N (e) and N (C) estimation in wild populations. 447:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Population differentiation is often quantified using putatively neutral genetic markers. While adaptive  selection driven) genetic markers are becoming increasingly popular they are mostly used for research on evolutionary processes such as local adaptation or speciation. Here we use simulations to evaluate the potential of adaptive genetic data for estimating population differentiation under a range of gene flow population size and selection scenarios. Our results suggest that reduced migration can lead to more pronounced genetic differentiation in adaptive versus neutral genetic differentiation provided that a difference in local selection pressures among spatial locations exists  spatial selection gradients). These results encourage the use of adaptive genetic data for quantifying genetic differentiation even in studies focusing on contemporary or recent processes such as habitat loss and fragmentation. Furthermore our results illustrate that not testing for selection in putatively neutral markers may lead to incorrect inferences about the processes underlying population differentiation. 449:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding how landscape heterogeneity constrains gene flow and the spread of adaptive genetic variation is important for biological conservation given current global change. However the integration of population genetics landscape ecology and spatial statistics remains an interdisciplinary challenge at the levels of concepts and methods. We present a conceptual framework to relate the spatial distribution of genetic variation to the processes of gene flow and adaptation as regulated by spatial heterogeneity of the environment while explicitly considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of landscapes organisms and their genes. When selecting the appropriate analytical methods it is necessary to consider the effects of multiple processes and the nature of population genetic data. Our framework relates key landscape genetics questions to four levels of analysis: (i) node based methods which model the spatial distribution of alleles at sampling locations (nodes) from local site characteristics; these methods are suitable for modeling adaptive genetic variation while accounting for the presence of spatial autocorrelation. (ii) Link based methods which model the probability of gene flow between two patches (link) and relate neutral molecular marker data to landscape heterogeneity; these methods are suitable for modeling neutral genetic variation but are subject to inferential problems which may be alleviated by reducing links based on a network model of the population. (iii) Neighborhood based methods which model the connectivity of a focal patch with all other patches in its local neighborhood; these methods provide a link to metapopulation theory and landscape connectivity modeling and may allow the integration of node and link based information but applications in landscape genetics are still limited. (iv) Boundary based methods which delineate genetically homogeneous populations and infer the location of genetic boundaries; these methods are suitable for testing for barrier effects of landscape features in a hypothesis testing framework. We conclude that the power to detect the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of genetic variation can be increased by explicit consideration of underlying assumptions and choice of an appropriate analytical approach depending on the research question. 450:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding processes and landscape features governing connectivity among individuals and populations is fundamental to many ecological evolutionary and conservation questions. Network analyses based on graph theory are emerging as a prominent approach to quantify patterns of connectivity with more recent applications in landscape genetics aimed at understanding the influence of landscape features on gene flow. Despite the strong conceptual framework of graph theory the effect of incomplete networks resulting from missing nodes  populations) and their genetic connectivity network interactions on landscape genetic inferences remains unknown. We tested the violation of this assumption by subsampling from a known complete network of breeding ponds of the Columbia Spotted Frog (Rana luteiventris) in the Bighorn Crags (Idaho USA). Variation in the proportion of missing nodes strongly influenced node level centrality indices whereas indices describing network level properties were more robust. Overall incomplete networks combined with network algorithm types used to link nodes appears to be critical to the rank order sensitivity of centrality indices and to the Mantel based inferences made regarding the role of landscape features on gene flow. Our findings stress the importance of sampling effort and topological network structure as they both affect the estimation of genetic connectivity. Given that failing to account for uncertainty on network outcomes can lead to quantitatively different conclusions we recommend the routine application of sensitivity analyses to network inputs and assumptions. 459:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,45:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,464:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is evidence that pollinators are declining as a result of local and global environmental degradation 1 4 . Because a sizable proportion of the human diet depends directly or indirectly on animal pollination 5 the issue of how decreases in pollinator stocks could affect global crop production is of paramount importance 6 8 . Using the extensive FAO data set 9 we compared 45 year series (1961 2006) in yield and total production and cultivated area of pollinator dependent and nondependent crops 5 . We investigated temporal trends separately for the developed and developing world because differences in agricultural intensification and socioeconomic and environmental conditions might affect yield and pollinators 10 13 . Since 1961 crop yield (Mt ha) has increased consistently at average annual growth rates of similar to 1.5 PeRcEnT. Temporal trends were similar between pollinator dependent and nondependent crops in both the developed and developing world thus not supporting the view that pollinator shortages are affecting crop yield at the global scale. We further report however that agriculture has become more pollinator dependent because of a disproportionate increase in the area cultivated with pollinator dependent crops. If the trend toward favoring cultivation of pollinator dependent crops continues the need for the service provided by declining pollinators will greatly increase in the near future. 489:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A large number of methods for the analysis of the spatial structure of natural phenomena (for example the clumping or overdispersion of tree stems the positions of veins of ore in a rock formation the arrangement of habitat patches in a landscape and so on) have been developed in a wide range of scientific fields This paper reviews many of the methods and describes the relationships among them both mathematically using the cross product as a unifying principle and conceptually based on the form of a moving window or template used in calculation. The relationships among these methods suggest that while no single method can reveal all the important characteristics of spatial data the results of different analyses are not expected to be completely independent of each other. 528:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Genetic analyses of marine population structure often find only slight geographic differentiation in species with high dispersal potential: Interpreting the significance of this slight genetic signal has been difficult because even mild genetic structure implies very limited demographic exchange between populations . but slight differentiation could also be due to sampling error. Examination of genetic isolation by distance in which close populations are more similar than distant ones has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2 5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25 150 km. Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves whether reserves will be self seeding whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well. 538:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many federal and state management agencies have shifted from commodity based management systems to multiple resource based management systems that emphasize sustainable ecosystem management. Long term sustainability of ecosystem functions and processes is at the core of ecosystem management but a blueprint for assessing sustainability under different management strategies does not exist. Using the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP) as a case study we present one approach to evaluating the landscape scale short term (one and two years posttreatment) consequences of even aged and uneven aged forest management treatments on community level biological diversity. We chose changes in density of ecological species groups representing groups of species with similar resource requirements as our response variable. Changes in density are detectable before species completely disappear from an area and these changes may be an early indicator of significant alterations to community structure and ecosystem function. Meta analysis was used to statistically combine changes in densities across multiple species groups and assess the overall impacts of management treatments on the animal community. We also separately examined changes in density for each ecological species group. Our findings demonstrated that in the short term even aged and uneven aged forest management treatments caused changes in animal community density in Missouri Ozark forests. Even aged management sites showed greater changes than uneven aged management sites after harvesting and changes in species densities were larger two years posttreatment (1998) than one year posttreatment (1997). Evaluation of treatment effects on individual ecological groups revealed that toads forest interior birds and edge early successional birds were significantly affected by management treatments. We did not expect most species groups to exhibit treatment effects because relatively little forest biomass was removed per experimental site (only 10 PeRcEnT) forest cover at the regional landscape level did not change and was generally high during the study and the time scale was relatively short. The challenges facing ecosystem management evaluation parallel the challenges of ecological science in general: identifying appropriate variables spatial and temporal scales and experimental management treatments. The integrative approach demonstrated in this paper is a first step toward the analysis of the effects of management treatments on multiple organisms within an ecosystem. 548:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,548:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Parallel declines of wild pollinators and pollinator dependent plants have raised alarms over the loss of pollination services in agroecosystems. A spatially explicit approach is needed to develop specific recommendations regarding the design of agricultural landscapes to sustain wild pollinator communities and the services they provide. I modeled pollination services in agroecosystems using a pair of models: a stochastic individual based simulation model of wild pollinators pollinator dependent plants and crop pollination; and a set of coupled difference equations designed to capture the nonspatial component of the simulation model. Five spatially explicit models of habitat conversion to crops were simulated and results for pollination services were compared. Mean field behavior of the simulation model was in good agreement with analysis of the difference equations. A major feature of the models was the presence of a cusp leading to loss of stability and extinction of pollinators and pollinator dependent plants beyond a critical amount of habitat loss. The addition of pollen obtained from crop visitation caused a breakdown of the cusp preventing extinction of pollinators but not of wild pollinator dependent plants. Spatially restricted foraging and dispersal also altered model outcomes relative to mean field predictions in some cases causing extinction under parameter settings that would otherwise lead to persistence. Different patterns of habitat conversion to crops resulted in different levels of pollination services. Most interesting was the finding that optimal pollination services occurred when the size of remnant habitat patches was equal to half the mean foraging and dispersal distance of pollinators and the spacing between remnant patches was equal to the mean foraging and dispersal distance. Conservation of wild pollinators and pollinator dependent plants in agroecosystems requires careful attention to thresholds in habitat conversion and spatial pattern and scale of remnant habitats. Maximization of pollination services was generally incompatible with conservation of wild pollinator dependent plants. My prediction is that pollination services will be maximized by providing islands of nesting habitat where interisland distance matches mean foraging distances of wild pollinators. 551:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,636:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,643:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,669:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Animal responses to habitat boundaries will influence the effects of habitat fragmentation on population dynamics. Although this is an intuitive and often observed animal behavior the influences of habitat boundaries have rarely been quantified in the field or considered in theoretical models of large scale processes. We quantified movement behavior of the Fenders blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi) as a function of distance from host plant patches. We measured the butterflys tendency to move toward habitat patches (bias) and their tendency to continue to move in the direction they were already going (correlation). We found that butterflies significantly modify their behavior within 10 22 m from the habitat boundary. We used these data to predict large scale patterns of residence time as a function of patch size using three dispersal models: homogeneous response to habitat heterogeneous response to habitat and heterogeneous response to habitat with edge mediated behavior. We simulated movement for males and females in eight patch sizes (0.1 8 ha) and asked how residence time varies among the models. We found that adding edge mediated behavior significantly increases the residence of Fenders blue butterflies in their natal patch. Only the model with edge mediated behavior for females was consistent with independent mark release recapture (MRR) estimates of residence time other models dramatically underestimated residence times relative to MRR data. 676:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Connectivity among populations and habitats is important for a wide range of ecological processes. Understanding preserving and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable efficient and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines circuit theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance current and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes ( such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories and describe applications in ecology evolution and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning. 683:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Determining whether seed production is pollen limited has been an area of intensive empirical study over the last two decades. Yet current evidence does not allow satisfactory assessment of the causes or consequences of pollen limitation. Here we critically evaluate existing theory and issues concerning pollen limitation. Our main conclusion is that a change in approach is needed to determine whether pollen limitation reflects random fluctuations around a pollen resource equilibrium an adaptation to stochastic pollination environments or a chronic syndrome caused by an environmental perturbation. We formalize and extend D. Haig and M. Westobys conceptual model and illustrate its use in guiding research on the evolutionary consequences of pollen limitation whether plants evolve or have evolved to ameliorate pollen limitation. This synthesis also reveals that we are only beginning to understand when and how pollen limitation at the plant level translates into effects on plant population dynamics. We highlight the need for both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of life history characters Allee effects and environmental perturbations in population declines mediated by pollen limitation. Lastly our synthesis identifies a critical need for research on potential effects of pollen limitation at the community and ecosystem levels. 689:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector based maps delineate land cover types as polygons while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes  habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally  via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields including geography (transportation networks routing applications. siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct. the minimum spanning tree can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl(Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained de spite substantial losses of habitat area so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology. 696:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Field experiments have been designed to account for spatial Structures since the inception of randomized complete block designs by R. A. Fisher. In recent years our understanding of spatial structures led to refinements in the design and analysis of field experiments in the face of spatial patterning. In the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the response variable is it possible to optimize the experimental design to maximize the response to the experimental factors? The questions addressed in this paper are: (1) What is the effect of spatial autocorrelation on type I error of the tests of significance commonly used to analyze the results of field experiments? (2) How effectively can we control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation by the design of the experiment? (3) Which experimental designs lead to tests of significance that have greater power? (4) What is the influence of Spatial autocorrelation on power of ANOVA tests of significance? This paper attempts to answer these questions through numerical simulations with known spatial autocorrelation. Response variable were simulated to represent the SLIM of separate effects: (1) an explanatory environmental variable (which could be used as a covariable in the analysis) with a deterministic structure Plus spatial autocorrelation (2) an effect of the experimental treatments (3) spatial autocorrelation in the response  biological) variable and (4) it random error. The program repeatedly generated and analyzed Surfaces with given parameters (1000 replicates). The rejection rate of the null hypothesis of no effect of the treatment onto the response variable provided estimates of type 1 error and power. The simulations showed the following: (1) In the presence of spatial autocorrelation or if repetitive deterministic Structures are present in the variables influencing the response experimental units should not be positioned at random. (2) ANOVA that takes blocking into account is an efficient way of correcting for deterministic structures or spatial autocorrelation. (3) For constant effort experimental designs that have more smaller blocks broadly spread across the experimental area lead to tests that have more power in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. (4) Short ranged spatial autocorrelation affects the power of ANOVA tests more than large ranged spatial autocorrelation. 69:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,703:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, I investigated mechanisms of parasitoid coexistence in a spatially structured host multiparasitoid community (harlequin bugs Murgantia histrionica and two specialist parasitoids Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii ) I tested both local and metapopulation hypotheses. The local hypothesis intraguild predation predicts coexistence if the inferior larval competitor is superior at finding unparasitized hosts. Hence the superior larval competitor should be absent from patches of low host productivity. The metapopulation hypothesis dispersal competition trade off predicts coexistence if the inferior competitor is a superior disperser. Hence the superior larval competitor should be absent from patches isolated by distance. Manipulative experiments demonstrate that coexistence does not require a dispersal advantage to the inferior larval competitor. Field surveys show that patches from which the superior larval competitor is absent are not the most isolated but the least productive. In a natural experiment loss of the superior larval competitor was not associated with habitat loss or fragmentation that increases distance among occupied patches but with a large reduction in host productivity. Taken together these results strongly suggest that parasitoid coexistence occurs via local interactions rather than spatial processes This study provides the first empirical evidence of the role of spatiotemporal variation in host productivity on parasitoid coexistence. The results have implications for multiparasitoid food webs in patchy environments and offer practical insights regarding the release of multiple parasitoid species in pest control. 713:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Long distance dispersal (LDD) dispersal beyond the bounds of the local patch or cluster of conspecifics will be most advantageous in landscapes in which large areas of suitable habitat are consistently available at long distances from established populations. We review conditions under which LDD will be selected and conclude that biotic interactions and in particular specialized natural enemies are likely to be one of the most important factors selecting for LDD in many species. We use simple spatially implicit and spatially explicit models to illustrate how such pests affect the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for investment in LDD. Patches currently occupied by parents are more likely to be infected than distant potentially unoccupied . patches thus advantaging dispersal. Patchy infestations also result in higher variance in reproductive success among patches which alone selects for increased among patch dispersal. Both of these effects increase with the strength of the impact of infestation and with the number of species competing for space in the community. We discuss the potential of different types of models and analytical tools to capture the impacts of pests on the evolution of LDD and conclude that even simple models can illustrate the general relationship between pest pressure and LDD advantage but only spatially explicit simulation models can fully elucidate the resulting ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In conclusion we consider the potential role of selection for LDD in the spread of invasive species and in long term responses to habitat fragmentation and range shifts. 718:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Meta analysis provides formal statistical techniques for summarizing the results of independent experiments and is increasingly being used in ecology. The response ratio (the ratio of mean outcome in the experimental group to that in the control group) and closely related measures of proportionate change are often used as measures of effect magnitude in ecology. Using these metrics for meta analysis requires knowledge of their statistical properties but these have not been previously derived. We give the approximate sampling distribution of the log response ratio discuss why it is a particularly useful metric for many applications in ecology and demonstrate how to use it in meta analysis. The meta analysis of response ratio data is illustrated using experimental data on the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on plant biomass responses. 725:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One hundred and seventy six time series of the Japanese wood mouse (Apodemus speciosus) and 185 time series of the grey sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) spanning 31 years (1962 1992) were studied with respect to synchrony and spatial correlation in population dynamics. The time series were collected at fixed sites as part of the rodent census program of the Japanese Forestry Agency. The survey locations cover a region of 115 by 270 km in northern Hokkaido Japan. The average correlation between the time series was 0.34 (C I95 PeRcEnT equals 0.31 0.36 ) for the grey sided vole and 0.16 (CI95 PeRcEnT equals 0.13 0.18 ) for the Japanese wood mouse. This average correlation was decomposed spatially using spatial autocorrelation techniques and the nonparametric covariance function. The lower region wide correlation in the latter species was found to be due to the spatial covariance dropping more rapidly with distance. The spatial scale of the dynamics was measured by the L o correlation length (the distance at which the covariance is equal to that between two randomly chosen sites within the region). This distance was estimated to be similar to 50 km for the grey sided vole and 20 30 km for the Japanese wood mouse. The L o correlation length was linked to the scaling of the underlying ecological processes through a simple epiphenomenological model motivated by diffusion theory (thr exponential covariance model). A review of the ecology of the rodent species indicates that the spatial scale of the pattern of fluctuation of the grey sided vole is more extensive than can be accounted for by a process of dispersal of voles. Predator movement and regulation of the vole by predators are possible causes of the pattern of spatial covariance. The Japanese wood mouse has a scale of dynamics slightly larger than what may be accounted for by the movement of individuals. This species constitutes a negligible part of predators diet. Food resource dynamics may be an important regulatory factor and a source of spatial covariance. We interpret the results as indicating that the natural scales of regulation are species specific and can be large relative to the scale of local populations. 733:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pollination commonly limits seed production as addition of pollen to stigmas often increases fecundity. This response is usually interpreted as evidence that plants stigmas receive too few pollen grains to maximize ovule fertilization ( quantity limitation); however many genetic studies demonstrate that poor quality pollen can also reduce seed production ( quality limitation). We explore both aspects of pollen limitation theoretically with a dose response model that incorporates a saturating negative exponential relation of seed production to pollen receipt. This relation depends on aspects of ovule production pollen import pollen pistil interactions and seed development all of which can contribute to pollen limitation. Our model reveals that quantity limitation is restricted to the lowest range of pollen receipt for which siring success per pollen grain is high whereas quality limitation acts throughout the range of pollen receipt if plants do not import the highest quality pollen. In addition to pollinator availability and efficiency quantity limitation is governed by all post pollination aspects of seed production. In contrast quality limitation depends on the difference in survival of embryos sired by naturally delivered pollen vs. by pollen of maximal quality. We briefly illustrate the distinction between these two components of pollen limitation with results from the mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus. Our model also shows that the standard pollen supplementation technique neither estimates the total intensity of pollen limitation nor distinguishes between its quantity and quality components. As an alternative we propose a methodological protocol that requires both measurement of seed production following excess pollination with only outcross pollen and quanti. cation of the dose response relation of seed output to pollen receipt. This method estimates both the total extent of pollen limitation and its two components. Finally we consider the influences on quantity and quality limitation which reveals that quantity limitation probably occurs much less often than has been inferred from pollen supplementation experiments. These interpretations suggest that an expanded perspective that recognizes the fecundity consequences of pollination with poor quality pollen would promote ecological understanding of pollen limitation. 734:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pollinators may be declining globally a matter of concern because animal pollination is required by most of the worlds plant species including many crop plants. Human land use and the loss of native habitats is thought to be an important driver of decline for wild native pollinators yet the findings of published studies on this topic have never been quantitatively synthesized. Here we use meta analysis to synthesize the literature on how bees the most important group of pollinators are affected by human disturbances such as habitat loss grazing logging and agriculture. We obtained 130 effect sizes from 54 published studies recording bee abundance and or species richness as a function of human disturbance. Both bee abundance and species richness were significantly negatively affected by disturbance. However the magnitude of the effects was not large. Furthermore the only disturbance type showing a significant negative effect habitat loss and fragmentation was statistically significant only in systems where very little natural habitat remains. Therefore it would be premature to draw conclusions about habitat loss having caused global pollinator decline without first assessing the extent to which the existing studies represent the status of global ecosystems. Future pollinator declines seem likely given forecasts of increasing land use change. 73:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many species exhibit widespread spatial synchrony in population fluctuations. This pattern is of great ecological interest and can be a source of concern when the species is rare or endangered. Both dispersal and spatial correlations in the environment have been implicated as possible causes of this pattern but these two factors have rarely been studied in combination. We develop a spatially structured population model simple enough to obtain analytic solutions for the population correlation that incorporates both dispersal and environmental correlation. We ask whether these two synchronizing factors contribute additively to the total spatial population covariance. We find that there is always an interaction between these two factors and that this interaction is small only when one or both of the environmental correlation and the dispersal rate are small. The interaction is opposite in sign to the environmental correlation; so in the normal case of positive environmental correlation across sires the population synchrony will be lower than predicted by simply adding the effects of dispersal and environmental correlation. We also find that population synchrony declines as the strength of population regulation increases. These results indicate that dispersal and environmental correlation need to be considered in combination as explanations for observed patterns of population synchrony. 750:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial synchrony that is correlated population fluctuation over wide geographical areas has been detected in diverse taxa and over various geographical scales. The most commonly suggested mechanisms to explain Spatial synchrony include dispersal and regional stochasticity    the Moran effect  ). We analyzed landscape scale historical outbreak data for six forest insect species: spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) western spruce budworm (C. occidentalis) larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana) forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). We used a recently developed statistical method (the nonparametric covariance function) for quantifying the magnitude and spatial range of synchrony in both outbreak and corresponding weather data. The varying dispersal capabilities of the species enabled us to speculate on the relative importance of dispersal vs. the Moran effect as potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Our results indicated that spatial synchrony was not directly associated with dispersal capabilities at the spatial scales considered. In contrast the spatial correlation in weather variables was high enough to account for the levels of synchrony observed in the outbreak data. Therefore the Moran effect appeared to be the more dominant process affecting the spatial dynamics of these species at the landscape scale. In general however the synchrony in outbreaks declined more steeply with geographical distance than the correlation in the weather variables breaking with the predictions of Morans theorem. A more detailed analysis of gypsy moth outbreak data showed that local dynamics varied considerably in a spatially dependent manner. The existence of such variation violates one of the assumptions of the Morans theorem namely that the dynamic properties of disjunct populations are identical. We used a simple theoretical model to demonstrate that such geographical variation in local population dynamics may indeed force synchrony to decline more rapidly with distance than the correlation in the environment. 800:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Within a plant species environmental heterogeneity has the potential to influence the distribution of genetic variation among populations through several evolutionary processes including natural selection differential gene exchange and chance associations caused by genetic drift or founder effects. We evaluated the relationship between environmental characteristics and the distribution of genotypes for three common woody species (Quercus alba Carya tomentosa and Sassafras albidum) in Missouri Ozark forests. We measured the correlation between multivariate genotypes and forest structure variables and assessed the influence of physical landscape on multivariate genotypes. For all three species we found significant relationships between genetic variation and environmental heterogeneity. We discovered that populations in local habitat patches with different forest structures also differed in combinations of multivariate genotypes. In contrast we did not detect significant differences in multivariate genotypes among soil type aspect classes in any of the three study species suggesting that genotypic differentiation is operating on a finer scale than soil or aspect differences. We conclude that natural selection possibly interacting with founder events has influenced the population differentiation of these three long lived plant species. Such microgeographic variation in response to environmental heterogeneity is expected for a broad range of species even when extensive gene flow is present. 816:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, All species have limited distributions at broad geographical scales. At local scales the distribution of many species is influenced by the interplay of the three factors of habitat availability local extinctions and colonization dynamics. We use the standard Les ins metapopulation model to illustrate how gradients in these three factors can generate species range limits. We suggest that the three routes to range limits have radically different evolutionary implications. Because the Levins model makes simplifying assumptions about the spatial coupling of local populations ave present numerical studies of spatially explicit metapopulation models that complement the analytical model. The three routes to range limits give rise to distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Range limits in one species can also arise because of environmental gradients impinging upon other species. We briefly discuss a predator prey example which illustrates indirect routes to range limits in a metacommunity context. 81:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Patch occupancy theory predicts that a trade off between competition and dispersal should lead to regional coexistence of competing species. Empirical investigations however find local coexistence of superior and inferior competitors an outcome that cannot be explained within the patch occupancy framework because of the decoupling of local and spatial dynamics. We develop two patch metapopulation models that explicitly consider the interaction between competition and dispersal. We show that a dispersal competition trade off can lead to local coexistence provided the inferior competitor is superior at colonizing empty patches as well as immigrating among occupied patches. Immigration from patches that the superior competitor cannot colonize rescues the inferior competitor from extinction in patches that both species colonize. Too much immigration however can be detrimental to coexistence. When competitive asymmetry between species is high local coexistence is possible only if the dispersal rate of the inferior competitor occurs below a critical threshold. If competing species have comparable colonization abilities and the environment is otherwise spatially homogeneous a superior ability to immigrate among occupied patches cannot prevent exclusion of the inferior competitor. If however biotic or abiotic factors create spatial heterogeneity in competitive rankings across the landscape local coexistence can occur even in the absence of a dispersal competition trade off. In fact coexistence requires that the dispersal rate of the overall inferior competitor not exceed a critical threshold. Explicit consideration of how dispersal modifies local competitive interactions shifts the focus from the patch occupancy approach with its emphasis on extinction colonization dynamics to the realm of source sink dynamics. The key to coexistence in this framework is spatial variance in fitness. Unlike in the patch occupancy framework high rates of dispersal can undermine coexistence and hence diversity by reducing spatial variance in fitness. 828:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) are a unique form of ecological networks that exhibit a dendritic network topology  stream and cave networks or plant architecture). DENs have a dual spatial representation; as points within the network and as points in geographical space. Consequently some analytical methods used to quantify relationships in other types of ecological networks or in 2 D space may be inadequate for studying the influence of structure and connectivity on ecological processes within DENs. We propose a conceptual taxonomy of network analysis methods that account for DEN characteristics to varying degrees and provide a synthesis of the different approaches within the context of stream ecology. Within this context we summarise the key innovations of a new family of spatial statistical models that describe spatial relationships in DENs. Finally we discuss how different network analyses may be combined to address more complex and novel research questions. While our main focus is streams the taxonomy of network analyses is also relevant anywhere spatial patterns in both network and 2 D space can be used to explore the influence of multi scale processes on biota and their habitat  plant morphology and pest infestation or preferential migration along stream or road corridors). 848:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile agent based ecosystem service (MABES) pollination is affected by land use change and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service providing organisms depend. About one third of crop production depends on animal pollinators while 60 90 PeRcEnT of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site and on biotic interactions occurring locally such as competition among pollinators for resources and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market based forces to influence land use policies which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps determining research priorities and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context. 869:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pollination by bees and other animals increases the size quality or stability of harvests for 70 PeRcEnT of leading global crops. Because native species pollinate many of these crops effectively conserving habitats for wild pollinators within agricultural landscapes can help maintain pollination services. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques we synthesize the results of 23 studies representing 16 crops on five continents to estimate the general relationship between pollination services and distance from natural or semi natural habitats. We find strong exponential declines in both pollinator richness and native visitation rate. Visitation rate declines more steeply dropping to half of its maximum at 0.6 km from natural habitat compared to 1.5 km for richness. Evidence of general decline in fruit and seed set variables that directly affect yields is less clear. Visitation rate drops more steeply in tropical compared with temperate regions and slightly more steeply for social compared with solitary bees. Tropical crops pollinated primarily by social bees may therefore be most susceptible to pollination failure from habitat loss. Quantifying these general relationships can help predict consequences of land use change on pollinator communities and crop productivity and can inform landscape conservation efforts that balance the needs of native species and people. 875:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent improvements in genetic analysis and genotyping methods have resulted in a rapid expansion of the power of molecular markers to address ecological questions. Microsatellites have emerged as the most popular and versatile marker type for ecological applications. The rise of commercial services that can isolate microsatellites for new study species and genotype samples at reasonable prices presents ecologists with the unprecedented ability to employ genetic approaches without heavy investment in specialized equipment. Nevertheless the lack of accessible synthesized information on the practicalities and pitfalls of using genetic tools impedes ecologists ability to make informed decisions on using molecular approaches and creates the risk that some will use microsatellites without understanding the steps needed to evaluate the quality of a genetic data set. The first goal of this synthesis is to provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of microsatellite markers and the risks cost and time requirements of isolating and using microsatellites with the aid of commercial services. The second goal is to encourage the use and consistent reporting of thorough marker screening to ensure high quality data. To that end we present a multistep screening process to evaluate candidate loci for inclusion in a genetic study that is broadly targeted to both novice and experienced geneticists alike. 880:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Simple mathematical models are used to investigate the coexistence of two consumers using a single limiting resource that is distributed over distinct patches and that has unequal growth rates in the different patches. Relatively low movement rates or high demographic rates of an inefficient resource exploiter allow it to coexist at a stable equilibrium with a more efficient species whose ratio of movement to demographic rates is lower. The range of conditions allowing coexistence depends on the between patch heterogeneity in resource growth rates but this range can be quite broad. The between patch movement of the more efficient consumer turns patches with high resource growth rates into sources while low growth rate patches effectively become sinks. A less efficient species can coexist with or even exclude the more efficient species from the global environment if it is better able to bias its spatial distribution towards the source patches. This can be accomplished with density independent dispersal if the less efficient species has a lower ratio of per capita between patch movement rate to demographic rates. Conditions that maximize the range of efficiencies allowing coexistence of two species are: a relatively high level of heterogeneity in resource growth conditions; high dispersal (or low demographic rates) of the superior competitor; and low dispersal (or high demographic rates) of the inferior competitor. Global exclusion of the more efficient competitor requires that the inferior competitor have sufficient movement to also produce a source sink environment. 886:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sustainable agricultural landscapes by definition provide high magnitude and stability of ecosystem services biodiversity and crop productivity. However few studies have considered landscape effects on the stability of ecosystem services. We tested whether isolation from florally diverse natural and semi natural areas reduces the spatial and temporal stability of flower visitor richness and pollination services in crop fields. We synthesised data from 29 studies with contrasting biomes crop species and pollinator communities. Stability of flower visitor richness visitation rate (all insects except honey bees) and fruit set all decreased with distance from natural areas. At 1 km from adjacent natural areas spatial stability decreased by 25 16 and 9 PeRcEnT for richness visitation and fruit set respectively while temporal stability decreased by 39 PeRcEnT for richness and 13 PeRcEnT for visitation. Mean richness visitation and fruit set also decreased with isolation by 34 27 and 16 PeRcEnT at 1 km respectively. In contrast honey bee visitation did not change with isolation and represented   25 PeRcEnT of crop visits in 21 studies. Therefore wild pollinators are relevant for crop productivity and stability even when honey bees are abundant. Policies to preserve and restore natural areas in agricultural landscapes should enhance levels and reliability of pollination services. 896:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Janzen Connell hypothesis states that local species specific density dependence mediated through specialist enemies of offspring such as fungal pathogens and insect seed predators can facilitate coexistence of species by preventing recruitment near conspecific adults. We use spatially explicit simulation models and analytical approximations to evaluate how spatial scales of offspring and enemy dispersal affect species richness. In comparison with model communities in which both offspring and enemies disperse long distances species richness is substantially decreased when offspring disperse long distances and enemies disperse short distances. In contrast when both offspring and enemies disperse short distances species richness more than doubles and adults of each species are highly spatially clumped. For the range of conditions typical of tropical forests locally dispersing specialist enemies may decrease species richness relative to enemies that disperse long distances. In communities where dispersal distances of both offspring and enemies are short local effects may enhance species richness. 909:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This contribution proposes the meta ecosystem concept as a natural extension of the metapopulation and metacommunity concepts. A meta ecosystem is defined as a set of ecosystems connected by spatial flows of energy materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries. This concept provides a powerful theoretical tool to understand the emergent properties that arise from spatial coupling of local ecosystems such as global source sink constraints diversity productivity patterns stabilization of ecosystem processes and indirect interactions at landscape or regional scales. The meta ecosystem perspective thereby has the potential to integrate the perspectives of community and landscape ecology to provide novel fundamental insights into the dynamics and functioning of ecosystems from local to global scales and to increase our ability to predict the consequences of land use changes on biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to human societies. 946:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Landscapes are strongly shaped by the degree of interaction between pattern and process. This paper examines how ecological memory the degree to which an ecological process is shaped by its past modifications of a landscape influences landscape dynamics. I use a simulation model to examine how ecological memory shapes the landscape dynamics produced by the interaction of vegetative regrowth and fire. The model illustrated that increased ecological memory increased the strength and spatial extent of landscape pattern. The extent of these changes depended upon the relative rates of vegetative recovery and fire initiation. When ecological memory is strong landscape pattern is persistent; pattern tends to be maintained rather than destroyed by fire. The generality of the simulation model suggests that these results may also apply to disturbance processes other than fire. The existence of ecological memory in ecosystems may allow processes to produce ecological pattern that can entrain other ecosystem variables. The methods presented in this paper to analyze pattern in model ecosystems could be used to detect such pattern in actual ecosystems. 94:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is predicated on structured populations of interacting species where gene flow and the force of selection can vary among populations leading to a mosaic of traits in space. Here I briefly review some recent studies of adaptation by a sterilizing parasite to structured populations of a freshwater snail. The results show geographic structure as expected under the geographic mosaic model. I then consider the effects of virulence and migration on local adaptation by parasites using a computer simulation. The results suggest that high virulence and low migration contribute to the strength of local adaptation by parasites. Highly virulent parasites showed adaptation to local hosts for migration rates of up to 10 PeRcEnT of the population per generation. In addition because of the dynamic nature of host parasite coevolution the magnitude of local adaptation fluctuates over time. During some points in the cycle parasites may be no more effective at infecting individuals from local host populations even though they would be shown to be locally adapted if examined over enough generations. Contrary to expectation parasite local adaptation was not affected by giving the parasite a longer generation time than the host but differences in local selection intensities had a dramatic effect. 984:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite growing interest in the effects of landscape heterogeneity on genetic structuring few tools are available to incorporate data on landscape composition into population genetic studies. Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation by resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation the resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path based distance measures. Moreover the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs including coarse scale range maps simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species range or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change. 985:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Gene flow is a key factor in the spatial genetic structure in spatially distributed species. Evolutionary biologists interested in microevolutionary processes and conservation biologists interested in the impact of landscape change require a method that measures the real time process of gene movement. We present a novel two generation (parent offspring) approach to the study of genetic structure (TwoGener) that allows us to quantify heterogeneity among the male gamete pools sampled by maternal trees scattered across the landscape and to estimate mean pollination distance and effective neighborhood size. First we describe the models elements: genetic distance matrices to estimate intergametic distances molecular analysis of variance to determine whether pollen profiles differ among mothers and optimal sampling considerations. Second we evaluate the models effectiveness by simulating spatially distributed populations. Spatial heterogeneity in male gametes can be estimated by Phi (FT) a male gametic analogue of Wrights F(ST) and an inverse function of mean pollination distance. We illustrate TwoGener in cases where the male gamete can be categorically or ambiguously determined. This approach does not require the high level of genetic resolution needed by parentage analysis but the ambiguous case is vulnerable to bias in the absence of adequate genetic resolution. Finally we apply TwoGener to an empirical study of Quercus alba in Missouri Ozark forests. We find that Phi (FT) equals 0.06 translating into about eight effective pollen donors per female and an effective pollination neighborhood as a circle of radius about 17 m. Effective pollen movement in Q. alba is more restricted than previously realized even though pollen is capable of moving large distances. This case study illustrates that with a modest investment in field survey and laboratory analysis the TwoGener approach permits inferences about landscape level gene movements. 990:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seed production in many plants is pollen limited likely because of unpredictable variation in the pollinator environment. One way for plants to escape the consequences of pollinator variability is to evolve mating systems such as autonomous selling that assure reproduction without relying on pollinators. We explore this hypothesis through the construction and analysis of heuristic models of plant population dynamics in seed or site limited populations. Our analysis suggests several important points: the familiar rule that inbreeding depression greater than 0.5 maintains outcrossing significantly underestimates the threshold required under pollen limited conditions with prior selfing; variability in the pollination environment erodes the ability of inbreeding depression to maintain outcrossing; and variable pollination environments can result in stable intermediate rates of prior selfing. The results reflect the importance of geometric mean fitness (which in a variable environment is less than the arithmetic mean) in the face of temporal variation. 996:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the emphasis on inbreeding avoidance and competition for mates in explaining primate dispersal little is known about how dispersal and mating interconnect in humans. I examine the link between dispersal and marriage using life history data from Oakham MA (1750 1850). 1 find that dispersal status timing and destination were linked to marital status timing and spouses place of origin. Men unmarried individuals and individuals with spouses from Oakham Were less likely to disperse than their counterparts. Individuals with spouses from Owkham also married earlier than others. For women dispersal and marriage often coincided and women were more likely to disperse to their spouses town of origin than were men. Although dispersal coincided with marriage in at least two thirds of dispersal events the majority of cases were inconsistent with. both inbreeding avoidance and mating competition explanations. Where one of these explanations was still plausible dispersal seemed more likely linked to competition for mates than to inbreeding with resource availability also likely shaping dispersal and male control of resources contributing to sex biases in dispersal. 1010:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Models and experiments of the evolution of age and or size at maturation in response to population harvesting have consistently shown that selective harvesting of older and larger individuals can cause earlier maturation. These predictions however are all based on single species considerations and thus crucially neglect the selective forces caused or mediated by species interactions. Here we develop simple models of phenotypic evolution of age at first reproduction in a prey population subject to different types of predation and harvesting. We show that in the presence of natural predation the potential evolutionary response of age at first reproduction to population harvesting is ambiguous: harvesting can cause either earlier or later maturation depending on the type of predator interaction and its strength relative to the fishing pressure. The counterintuitive consequences of harvesting result from the indirect effects that harvesting of a prey population has on the selection pressure exerted by its natural predator since this selection pressure itself typically depends on prey density. If harvest rates are high the direct selection pressures considered in classical analyses prevail and harvesting decreases the age at first reproduction whereas at lower harvest rates the indirect inter specifically mediated effects of harvesting can qualitatively overturn predictions based on simpler single species models. 1077:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With the end of commercial whaling it was thought that populations of the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) would gradually recover. However recent modeling studies have shown that the populations growth rate increased gradually during the 1980s but began declining in the early 1990s when female mortality rates increased substantially. Demographic projections predict that assuming birth and mortality rates remain comparable to those observed in the early 1990s the population will become extinct in less than 200 years. Further extrapolations suggest that reducing mortality rates by a few female deaths per year through conservation efforts would be sufficient to support a slow recovery of the population. However the effects of climate variability and change on calving rates may make the North Atlantic right whale even more vulnerable than previous projections have suggested. Failure to incorporate the effects of climate in demographic projections may lead us to underestimate the conservation efforts required to ensure recovery of this whale population. 1177:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nestling begging has the potential to provide parents with honest information about both short and long term nutritional needs yet the importance of previous feeding experience remains largely untested in empirical studies. We examined the effect of two experimental feeding rates on nestling begging in Southern Grey Shrikes Lanius meridionalis using differences in load size to equalize the total volume of food received. There was variation in the pattern of begging behaviour between six pairs of siblings during a hand feeding trial although individuals maintained a similar begging intensity throughout a 9 h feeding period. Both treatment groups showed elevated begging responses during a terminal deprivation period but nestlings fed small food items at frequent intervals demonstrated higher begging responses after a period of deprivation than did siblings fed large food items infrequently. As nestlings fed frequently with small food items had greater levels of undigested protein present in their faeces than birds fed large items infrequently we suggest experimentally induced variation in digestive efficiency may account for the observed differences in begging behaviour. The possible role of learning the adaptive significance of trade offs between feeding rate and digestive efficiency and a possible conflict of interests between parents and offspring are discussed. 1183:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Time series of 0 and 1 group cod sampled in the period 1919 to 1994 at 38 stations along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast were investigated using spatial and temporal analyses. Both groups displayed similar spatial structure and had similar spatial distributions. Spatial heterogeneity occurred on a mesoscale (differences between fjords) and on a local scale (both groups significantly more abundant at sheltered stations in the inner fjord). Temporal fluctuations exhibiting a cyclic component at around 2 2.5 years were spatially structured on a local scale. The cycle in abundance appears to be a result of biotic interaction such as competition for space and food and or cannibalism between cohorts. Similar long term trends were also observed although those for the 0 group were more pronounced. In contrast to the 2 2.5 years cycle long term trends were related to events taking place on a scale equal to or larger than the Norwegian Skagerrak. The causes of these fluctuations are complex and probably result from factors such as biotic interactions changes in seagrass coverage and fishing. 1185:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a Directed Acyclic Graph visualisation designed to allow interaction with a set of multiple classification trees specifically to find overlaps and differences between groups of trees and individual trees. The work is motivated by the need to find a representation for multiple trees that has the space saving property of a general graph representation and the intuitive parent child direction cues present in individual representation of trees. Using example taxonomic data sets we describe augmentations to the common barycenter DAG layout method that reveal shared sets of child nodes between common parents in a clearer manner. Other interactions such as displaying the multiple ancestor paths of a node when it occurs in several trees and revealing intersecting sibling sets within the context of a single DAG representation are also discussed. 1203:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The study determines the effectiveness of a sexuality positive adolescent sexual offender treatment program and examines subsequent criminal recidivism in the three outcome groups (completed withdrawn referred). The sample consists of 122 adolescent males and their families (491 individuals). Of the demographic variables only living situation was significant such that patients living with parents were more likely to graduate. None of the behavioral variables were found to be significant. Of the treatment variables length of time in the program and participation in the Family Journey Seminar were included in the final model. When they were included in the model no other treatment variable were significantly related to probability of graduation. There were no arrests or convictions for sex related crimes in the population of participants that successfully completed the program. This group was also less likely than the other groups to be arrested(p equals 0. 014) or convicted (p equals 0.004) across all crime categories. 1211:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large herbivores have strongly age structured populations. Because recruitment often decreases as population density increases in unexploited populations the proportion of older adults may increase with density. Because survival senescence is typical of ungulates ignoring density dependent changes in age structure could lead to apparent density dependence in adult survival. To test for density dependence in adult survival we used data from three populations that underwent considerable changes in density. Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis ) on Ram Mountain Alberta ranged from 94 to 232 mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus ) on Caw Ridge Alberta varied from 81 to 147 and estimates of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus ) older than 1 year at Chize France ranged from 157 to 569. We used recent developments of capture mark recapture modelling to assess the response of adult survival to changes in density when age structure was and was not taken into account. Survival rates were 10 15 PeRcEnT higher during the prime age stage than during the senescent stage for all sex species combinations. When adults were pooled into a single age class there was an apparent negative effect of density on female survival in bighorns and roe deer and negative trends for female mountain goats male roe deer and male bighorn sheep. When age class was taken into account there were no significant effects of density on adult survival. Except for male mountain goats the strength of density dependence was lower when age was taken into account. In ungulate populations age structure is an important determinant of adult survival. Most reports of density dependence in adult survival may have been confounded by changes in age structure. 1217:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Theoretical models predict that spatial synchrony should be enhanced in cyclic populations due to nonlinear phase locking. This is supported by Rohani .s (1999) comparison of spatial synchrony of epidemics in two childhood diseases prior to and during the vaccination era. Measles is both more synchronous and more cyclic before vaccination. Whooping cough in contrast is more synchronous during the vaccination era during which multiannual fluctuations are also more conspicuous. 3 Steen . (1990) analysed historic records of cyclic rodents to show that cyclicity was lost during the early part of the 20th century. I reanalyse the data and find that the loss of cyclicity is associated with loss of regional synchrony. I use a coupled map lattice model to show that imperfect phase locking provides an alternative explanation for regionwide synchrony of cyclic populations. 1218:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Through reconciling census totals with population structure annual survival rates were estimated for the juvenile yearling and adult stages of 10 ungulate species over 14 years or longer in South Africas Kruger National Park. During this period four species maintained high abundance levels while six species declined progressively in abundance. Multiple regression models fitted to these estimates indicated that juvenile survival was sensitive to annual variability in rainfall for most of these species especially in the dry season component but with no density feedback apparent. Rainfall components affected adult survival in several of the declining species while negative density dependence in adult survival was evident for three of the four species that maintained high abundance. A negative effect of past prey availability indexing putative changes in predator abundance on adult survival was more strongly supported statistically among the declining species than the lagged effect of prior rainfall potentially affecting herbaceous vegetation cover and composition. The high sensitivity of juvenile survival to environmental variability among these ungulate species was consistent with the general pattern identified for large mammalian herbivores although the absence of any survival response counteracting the density declines was surprising. The susceptibility of adult survival to environmental influences for the declining species appeared unusual and probably reflected an interaction between nutritional shortfalls and a numerical increase in lions preying largely upon the adult segment of these species. The ungulate species that persisted at high abundance seemed resistant to effects of rainfall on food resources and evidently drove the changes in predator abundance. The sharp density effect on adult survival among these species could indicate prey switching by lions following changes in their relative availability. Findings extend past generalizations about the demographic processes underlying the population dynamics of large mammalian herbivores and reveal how the survival rates of particular population segments respond differently to environmental influences. Demographic patterns help reveal the interplay of changing resource supplies predation pressure and population abundance on population changes. 121:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Reproductive skew theory provides a compelling explanation for the partitioning of reproduction among individuals within animal societies. One constructive criticism of the theory is that there are too many models all of which have different assumptions and predictions which makes it difficult to know what to test. Here we begin the process of tackling this problem by re examining the assumptions and predictions of basic concession and restraint models two transactional models that are often tested as alternatives. Concession models assume that the dominant has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may yield some of the groups reproduction to prevent the subordinate from voluntarily departing. Restraint models assume that the subordinate has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may not claim all of the groups reproduction to prevent the dominant from forcibly evicting it. We show that the group dissolution tactics that individuals use ( forcible eviction or voluntary departure) need not be an assumption of the model but rather they can be predicted using Hamiltons rule and the standard variables of skew models. We reveal that the assumption that one individual ( dominant or subordinate) has complete control over the allocation of reproduction is an idea common to both models and we resolve this semantic difference by calling this individual the allocator. We show that regardless of the group dissolution tactics that individuals adopt the allocators share of the reproduction always increases as relatedness increases as group productivity increases and as constraints on leaving to breed elsewhere intensify. We conclude that concession and restraint type models make qualitatively similar predictions and should not be tested as alternatives. In summary this study makes the transactional framework of reproductive skew more general by eliminating restrictive assumptions and more amenable to testing in the field by clarifying assumptions and predictions. 1223:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P 1. Central questions of behavioural and evolutionary ecology are what factors influence the reproductive success of dominant breeders and subordinate nonbreeders within animal societies? A complete understanding of any society requires that these questions be answered for all individuals. The clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula forms simple societies that live in close association with sea anemones Heteractis magnifica. Here we use data from a well studied population of A. percula to determine the major predictors of reproductive success of dominant pairs in this species. We analyse the effect of multiple predictors on four components of reproductive success using a relatively new technique from the field of statistical learning: boosted regression trees (BRTs). BRTs have the potential to model complex relationships in ways that give powerful insight. We show that the reproductive success of dominant pairs is unrelated to the presence number or phenotype of nonbreeders. This is consistent with the observation that nonbreeders do not help or hinder breeders in any way confirming and extending the results of a previous study. Primarily reproductive success is negatively related to male growth and positively related to breeding experience. It is likely that these effects are interrelated because males that grow a lot have little breeding experience. These effects are indicative of a trade off between male growth and parental investment. Secondarily reproductive success is positively related to female growth and size. In this population female size is positively related to group size and anemone size also. These positive correlations among traits likely are caused by variation in site quality and are suggestive of a silver spoon effect. Noteworthily whereas reproductive success is positively related to female size it is unrelated to male size. This observation provides support for the size advantage hypothesis for sex change: both individuals maximize their reproductive success when the larger individual adopts the female tactic. This study provides the most complete picture to date of the factors that predict the reproductive success of dominant pairs of clown anemonefish and illustrates the utility of BRTs for analysis of complex behavioural and evolutionary ecology data. 122:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Several alternative decision rules have been proposed for how individuals assess and choose options such as mates and territories. Three of these rules are the threshold rule where individuals choose the first option that exceeds a preset level of quality the best of n rule where individuals assess a fixed number of options and then choose the best of those options and the comparative Bayes rule where individuals use estimates of options to selectively assess and choose options. It has been previously concluded that the threshold rule produces higher average fitness than the best of n rule when assessment costs are not trivial. However previous comparisons assumed that time and options are infinite individuals can estimate the distribution of option quality without uncertainty or mistakes and individuals receive perfect information about the quality of assessed options. I found that the best of n rule produces higher average fitness than the threshold rule despite significant assessment costs when time for choosing an option is limited when individuals are choosing from a small pool of options when estimates of the distribution of option quality are error prone and when there is uncertainty about the distribution of option quality. I also found that the comparative Bayes rule produces higher average fitness than the threshold and best of n rules when time or options are limited and when individuals receive imperfect information about the quality of assessed options. Therefore the optimality of alternative decision rules depends on more than the size of assessment costs and the previous conclusions of empirical studies that have assumed such need to be re examined. 1235:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Male structural plumage coloration and UV signals in particular can provide information on individual quality and influence female choice while melanin pigmented plumage is largely considered to be important in intrasexual competition. Many avian species demonstrate both types of plumage ornamentation that may convey different information about the signallers quality or condition in addition to age. We examine rufous and blue plumage ornamentation across multiple body regions in relation to age condition and reproductive performance in male western bluebirds Sialia mexicana. We demonstrate a strong positive relationship between head plumage brightness and both male age and the mass of the offspring. Older males are in better condition and display a reduced plumage patch on the back while the size of the rufous breast patch increases with increasing condition but not with age. Spectral characters from the wings and rump were not associated with any of the reproductive parameters measured. In conjunction with published evidence showing that females preferentially accept extrapair copulations from older males these data suggest a need for experimental manipulation of plumage colour in known aged birds to understand mate choice in this species. 1261:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite a large literature documenting the effects of mutualists and or antagonists on plant performance we still have limited insight into the strength of these interactions as this involves quantifying how one species influences the population dynamics of another. Here we use data from two example systems Cynoglossum officinale and Calathea ovandensis to illustrate how experiments demographic data and stage based population models can be combined to estimate interaction strength of insect herbivores on plants. Because many plant populations may not be at equilibrium we conduct transient analyses and contrast these results to more traditional asymptotic results. We calculate three metrics of interaction strength Delta lambda(asymptotic) the change in asymptotic annual per capita plant population growth rate resulting from herbivore exclusion Delta lambda(t) the change in transient lambda caused by herbivores at t equals M (where M equals the time of their maximum effect during the transient phase) and Delta lambda(transient) a time averaged effect of consumers on lambda across the entire transient phase. Fairly strong impacts of insect consumers on plant fecundity do not translate similarly to Delta lambda(asymptotic). Results show that Delta lambda(t) can be larger (or smaller) than Delta lambda(asymptotic) but in our examples Delta lambda(transient) was similar in magnitude to Delta lambda(asymptotic). The transient effects of consumers on lambda were driven by changes in the elasticity of fecundity across the transient phase. These effects were dynamic even though consumer impacts on demography and vital rates were held constant. The importance of particular stages and transitions to annual population growth vary during the transient phase. 6.Synthesis. We describe three metrics of interaction strength Delta lambda(asymptotic) Delta lambda(t) and Delta lambda(transient). These metrics have several advantages over more commonly used trait or performance measures that quantify the outcome of interactions. We illustrate how the transient impacts of consumers on lambda are dynamic with the changing stage distribution of a population and transient elasticities driving these effects. More generally this study shows that the impacts of animals on plant performance do not translate equivalently to plant population growth thereby underscoring the importance of using population models to extend the inference of individual level experiments. 1263:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Matrix population models capture how variation in vital rates among life stages translates to population dynamics. Analyses of these models generally assume that populations have reached a stable stage distribution (SSD) where the proportion of individuals in each stage remains constant. However when life stages respond differentially to environmental cues and perturbations a population may be moved away from equilibrium. Given the multitude of stochastic processes acting in natural systems populations may never be exactly at SSD. It is thus critical to understand how far away populations are from SSD and how distance from SSD influences near term model projections. We analysed published matrix models from 46 plant species spanning a range of life histories that reported both a current stage distribution and projection matrix. We examined the distance between observed and theoretical SSD and the associated consequences for near term transient population dynamics for each species. In the majority of studies populations were near their expected SSD with 80 PeRcEnT falling within one unit of a projection distance (alpha(0)) of zero. This distribution was skewed towards positive values of alpha(0) indicating that the majority of populations had individuals concentrated into stages with high reproductive values. Half of the populations in our survey had projection distances such that transient projections of population size and growth rate were within 10 PeRcEnT of asymptotic projections at 5 years. However in populations where projection distance was   2 deviations from SSD caused important (more than twofold) differences. We also found that larger deviations from SSD were positively correlated with generation time and matrix size. Synthesis. When some life stages within a plant population are more strongly affected by disturbances or stresses than others the results of our literature survey suggest that equilibrium projections will tend to underestimate projections that account for the current stage distribution. Measuring the current stage distribution can help determine whether asymptotic measures of matrix model analyses are reliable and is a crucial step to take when precise population metrics are necessary for guiding conservation and management. 1266:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P  The quantitative relationship between size and reproductive output is a central aspect of a plants strategy: the conversion of growth into fitness. As plant allocation is allometric in the broad sense it changes with size we take an allometric perspective and review existing data on the relationship between individual vegetative (V x axis) and reproductive (R y axis) biomass within plant populations rather than analysing biomass ratios such as reproductive effort (R (R V)). The allometric relationship between R and V among individuals within a population is most informative when cumulative at senescence (total R V relationship) as this represents the potential reproductive output of individuals given their biomass. Earlier measurements may be misleading if plants are at different developmental stages and therefore have not achieved the full reproductive output their size permits. Much of the data that have been considered evidence for plasticity in reproductive allometry are actually evidence for plasticity in the rate of growth and development. Although a positive x intercept implies a minimum size for reproducing a plant can have a threshold size for reproducing without having a positive x intercept. Most of the available data are for annual and monocarpic species whereas allometric data on long lived iteroparous plants are scarce. We find three common total R V patterns: short lived herbaceous plants and clonal plants usually show a simple linear relationship either (i) passing through the origin or (ii) with a positive x intercept whereas larger and longer lived plants often exhibit (iii) classical log log allometric relationships with slope   1. While the determinants of plant size are numerous and interact with one another the potential reproductive output of an individual is primarily determined by its size and allometric programme although this potential is not always achieved. Synthesis. The total R V relationship for a genotype appears to be a relatively fixed boundary condition. Below this boundary a plant can increase its reproductive output by: (i) moving towards the boundary: allocating more of its resources to reproduction or (ii) growing more to increase its potential reproductive output. At the boundary the plant cannot increase its reproductive output without growing more first. Analysing size dependent reproduction is the first step in understanding plant reproductive allocation but more integrative models must include time and environmental cues development. 127:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Risks of population decline are studied extensively in conservation biology but are difficult to estimate because they change abruptly over a relatively narrow range of parameters. We propose that risks of decline may be usefully summarized by the expected minimum population size. This is the smallest population size that is expected to occur within a particular time period. Analytical solutions for the expected minimum population size are obtained for a stochastic population model of exponential growth. In more complex models that are analyzed by Monte Carlo simulation the expected minimum population size may be determined by recording the smallest population size obtained in each iteration and taking the average of these values. Whereas risks of decline change abruptly with changes in parameter values the expected minimum population size changes more gradually. The results demonstrate that the expected minimum population size provides a better indication of the propensity for decline than the risk of extinction (or risk of decline to some other small population size) especially when the risk of extinction is small. 1341:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mast seeding or masting is the variable production of flowers seeds or fruit across years more or less synchronously by individuals within a population. A critical issue is the extent to which temporal variation in seed production over a collection of individuals can be viewed as arising from a combination of individual variation and synchrony among individuals. Studies of masting typically quantify such variation in terms of the coefficient of variation (CV). In this paper we examine mathematically how the population CV relates to the mean individual CV and synchrony concluding that the relationship is a complex one which cannot isolate an overall measure of synchrony and involves additional factors principally the number of plants sampled and the mean productivity per plant. Our development suggests some simple approximate relationships of population CV to individual variability synchrony and the number of individuals. These were found to fit quite well when applied to data from 59 studies which included seed production at the individual level. 1352:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, GAO J QUEENBOROUGH SA and CHAI JP. 2012. Flowering sex ratios and spatial distribution of dioecious trees in a South East Asian seasonal tropical forest. Few studies have investigated multiple dioecious species at the community level. We therefore documented flowering sex ratios and analysed the relative spatial distributions of males and females in a diverse suite of tree species in a little studied tropical forest in Xishuangbanna south western China. Male biased sex ratios were common. Population level male biased sex ratios were found in four of the eight species studied and female biased sex ratios in one. Significant male biased sex ratios were found in at least one size class in all eight species. Male bias was caused by the onset of flowering at smaller sizes in males than females in four species. Male and female individuals had random to aggregated spatial distributions relative to each other. We concluded that similar selection pressures drove the evolution and ecology of dioecious species in many forest ecosystems. 1355:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper presents basic demographic parameters of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) living in and around Amboseli National Park Kenya. The study was conducted from 1972 to the present and results are based on the histories of 1778 individually known elephants. From 1972 to 1978 the Amboseli elephant population declined and then increased steadily from 1979 to the present. Births occurred throughout the year but over 80 PeRcEnT occurred between November and May. Birth rate varied from year to year with a pattern of peaks and troughs at 4 to 5 year intervals. The birth sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1:1. Mean age at first birth was 14.1 years determined from a sample of 546 known age females. Mean birth interval (n equals 732) was 4.5 years for 255 females. Fecundity and calf survival varied by age of the females. Mortality fluctuated from year to year. Sex specific mortality rates were consistently higher for males than females at all ages. 1383:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Two key factors in a populations risk of extinction are major population declines induced by natural or anthropogenic events (catastrophes) and whether the populations rate of growth increases or decreases at very low abundance levels. These two elements should be included in any population viability analysis (PVA) but estimates of the frequency and intensity of catastrophic events and data on the dynamics of low population densities are difficult to obtain. We examined the literature on population dynamics of otariids (fur seals and sea lions) to determine how frequently populations are subjected to major population declines and to what extent depleted populations recover from low population size. We present frequency distributions for percentage declines for otariid life stages (pup juvenile adult female and male) and describe eight examples of events leading to a population decline of 50 PeRcEnT or greater among otariids. We found that numerous otariid populations have been reduced to very low densities by exploitation (low enough to be thought extinct) and have recovered to levels where they are no longer at risk of extinction. This suggests that the reduction in population rate of increase at low densities in otariid populations may not be strong. 1384:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Elucidating the causes of post recruitment mortality is a vital step toward understanding the population dynamics of coral reef fishes. Predation is often considered to be the primary proximate cause of mortality. It has however proven difficult to discern the relative contributions of predation and other processes such as competition for food shelter or mates to patterns of mortality. To determine which other processes might be important drivers of mortality patterns factors related to mortality in the clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula (Lacepede 1802) were examined. Patterns of mortality will not be driven by predation in A. percula because these fish are well protected from predators by their close association with sea anemones. Mortality rates were based on the disappearance of known individuals from a population of 201 in 57 groups during a 1 year field study (in 1997) in Madang Lagoon Papua New Guinea. Mortality rate of A. percula was low (14 PeRcEnT per annum) compared to other coral reef fish probably due to the protection from predators afforded by the anemone. Six factors (reef depth anemone diameter number of individuals density and standard length) showed no association with the probability of mortality (P 0.05). Rank was the only factor associated with the probability of mortality (P 0.03); low rank individuals (ranks 4 6) suffered a higher mortality rate than high rank individuals (ranks 1 3) (P 0.01). The most likely explanation for this pattern was that competition for rank amongst individuals within an anemone resulted in some individuals evicting their subordinates. Individuals probably competed for rank because it conferred access to reproduction and not because it conferred access to food or shelter. Such competition for reproduction will be intense whenever some individuals obtain a greater share of reproduction than others do and it may be an important process influencing the dynamics of coral reef fish populations. 1396:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The availability of habitat at one stage of a species life history may limit the ultimate population size of that species. In particular species that use distinct juvenile habitats may experience bottlenecks at an early life stage that have important and potentially unexpected consequences for adult population sizes. I used intertidal hermit crabs Pagurus samuelis and P. hirsuitisculus as a model system to test experimentally the effect of increasing juvenile and adult habitat (snail shells Littorina sp. and Tegula funebralis) availability on adult population size. Despite strong evidence from these experiments that juvenile hermit crab population size was limited by juvenile habitat availability adult population size was not. Instead results indicated that adult populations were probably limited by recruitment and adult habitat availability. Consequently these results (1) demonstrate that identifying true habitat bottlenecks can be challenging (2) show that identifying true bottlenecks requires one to evaluate the effect of bottlenecks on adult population size and (3) offer a rigorous empirical test of the assumption that hermit crab populations are limited by the availability of large shells. These results also highlight how conservation and management strategies designed to protect species with stage structured life histories must consider the actual role different habitats play in controlling adult population size if they are to be most effective. 1438:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conflicts of interest are part and parcel of living in a social group although these can reduce the fitness of individual members. Here I show that clownfish (Amphiprion percula) adjust their size and growth rate according to their position in the group hierarchy maintaining a welldefined size difference with respect to individuals above them in social rank. This strategy to prevent conflict is a surprising departure from the more usual ploy used by many animals of modifying their behaviour within the group. In Madang Lagoon Papua New Guinea groups of A. percula inhabit sea anemones which protect them from predators. Each group is composed of a breeding pair and between zero and four non breeders5 6.Within each group there is a size based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest (rank 1) the male is second largest (rank 2) and the non breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy is descended (ranks 3 6). If the female of a group dies the male changes sex and becomes the breeding female while the largest nonbreeder becomes the breeding male5. Subordinates benefit from settling in an anemone and queuing for breeding positions their chances of success being determined by their rank within the group8 9. Dominants however gain no benefits from subordinates which are potential challengers for their position (P.B. unpublished results). This asymmetry generates evolutionary conflict over subordinate group membership and dominants occasionally evict or kill subordinates that are of similar size to themselves. Conflict would be avoided however if a size difference could be maintained between individuals adjacent in rank that meant that a subordinate would never present a threat to its immediate dominant. A multivariate analysis reveals that there are well defined size differences between individuals adjacent in rank: the standard length of subordinates (ranks 2 6) is positively related to their rank the standard length of rank 1 and the number of individuals in the group (SAS mixed procedure: rank F4 1374325.71 P 0.0001; standard length rank 1 F1 1374105.37 P 0.0001; number of individuals F4 137414.13 P   0.0001; R240.82) whereas anemone diameter depth and reef had no significant effect. These well defined size differences are maintained by the regulation of growth in response to social context as illustrated by an experiment in which the rank 2 fish is removed from the group (Fig. 2b). In this experiment the growth of rank 3 fish is positively related to the removal of the fish of rank 2 and the growth of the fish of rank 1 and negatively related to its own residual standard length (the difference between observed and expected measures) (SAS mixed procedure: removal F1 484255.82 P 0.0001; growth of rank 1 F1 4846.22 P40.0161; residual standard length F1 48476.12 P 0.0001; R240.89) whereas its initial standard length anemone diameter depth and reef had no significant effect. The removal of the rank 2 fish caused the rank 3 fish to ascend in rank. Subordinates that ascended in rank grew more than individuals that did not ascend in rank. The residual standard length indicates how much smaller (negative residuals) or larger (positive residuals) the subordinates observed standard length was compared with its standard length predicted by its social context. When the initial standard length of a subordinate was less than predicted it grew more than an individual whose initial standard length was greater than predicted. The coefficients of the size analysis indicate that the average difference in standard length between fish of ranks 2 and 3 was 10.1 mm (Fig. 2a). The coefficients of the growth analysis indicate that individuals of rank 3 that were experimentally elevated to rank 2 had the same growth rate as control individuals (rank 3) when their standard length was 10.8 mm greater than that of controls. The similarity of these two estimates shows that the size difference that is found between individuals adjacent in rank would be restored after the disappearance of intermediate individuals. These findings show that there are well defined size differences between individuals adjacent in rank within groups of A. percula and that these are maintained by the precise regulation of subordinate growth. The maintenance of size differences may resolve evolutionary conflict over group membership because subordinates do not become a threat to their dominants. The results indicate that the growth rate and the size adopted by any group living organism could be a strategic response to its social environment. 1441:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Organisms that change sex during their lifetime use a variety of strategies __ they may be female first male first or even repetitive sex changers. Natural selection should favour those individuals that change sex at a time when it increases their reproductive value. Allsop and West claim that the relative timing of sex change is invariant across all animals with individuals changing sex at 72 PeRcEnT of their maximum body size and infer that natural selection for sex change must therefore be fundamentally similar across animals. Here we explain why we believe that Allsop and Wests claims are not supported by their analysis or by their empirical data. Inspection of the data underlying Allsop and Wests results reveals that relative size at sex change (L50 Lmax) is highly variable. The basis for their claim of invariance is a tight relationship and a slope of unity when the average size at sex change (L50) is plotted against maximum size (Lmax). We suggest that the same relationship would hold if the average size at sex change were randomly distributed between Lmat the size at maturity and maximum size. To test this idea we developed a null model. Species were randomly assigned a maximum size (between 2 mm and 1.5 m) a size at maturity (assumed for simplicity to be 50 PeRcEnT of their maximum size)9 and an average size at sex change between maturation and maximum size. We used this null model to generate 10 data sets with 77 species in each. This null model excludes only the factor of interest (the real distribution of size at sex change) while incorporating other realistic factors (such as a non zero size at maturity) that might confound the results. Our regressions of log(L50) against log(Lmax) were indistinguishable from the regression found by Allsop and West. Our analyses gave significant slopes ranging between 0.96 and 1.04 and explained 95 97 PeRcEnT of the variation in size at sex change. Our results satisfy the criteria used to claim that the relative size at sex change is invariant even though the relative size at sex change is randomly distributed. We repeated our analyses with a more realistic null model10 in which each species was randomly assigned a size at maturity of between 40 PeRcEnT and 80 PeRcEnT of its maximum size and found that this did not alter our conclusions. In this model relative size at sex change develops a left skew. Furthermore the variance in L50 Lmax (mean s.d . 0.018 0.003;n 10 data sets) is indistinguishable from the variance found in the real data. The results of the null model of Gardner . depend on the questionable assumption that size at maturity can range over 0 100 PeRcEnT of maximum size.We conclude that Allsop and Wests results do not demonstrate that relative size at sex change is invariant and therefore that they offer no insight into natural selection for sex change. These problems arise because size at maturity and maximum size constrain the set of possible values that average size at sex change may take. When the relationship between Lmax and L50 is plotted on a log log scale these constraints cause apparent invariance in L50 and a restriction in the range of possible slopes to values near 1.0. As constraints on the attribute of interest become more stringent it will generally become harder to reject the null hypothesis that the attribute is randomly distributed between the constraints. Empirical data demonstrate that individuals change sex over a large range of sizes. The timing of and size at sex change are often precisely linked to changes in relative condition and group membership suggesting that natural selection has shaped flexible sex change strategies that are contingent on social context. To advance our understanding further we need to attend to the great variation in sex change strategies within and among species. 1453:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A prominent feature of comparative life histories is the well documented negative correlation between growth rate and life span(1 2). Patterns of resource allocation during growth and reproduction reflect life history differences between species(1 2). This is particularly striking in tropical forests where tree species can differ greatly in their rates of growth and ages of maturity but still attain similar canopy sizes(3 4). Here we provide a theoretical framework for relating life history variables to rates of production dM dt where M is above ground mass and t is time. As metabolic rate limits production as an individual grows dM dt proportional to M 3 4. Incorporating interspecific variation in resource allocation to wood density we derive a universal growth law that quantitatively fits data for a large sample of tropical tree species with diverse life histories. Combined with evolutionary life history theory(1) the growth law also predicts several qualitative features of tree demography and reproduction. This framework also provides a general quantitative answer to why relative growth rate (1 M)(dM df) decreases with increasing plant size (proportional to M 1 4) and how it varies with differing allocation strategies(5 8). 1461:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Body size and temperature are the two most important variables affecting nearly all biological rates and times(1 7). The relationship of size and temperature to development is of particular interest because during ontogeny size changes and temperature often varies(8 12).Here we derive a general model based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics that predicts the time of ontogenetic development as a function of body mass and temperature. The model fits embryonic development times spanning a wide range of egg sizes and incubation temperatures for birds and aquatic ectotherms (fish amphibians aquatic insects and zooplankton). The model also describes nearly 75 PeRcEnT of the variation in post embryonic development among a diverse sample of zooplankton. The remaining variation is partially explained by stoichiometry specifically the whole body carbon to phosphorus ratio. Development in other animals at other life stages is also described by this model. These results suggest a general definition of biological time that is approximately invariant and common to all organisms. 1476:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Population biologists have long been interested in the variability of natural populations(1 6). One approach to dealing with ecological complexity is to reduce the system to one or a few species for which meaningful equations can be solved Here we explore an alternative approach(7 8) by studying the statistical properties of a data set containing over 600 species namely the North American breeding bird survey(9). The survey has recorded annual species abundances over a 31 year period along more than 3 000 observation routes(10). We now analyse the dynamics of population variability using this data set and find scaling features in common with inanimate systems composed of strongly interacting subunits(11). Specifically we find that the distribution of changes in population abundance over a one year interval is remarkably symmetrical with long tails extending over six orders of magnitude. The variance of the population over a time series increases as a power law with increasing time lag indicating long range correlation in population size fluctuations(12). We also find that the distribution of species lifetimes (the time between colonization and local extinction) within local patches is a power law with an exponential cutoff imposed by the finite length of the time series. Our results provide a quantitative basis for modelling the dynamics of large species assemblages. 1478:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Several equations have been proposed to describe ontogenetic growth trajectories for organisms justified primarily on the goodness of rt rather than on any biological mechanism. Here we derive a general quantitative model based on fundamental principles for the allocation of metabolic energy between maintenance of existing tissue and the production of new biomass. We thus predict the parameters governing growth curves from basic cellular properties and derive a single parameterless universal curve that describes the growth of many diverse species. The model provides the basis for deriving allometric relationships for growth rates and the timing of life history events. 151:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1520:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Once again I want to emphasize that despite agreement on some broad issues arguing about density dependence continues to be a favorite occupation among population ecologists. Some of these controversial issues are technical such as what are the best statistical methods for characterizing nonlinearities for detecting delayed density dependence or for dealing with measurement noise. More fundamental issues include disagreements about how to define regulation and how prevalent regulation is in nature. (note that the question of what are relative contributions of endogenous versus exogenous factors to population change is a separate issue from what factors contribute to population regulation. Perhaps the key issue in this disagreement is how to relate statistically detected patterns in time series data to possible ecological mechanisms responsible for population fluctuations. For example den Boer and Reddingius while admitting that   perhaps statistically significant densith dependence occurs more often in insect populations than we thought beforehand   nevertheless argue that   this statistical testing . did not contribute very much to our understanding of regulation and stabilization in animal populations. We were not sure population regulation very often occurs in nautre and we still are not  . A more technical criticism was advanced by Williams and Liebhold who argued that a statistical pattern suggestive of second order feedbacks (delayed density dependence) may arise spuriously as a result of serial correlations in some exogenous variable. A very important general issue that remains to be resolved is how much we can infer about population processes by combining mathematical models with time series analysis. Finally I have not even touched on the spatial aspects of population regulation (and do not intend to do so as it would require a whole other article if not a book). Even more fundamentally some critics continue to question the basic tenets of the current research program into population regulation. I believe that such criticisms should not be left unanswered. However instead of the usual strategy in debates on population regulation pointing out where the opponent is wrong I follow a somewhat different tack. Essentially my artument will be that an alternative philosophical stance than the one championed by Murray leads to a more fruitful research program. 1673:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding population extinctions is a chief goal of ecological theory. While stochastic theories of population growth are commonly used to forecast extinction models used for prediction have not been adequately tested with experimental data. In a previously published experiment variation in available food was experimentally manipulated in 281 laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test hypothesized effects of environmental variation on population persistence. Here half of those data were used to select and fit a stochastic model of population growth to predict extinctions of populations in the other half. When density dependent demographic stochasticity was detected and incorporated in simple stochastic models rates of population extinction were accurately predicted or only slightly biased. However when density dependent demographic stochasticity was not accounted for as is usual when forecasting extinction of threatened and endangered species predicted extinction rates were severely biased. Thus an experimental demonstration shows that reliable estimates of extinction risk may be obtained for populations in variable environments if high quality data are available for model selection and if density dependent demographic stochasticity is accounted for. These results suggest that further consideration of density dependent demographic stochasticity is required if predicted extinction rates are to be relied upon for conservation planning. 168:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Explanations for the existence of alternative male mating tactics focus primarily on male male competition. Mating systems however are composed of interactions both within and between the sexes and the role of female behavior in shaping male mating tactics should not be overlooked. By using a dynamic state variable game model I examine how female mate assessment and choice behavior affect the frequency of alternative male mating tactics. When females can accurately assess the quality of males only males with high quality are likely to be chosen as mates and thus lower quality males gain little fitness from courting females. This leads lower quality males to switch to an alternative mating tactic that attempts to circumvent female mate choice. In contrast if the abilities of females to accurately assess males are constrained by assessment costs imperfect information or time constraints or if the pool of available males is smaller then lower quality males are increasingly chosen as mates and they less often use alternative mating tactics. Thus female behavior shapes the frequency of alternative male mating tactics. A consequence of this game between the sexes is that male behavior  increased alternative mating tactics) decreases the benefits females might otherwise gain from lower assessment costs clearer signals of male quality more time to choose a male and more males from which to choose a mate. 1694:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Demographic parameters such as birth and death rates determine the persistence of populations. Understanding the mechanisms that influence these rates is essential to developing effective management strategies. Alloparental behavior or the care of non filial young has been documented in many species and has been shown to influence offspring survival. However the role of alloparental behavior in maintaining population viability has not been previously studied. Here we provide the first evidence for adoption in California sea lions and show that adoption potentially works to maintain a high survival rate of young and may ultimately contribute to population persistence. Alloparental behavior should have a positive effect on the population growth rate when the sum of the effects on fitness for the alloparent and beneficiary is positive. 1697:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In polygynous mating systems males often increase their fecundity via aggressive defense of mates and or resources necessary for successful mating. Here we show that both male and female reproductive behavior during the breeding season (June August) affect female fecundity a vital rate that is an important determinant of population growth rate and viability. By using 4 years of data on behavior and demography of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) we found that male behavior and spatial dynamics aggression and territory size are significantly related to female fecundity. Higher rates of male aggression and larger territory sizes were associated with lower estimates of female fecundity within the same year. Female aggression was significantly and positively related to fecundity both within the same year as the behavior was measured and in the following year. These results indicate that while male aggression and defense of territories may increase male fecundity such interactions may cause a reduction in the overall population growth rate by lowering female fecundity. Females may attempt to offset male related reductions in female fecundity by increasing their own aggression perhaps to defend pups from incidental injury or mortality. Thus in polygynous mating systems male aggression may increase male fitness at the cost of female fitness and overall population viability. 169:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, How big an animal group will be depends on how the groups size is regulated and on the costs and benefits of living in the group. To determine which individuals regulate group size of the clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula I investigated the strategies involved in the formation maintenance and dissolution of its groups. Groups composed of a single breeding pair and of zero to four nonbreeding subordinates occupied individual sea anemones (Heteractis magnifica) which provided the fish with oviposition sites and protection from predators. Group size increased linearly with anemone size. I used the residuals of this relationship as a measure of the degree of saturation of each anemone. Residents evicted low rank subordinates and prevented the recruitment of additional subordinates at anemones with a high degree of saturation but not at anemones with a low degree of saturation. These strategies indicate that residents control group membership of their subordinates and suggest that residents might incur costs from the presence of subordinates in more saturated anemones. In general whenever residents can control group membership the prevention of recruitment and the eviction of subordinates will set an upper limit on group size. 1713:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Foliage feeding forest insects have served as model systems in the study of animal populations for more than 50 years. Early studies emphasized identification of   key   mortality agents or density dependent sources of mortality. However these efforts became burdened by rhetorical ambiguity and population ecologists are increasingly focusing on characterizing population behavior and identifying the processes that generate that behavior. Two types of behavior seem to be common in forest insect populations: periodic oscillations (  population cycles  ) and spatial synchrony (synchronous fluctuations over large geographic areas). Several population processes  host pathogen interactions) have been demonstrated to be capable of producing periodic oscillations but the precise identity of these processes remains uncertain for most forest insects and presents a challenge to future research. As part of these efforts a greater emphasis is needed on the use of statistical methods for detecting periodic behavior and for identifying other types of population behavior  equilibrium dynamics limit cycles transient dynamics). Spatial synchrony appears to be even more ubiquitous in forest insect populations. Dispersal and regional stochasticity (  Moran effect  ) have been shown to be capable of producing synchrony but again more research is needed to determine the relative contribution of these processes to synchrony observed in natural populations. In addition there is a need to search for other types of time space patterns  traveling waves spiral waves) in forest insect populations and to determine their causes. 1715:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Variation in the abundance of animals has traditionally been explained as the outcome of endogenous forcing from density dependence and exogenous forcing arising from variation in weather and predation. Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of density dependence interact with external influences on population dynamics. In particular spatial heterogeneity in resources and the presence of capable predators may weaken feedbacks from density dependence to growth of populations. We used the Kalman filter to analyze 23 time series of estimates of abundance of northern ungulate populations arrayed along a latitudinal gradient (latitude range of 40A degrees 70A degrees N) to evaluate the influence of spatial heterogeneity in resources and predation on density dependence. We also used contingency tables to test whether density dependence was independent of the presence of carnivores (our estimate of predation) and multiple regressions to determine the effects of spatial heterogeneity in resources predation and latitude on the strength of density dependence. Our results showed that the strength of density dependence of ungulate populations was low in the presence of large carnivores particularly at northern latitudes with low primary productivity. We found that heterogeneity in elevation which we assume acted as a surrogate for spatial heterogeneity in plant phenology also reduced effects of density dependence. Thus we show that external forces created by heterogeneity in resources and predation interact with internal feedbacks from population density to shape dynamics of populations of northern ungulates. 171:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The formation of animal societies is a major transition in evolution. It is challenging to understand why societies are stable given the reproductive conflicts inherent within them. Reproductive skew theory provides a compelling explanation for how and why reproductive conflicts are resolved. Indeed some have suggested that skew theory represents a general theory of social evolution. Lamentably skew theory is composed of many independent models with the generality of each model being restricted by its assumptions. Here we tackle this problem using Hamiltons rule to predict the conditions under which assumptions of major classes of skew models (transactional and tug of war) apply. First building on transactional models we define the amount of reproduction that individuals can negotiate based on the threat of group dissolution (the   outside option  ) and determine conditions under which groups will be stable (free of group dissolution). Second building on tug of war models we define the amount of reproduction that individuals can negotiate based on the threat of costly competition (the   inside option  ) and determine conditions under which groups will be tranquil (free of costly competition). Finally synthesizing transactional and tug of war approaches we determine the conditions under which individuals will negotiate based on outside rather than inside options. Simply individuals will negotiate using their outside option when it is greater than their inside option and vice versa. We conduct a post hoc test of all predictions in one simple animal society the clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula. The product is a more general and demonstrably testable model of reproductive skew which should help to refocus the debate surrounding the utility of reproductive skew theory as a general theory of social evolution. 1727:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Complex ecological and economic systems show fluctuations in macroscopic quantities such as exchange rates size of companies or populations that follow non Gaussian tent shaped probability distributions of growth rates with power law decay which suggests that fluctuations in complex systems may be governed by universal mechanisms independent of particular details and idiosyncrasies. We propose here that metabolic rate within individual organisms may be considered as an example of an emergent property of a complex system and test the hypothesis that the probability distribution of fluctuations in the metabolic rate of individuals has a   universal   form regardless of body size or taxonomic affiliation. We examined data from 71 individuals belonging to 25 vertebrate species (birds mammals and lizards). We report three main results. First for all these individuals and species the distribution of metabolic rate fluctuations follows a tent shaped distribution with power law decay. Second the standard deviation of metabolic rate fluctuations decays as a power law function of both average metabolic rate and body mass with exponents 0.352 and 1 4 respectively. Finally we find that the distributions of metabolic rate fluctuations for different organisms can all be rescaled to a single parent distribution supporting the existence of general principles underlying the structure and functioning of individual organisms. 172:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,172:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The stability of animal societies depends on individuals decisions about whether to tolerate or evict others and about whether to stay or leave. These decisions in turn depend on individuals costs and benefits of living in the group. The clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula lives in groups composed of a breeding pair and zero to four non breeders. To determine why breeders accept the presence of non breeders in this species I investigated the effect of non breeders on multiple components of the breeders fitness. Non breeders did not assist breeders in any obvious way. Experimental removal of non breeders had no significant effect on the survival growth or reproductive success of breeders. Experimental removal of one of the breeding pair showed that non breeders had little effect on the time taken for a widowed breeder to recommence breeding. The results indicate that the presence of non breeders neither enhances nor reduces the fitness of breeders in A. percula. I suggest that non breeders might modulate their effect on the fitness of breeders either by reducing the costs they inflict or by increasing the benefits they provide such that it just pays breeders to tolerate rather than to evict them. This study illustrates that animal societies can be stable even when some individuals gain nothing from the association. 173:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper presents a dynamic state variable model that examines human dispersal in a land based economy. In humans like other animals many individuals disperse during their lifetimes with extensive variability in the timing and likelihood of dispersal by individuals of different slates. The model places human and non human dispersal in a common framework specifically by utilizing a cost benefit approach. As with other animals individual access to resources likely plays an important rule in shaping human dispersal and the model explores the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Over a series of time steps individuals must decide whether to stay in their natal area or disperse given their states (wealth marital and inheritance status) and the environmental constraints on dispersal. Costs of dispersal include time and an initial drop in wealth while the benefit is the potential of the dispersal area to increase wealth. The model determines whether dispersing or staying results in the highest fitness where fitness is a function of individual wealth and years married. The model shows that dispersal is favorable under a wide range of environmental conditions but: that it also varies predictably according to individual states. Men of middle wealth values disperse under a wider variety of circumstances than poorer or wealthier men. Wealthy men who are particularly sensitive to the time cost and mortality risk associated with dispersing appear to adopt a more conservative dispersal strategy than poorer men who are more sensitive to the wealth cost and wealth growth rate associated with dispersing. Dispersal behavior is also contingent on its effects on an individuals probability of marrying or inheriting wealth. Finally the model fosters an examination of how the interaction of life events and their directions of causation can be studied. 174:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, When eggs hatch asynchronously offspring arising from last hatched eggs often exhibit a competitive disadvantage compared with their older larger nestmates. Strong sibling competition might result in a pattern of resource allocation favoring larger nestlings but active food allocation towards smaller offspring may compensate for the negative effects of asynchronous hatching. We examined patterns of resource allocation by green rumped parrotlet parents to small and large broods under control and food supplemented conditions. There was no difference between parents and among brood sizes in visit rate or number of feeds delivered although females spent marginally more time in the nest than males. Both male and female parents preferentially fed offspring that had a higher begging effort than the remainder of the brood. Mean begging levels did not differ between small and large broods but smaller offspring begged more than their older nestmates in large broods. Male parents fed small offspring less often in both brood sizes. Female parents fed offspring evenly in small broods while in large broods they fed smaller offspring more frequently with the exception of the very last hatched individual. These data suggest male parrotlets exhibit a feeding preference for larger offspring possibly arising from the outcome of sibling competition but that females practice active food allocation particularly in larger brood sizes. These differential patterns of resource allocation between the sexes are consistent with other studies of parrots and may reflect some level of female compensation for the limitations imposed on smaller offspring by hatching asynchrony. 1777:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This study tested two hypotheses concerning the cognitive processes underlying human mate choice in Western society: (i) mate preference is conditional in that the selectivity of individuals mate preference is based on their perception of themselves as long term partners and (ii) the decision rule governing such conditional mate preference is based on translating perception of oneself on a given attribute into a comparable selectivity of preference for the same attribute in a mate. Both hypotheses were supported. A two part questionnaire was completed by 978 heterosexual residents of Ithaca New York aged 18 24; they first rated the importance they placed on 10 attributes in a long term partner and then rated their perception of themselves on those same attributes. Both women and men who rated themselves highly were significantly more selective in their mate preference. When the 10 attributes were grouped into four evolutionarily relevant categories (indicative of wealth and status family commitment physical appearance and sexual fidelity) the greatest amount of variation in the selectivity of mate preference in each category was explained by self perception in the same category of attributes. We conclude that in Western society humans use neither an   opposites attract   nor a   reproductive potentials attract   decision rule in their choice of long term partners but rather a   likes attract   rule based on a preference for partners who are similar to themselves across a number of characteristics. 1788:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Women rarely give birth after similar to 45 y of age and they experience the cessation of reproductive cycles menopause at similar to 50 y of age after a fertility decline lasting almost two decades. Such reproductive senescence in mid lifespan is an evolutionary puzzle of enduring interest because it should be inherently disadvantageous. Furthermore comparative data on reproductive senescence from other primates or indeed other mammals remains relatively rare. Here we carried out a unique detailed comparative study of reproductive senescence in seven species of nonhuman primates in natural populations using long term individual based data and compared them to a population of humans experiencing natural fertility and mortality. In four of seven primate species we found that reproductive senescence occurred before death only in a small minority of individuals. In three primate species we found evidence of reproductive senescence that accelerated throughout adulthood; however its initial rate was much lower than mortality so that relatively few individuals experienced reproductive senescence before death. In contrast the human population showed the predicted and well known pattern in which reproductive senescence occurred before death for many women and its rate accelerated throughout adulthood. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that reproductive senescence in midlife although apparent in natural fertility natural mortality populations of humans is generally absent in other primates living in such populations. 1789:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Year to year fluctuations in fish stocks are usually attributed to variability in recruitment competition predation and changes in catchability Trends in abundance in contrast are usually ascribed to human exploitation and large scale environmental changes. In this study we demonstrate through statistical modeling of survey data (1921 1994) of cod from the Norwegian Skagerrak coast that both short and long term variability may arise from the same set of age structured interactions Asymmetric competition and cannibalism between cohorts generate alternating years of high and low abundance. Intercohort interactions also resonate the recruitment variability so that long term trends are induced. The coupling of age structure and variable recruitment should therefore be considered when explaining both the short and long term fluctuations displayed by the coastal cod populations. Resonant effects may occur in many marine populations that exhibit this combination of traits. 178:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sea otters (Enhydra lutris (L.)) were hunted to extinction off the coast of Washington State early in the 20th century. A new population was established by translocations from Alaska in 1969 and 1970 and currently numbers at least 550 animals. A major threat to the population is the ongoing risk of major oil spills in sea otter habitat. We apply population models to census and demographic data in order to evaluate the status of the population. We fit several density dependent models to test for density dependence and determine plausible values for the carrying capacity (K) by comparing model goodness of fit to an exponential model. Model fits were compared using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A significant negative relationship was found between the population growth rate and population size (r(2) equals 0.27 F equals 5.57 df equals 16 p   0.05) suggesting density dependence in Washington state sea otters. Information Criterion statistics suggest that the Beverton Holt model is the most parsimonious followed closely by the logistic model. Values of K ranged from 612 to 759 with best fit parameter estimates for the Beverton Holt model including 0.26 for r and 612 for K. The latest ( 2001) population index count (555) puts the population at 87 92 PeRcEnT of the estimated carrying capacity above the suggested range for optimum sustainable population (OSP). Analyses of extinction risk associated with oil spills were based on assumptions of variable spill frequency and variable mortality rates associated with spills once they occurred. At lower rates of assumed spill frequency extinction risk was either negligible or was substantial only at the highest assumed mortality rates. At the highest assumed frequency rate (0.5 yr( 1)) extinction risks were high across the full range of assumed mortality rates. Elasticity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of proportional changes in vital rates on the population growth rate (lambda). The elasticity values indicate that the population is most sensitive to changes in survival rates (particularly adult survival). 1790:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Animal societies composed of breeders and non breeders present a challenge to evolutionary theory because it is not immediately apparent how natural selection can preserve the genes that underlie non breeding strategies. The clownfish Amphiprion percula forms groups composed of a breeding pair and 0 4 non breeders. Non breeders gain neither present direct nor present indirect benefits from the association. To determine whether non breeders obtain future direct benefits I investigated the pattern of territory inheritance. I show that non breeders stand to inherit the territory within which they reside. Moreover they form a perfect queue for breeding positions; a queue from which nobody disperses and within which nobody contests. I suggest that queuing might be favoured by selection because it confers a higher probability of attaining breeding status than either dispersing or contesting. This study illustrates that within animal societies individuals may tolerate non breeding positions solely because of their potential to realize benefits in the future. 1796:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Global circulation models predict and numerous observations confirm that anthropogenic climate change has altered high frequency climate variability. However it is not yet well understood how changing patterns of environmental variation will affect wildlife population dynamics and other ecological processes. Theory predicts that a populations long run growth rate is diminished and the chance of population extinction is increased as environmental variation increases. This results from the fact that population growth is a multiplicative process and that long run population growth rate is the geometric mean of growth rates over time which is always less than the arithmetic mean. However when population growth rates for unstructured populations are related nonlinearly to environmental drivers increasing environmental variation can increase a populations long run growth rate. This suggests that patterns of environmental variation associated with different aspects of climate change may affect population dynamics in different ways. Specifically increasing variation in rainfall might result in diminished long run growth rates for many animal species while increasing variation in temperature might result in increased long run growth rates. While the effect of rainfall is theoretically well understood and supported by data the hypothesized effect of temperature is not. Here I analyse two datasets to study the effect of fluctuating temperatures on growth rates of zooplankton. Results are consistent with the prediction that fluctuating temperatures should increase long run growth rates and the frequency of extreme demographic events. 1802:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Individuals are predicted to maximize lifetime reproductive success (LRS) through selective use of resources; however a wide range of ecological and social processes may prevent individuals from always using the highest quality resources available. Resource selection functions (RSFs) estimate the relative amount of time an individual spends using a resource as a function of the proportional availability of that resource. We quantified the association between LRS and coefficients of individual based RSFs describing lifetime resource selection for 267 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) of the Isle of Rum Scotland from 1970 to 2001. LRS was significantly related to first and second order effects of selection for Agrostis Testuca grassland and proximity to the sea coast (quality of forage within Agrostis Testuca grassland was highest nearest the coast (ratio of short: long grassland)). The benefits of selecting for quality in AgrostislTestuca grassland however traded off with increases in LRS gained by avoiding conspecific density. LRS was inversely associated with local density which was highest along the coast and reproductive benefits of selecting Agrostis Festuca grassland diminished with increasing density. We discuss the relevance of these results to our understanding of the spatial distribution of red deer abundance and potential applications of our approach to evolutionary and applied ecology. 1806:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Long term concurrent measurement of population dynamics and associated top down and bottom up processes are rare for unmanipulated terrestrial systems. Here we analyse populations of moose their predators (wolves Canis lupus) their primary winter forage (balsam fir Abies balsamea) and several climatic variables that were monitored for 40 consecutive years in Isle Royale National Park (544 km(2)) Lake Superior USA. We judged the relative importance of top down bottom up and abiotic factors on moose population growth rate by constructing multiple linear regression models and calculating the proportion of interannual variation in moose population growth rate explained by each factor. Our analysis indicates that more variation in population growth rate is explained by bottom up than top down processes and abiotic factors explain more variation than do bottom up processes. Surprisingly winter precipitation did not explain any significant variation in population growth rate. Like that detected for two Norwegian ungulate populations the relationship between population growth rate and the North Atlantic Oscillation was nonlinear. Although this analysis provides significant insight much remains unknown: of the models examined the most parsimonious explain little more than half the variation in moose population growth rate. 180:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1813:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Our knowledge about population level effects of abiotic stressors is limited largely due to lack of appropriate time series data. To analyse interactions between an abiotic stressor and density dependent processes we used experimental time series data for stage structured populations (the blowfly Lucilia sericata) exposed to the toxicant cadmium through 20 generations. Resource limitation results in competition both in the larval and the adult stages. The toxicant has only negative effects at the organism level but nevertheless there were positive population level effects. These are necessarily indirect and indicate overcompensatory density dependent responses. A non parametric model (generalized additive model) was used to investigate the density dependent structures of the demographic rates without making assumptions about the functional forms. The estimated structures were used to develop a parametric model with which we analysed effects of the toxicant on density dependent and density independent components of the stage specific demographic rates. The parameter estimates identified both synergistic and antagonistic density toxicant interactions. It is noteworthy that the synergistic interaction occurred together with a net positive effect of the toxicant. Hence the effects of such interactions should be considered together with the capacity for compensatory responses. The combination of the two modelling approaches provided new insight into mechanisms for compensatory responses to abiotic stressors. 1816:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,Skagerrak populations of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. have been surveyed at several fixed stations since 1919. These coastal populations consist of local stocks with a low age of maturity and a short life span. We investigated 60 time series of 0 group juveniles  young of the year) sampled annually from 1945 to 1994 . An age structured model was developed which incorporates asymmetrical interactions between the juvenile cohorts (0 group and 1 group; one year old juveniles) and stochastic reproduction. The model was expressed in delay coordinates in order to estimate model parameters directly from the time series and thereby test the model predictions. The autocovariance structure of the time series was consistent with the delay coordinates model superimposed upon a long term trend. The model illustrates how both regulatory (density dependent) and disruptive (stochastic) forces are crucial in shaping the dynamics of the coastal cod populations. The age structured life cycle acts to resonance the stochasticity inherent in the recruitment process.1830:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the selective forces that shape reproductive strategies is a central goal of evolutionary ecology. Selection on the timing of reproduction is well studied in semelparous organisms because the cost of reproduction (death) can be easily incorporated into demographic models. Iteroparous organisms also exhibit delayed reproduction and experience reproductive costs although these are not necessarily lethal. How non lethal costs shape iteroparous life histories remains unresolved. We analysed long term demographic data for the iteroparous orchid Orchis purpurea from two habitat types (light and shade). In both the habitats flowering plants had lower growth rates and this cost was greater for smaller plants. We detected an additional growth cost of fruit production in the light habitat. We incorporated these non lethal costs into integral projection models to identify the flowering size that maximizes fitness. In both habitats observed flowering sizes were well predicted by the models. We also estimated optimal parameters for size dependent flowering effort but found a strong mismatch with the observed flower production. Our study highlights the role of context dependent non lethal reproductive costs as selective forces in the evolution of iteroparous life histories and provides a novel and broadly applicable approach to studying the evolutionary demography of iteroparous organisms. 1855:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Population dynamics of the gray sided vole Clethrionomys rufocanus in Hokkaido Japan were described on the basis of 225 time series (being from 12 to 31 years long); 194 of the time series have a length of 23 years or longer. The time series were classified into 11 groups according to geographic proximity and topographic characteristics of the island of Hokkaido. Mean abundance varied among populations from 1.07 to 21.07 individuals per 150 trap nights. The index of variability for population fluctuation (s index) ranged from 0.204 to 0.629. Another index for population variability (amplitude on log 10 scale) ranged from 0.811 to 2.743. Mean abundance and variability of populations were higher in the more northern and eastern regions of the island. Most populations except for the southernmost populations exhibited significant direct density dependence in population growth. Detection rate for delayed density dependence varied among groups from 0 PeRcEnT to 22.6 PeRcEnT. Both direct and delayed density dependence tended to be stronger in the more northern and eastern populations. The proportion of cyclic populations was higher in the northern eastern areas than that in the southern western areas. There was a clear gradient from the asynchronous populations in southwest to the highly synchronized populations in the northeast. 1856:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The biology of the gray sided vole Clethrionomys rufocanus in Hokkaido concerning taxonomy morphology phylogeny distribution and natural history is reviewed. Applied issues in forest management (damage control and census) are also mentioned. Although Clethrionomys rufocanus of Hokkaido was originally identified as a distinct species Evotomys ( now Clethrionomys) bedfordiae Thomas 1905 current literature generally refers to the gray sided vole of Hokkaido as Clethrionomys rufocanus or as C. rufocanus bedfordiae (vernacular name the Bedfords red backed vole). The gray sided vole is the most common small mammal in Hokkaido. It inhabits open areas as well as forests and mainly feeds on green plants. The gray sided vole has a high reproductive potential; litter size: 4 7; gestation period: 18 19 days; maturation age: 30 60 days old. Although spring born individuals usually attain sexual maturity in their summer fall of birth their maturation is sometimes suppressed under high densities. The breeding season is generally from April to October but with some regional variation. Clethrionomys rufocanus has a rather specialized diet (folivorous) particularly during winter when it feeds on bamboo grass. Many predators specialize on the grey sided vole in Hokkaido; even the red fox which is a typical generalist predator selectively feeds on this vole. Damage by voles eating bark used to be sever on forest plantations in Hokkaido. Censuses of small rodents have been carried out for management purpose since 1954. 1858:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We study the regional transitions in dynamics of the gay sided vole Clethrionomys rufocanus within Hokkaido Japan. The data set consists of 225 time series of varying length (most from 23 to 31 years long) collected between 1962 and 1992 by the Forestry Agency of the Japanese Government. To see clearly how the periodic behavior changes geographically we estimate the spectral density functions of the growth rates of all populations using a log spline method. We subsequently apply functional data analysis to the estimated densities. The functional data analysis is in this context analogous to a principal component analysis applied to curves. We plot the results of the analysis on the map of Hokkaido to reveal a clear transition from relatively stable populations in the southwest and west to populations undergoing 3 4 year cycles in the northeast and east. The degree of seasonality in the vegetation and the rodent demography appear to be strongest Ln the cyclic area. We briefly speculate that the destabilization of the rodent dynamics is linked to increased seasonal forcing on the trophic interactions in which the gray sided voles are involved. 1935:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecology is a synthetic discipline benefiting from open access to data from the earth life and social sciences. Technological challenges exist however due to the dispersed and heterogeneous nature of these data. Standardization of methods and development of robust metadata can increase data access but are not sufficient. Reproducibility of analyses is also important and executable workflows are addressing this issue by capturing data provenance. Sociological challenges including inadequate rewards for sharing data must also be resolved. The establishment of well curated federated data repositories will provide a means to preserve data while promoting attribution and acknowledgement of its use. 1943:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human senescence patterns late onset of mortality increase slow mortality acceleration and exceptional longevity are often described as unique in the animal world. Using an individual based data set from longitudinal studies of wild populations of seven primate species we show that contrary to assumptions of human uniqueness human senescence falls within the primate continuum of aging; the tendency for males to have shorter life spans and higher age specific mortality than females throughout much of adulthood is a common feature in many but not all primates; and the aging profiles of primate species do not reflect phylogenetic position. These findings suggest that mortality patterns in primates are shaped by local selective forces rather than phylogenetic history. 1965:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Territorial behavior is expected to buffer populations against short term environmental perturbations but we have found that group living in African lions causes a complex response to long term ecological change. Despite numerous gradual changes in prey availability and vegetative cover regional populations of Serengeti lions remained stable for 10 to 20 year periods and only shifted to new equilibria in sudden leaps. Although gradually improving environmental conditions provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting territories regional lion populations did not expand until short term conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving young. The results of a simulation model show that the observed pattern of   saltatory equilibria   results from the lions grouping behavior. 2005:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many ecological systems experience periodic variability. Theoretical investigation of population and community dynamics in periodic environments has been hampered by the lack of mathematical tools relative to equilibrium systems. Here I describe one such mathematical tool that has been rarely used in the ecological literature but has widespread use: Floquet theory. Floquet theory is the study of the stability of linear periodic systems in continuous time. Floquet exponents multipliers are analogous to the eigenvalues of Jacobian matrices of equilibrium points. In this paper I describe the general theory then give examples to illustrate some of its uses: it defines fitness of structured populations it can be used for invasion criteria in models of competition and it can test the stability of limit cycle solutions. I also provide computer code to calculate Floquet exponents and multipliers. 2015:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examine the effects of density dependence and immigration on local adaptation in a   black hole sink   habitat a habitat in which isolated populations of a species would tend to extinction but where a population is demographically maintained by recurrent one way migration from a separate source habitat in which the species persists. Using a diploid one locus model of a discrete generation sink population maintained by immigration from a fixed source population we show that a locally favored allele will spread when rare in the sink if the absolute fitness (or in some cases the geometric mean absolute fitness) of heterozygotes with the favored allele is above one in the sink habitat. With density dependence the criterion for spread can depend on the rate of immigration because immigration affects local densities and hence absolute fitness. Given the successful establishment of a locally favored allele it will be maintained by a migration selection balance and the resulting polymorphic population will be sustained deterministically with either stable or unstable dynamics. The densities of stable polymorphic populations tend to exceed densities that would be maintained in the absence of the favored allele. With strong density regulation spread of the favored allele may destabilize population dynamics. Our analyses show that polymorphic populations which form subsequent to the establishment of favorable alleles have the capacity to persist deterministically without immigration. Finally we examined the probabilistic rate at which new favored alleles arise and become established in a sink population. Our results suggest that favored alleles are established most readily at intermediate levels of immigration  2033:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation harvesting and pest control are three aspects of the same general problem: population management. All three involve intervention with the aim of regulating population size and growth in some way yet the dissociation of these disciplines is pervasive. Recent developments and a comparison of approaches show the potential of a synthetic paradigm. 2034:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Double blind peer review in which neither author nor reviewer identity are revealed is rarely practised in ecology or evolution journals. However in 2001 double blind review was introduced by the journal Behavioral Ecology. Following this policy change there was a significant increase in female first authored papers a pattern not observed in a very similar journal that provides reviewers with author information. No negative effects could be identified suggesting that double blind review should be considered by other journals. 2043:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Here we review recent empirical advances that have improved our understanding of why and when sex change occurs. We show that sex changing animals use a greater diversity of strategies to increase their reproductive success than was previously recognized: some individuals change sex early others change sex late some individuals change sex more than once and others do not change sex at all. These different strategies can be unified by the principle that individuals change sex when it increases their reproductive value. The breeding tactics (male female or non breeder) adopted by individuals often appear to be adaptive responses to their own social ecological context and variation in these conditions results in significant differences in the timing of sex change within and between species. 2058:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent advances in stochastic demography provide unique insights into the probable effects of increasing environmental variability on population dynamics and these insights can be substantially different compared with those from deterministic models. Stochastic variation in structured population models influences estimates of population growth rate persistence and resilience which ultimately can alter community composition species interactions distributions and harvesting. Here we discuss how understanding these demographic consequences of environmental variation will have applications for anticipating changes in populations resulting from anthropogenic activities that affect the variance in vital rates. We also highlight new tools for anticipating the consequences of the magnitude and temporal patterning of environmental variability. 214:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In the mid 1980s Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) populations were believed to persist in 44 populations on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Twelve of these populations occurred in Lampung Province but our surveys revealed that only three were extant in 2002. Causal factors underlying this decline include human population growth changes in land use and human elephant conflict. Nevertheless our surveys in the Provinces two national parks Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas produced population estimates of 498 (95 PeRcEnT CI equals 373 666 ) and 180 (95 PeRcEnT CI equals 144 225 ) elephants respectively. The estimate for Bukit Barisan Selatan is much larger than previous estimates; the estimate for Way Kambas falls between previous estimates. The third population was much smaller and may not be viable. These are the first estimates for Southeast Asian elephant populations based on rigorous sampling based methods that satisfied the assumptions of the models used and they suggest that elephant numbers in these parks are of international importance. While our results suggest that Sumatras remaining elephant populations may be larger than expected they also suggest that the future for these animals is bleak. Human elephant conflict was reported around all three areas in Lampung and their elephant populations are currently threatened by habitat loss and poaching. Local solutions are possible but will require much greater commitment by all stakeholders. 228:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Invasive predators pose a significant risk to bird populations worldwide. Humans have a long history of removing predators from ecosystems; current island restoration actions typically focus on the removal of invasive predators such as non native rodents from seabird breeding islands. While not overly abundant the results of predator removal studies provide valuable information on the demographic response of birds and can assist conservation practitioners with prioritizing invasive predator removal projects. We review such studies focusing on observed demographic responses of bird populations to predator removal campaigns and whether ecological factors are useful in predicting those responses. From the 800 predator removal programs indentified a small fraction (n equals 112) reported demographic responses of bird populations. Change in productivity was the most commonly reported response which on average increased by 25.3 PeRcEnT (2.5 SE) with predator removal. The best supported model for predicting the change in productivity from predator removal incorporated bird body mass egg mass predator type nest type and an interaction term for body mass and nest type (AIC(c) weight equals 0.457). The predicted percent increase in productivity resulting from hypothetical predator removal ranged from 16.9 to 63.0 PeRcEnT (mean equals 45.0 5.6 SE) and was lowest for large surface nesting birds such as albatrosses. The predicted increase in productivity resulting from predator removal alone was insufficient to reverse the predicted population decline for 30 67 PeRcEnT of bird species considered suggesting that in many cases removal of predators must be performed in combination with other conservation actions in order to ensure a stable or increasing population. 235:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biologists have long sought a means by which to quantify similarities and differences in embryonic development across species. Here we present a quantitative approach for predicting the timing of developmental events based on principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics. Data from diverse oviparous species support model predictions that most variation in the time required to reach one early developmental stage the time to first heartbeat is explained by the body size and temperature dependence of metabolic rate. Furthermore comparisons of this stage with later developmental stages suggest that after correcting for size and temperature the relationship of metabolic rate to the rate of embryogenesis is approximately invariant across taxonomic groups and stages of ontogeny. 240:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,240:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The genetic basis of population colonization is poorly understood particularly in animals. Here I introduce the idea of a catapult effect to explain how the effects of transient increases in fitness can be retained in population demography diminishing the chance of extinction. I tested this idea using information on historical introductions of hybrid and non hybrid pheasants in the United States. I found that hybrid pheasants were 2.2 times more likely to establish than non hybrid strains. Analysis of fitness components failed to support the alternative that the increased odds of establishment resulted from increased genetic variation conferring permanent fitness benefits through directional selection or by purging deleterious alleles. These results show that even ephemeral increases in fitness can affect the persistence of small populations. 246:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,254:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,269:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,283:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The peer review model is one of the most important tools used in science to assess the relative merit of research. We manipulated a published article to reflect one of the following four author designations: female male initial and no name provided. This article was then reviewed by referees of both genders at various stages of scientific training. Name changing did not influence acceptance rates or quality ratings. Undergraduate referees were less critical than graduate students or postdoctoral researchers independent of gender. However; female postdoctoral researchers were the most critical referees: Their rejection rates were the highest and quality ratings the lowest regardless of the author name provided. Contrary to previous reports in the literature there was no evidence of same gender preferences. This study strongly suggests that female postgraduate biologists may apply different expectations to peer review. 311:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,332:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Multiple factors acting on different life stages influence population dynamics and complicate the assessment and management of populations. To provide appropriate management advice the data should be used to determine which factors are important and what life stages they impact. It is also important to consider density dependence because it can modify the impact of some factors. We develop a state space multistage life cycle model that allows for density dependence and environmental factors to impact different life stages. Models are ranked using a two covariates at a time stepwise procedure based on AIC(c) model averaging to reduce the possibility of excluding factors that are detectable in combination but not alone. Impact analysis is used to evaluate the impact of factors on the population. The framework is illustrated by application to delta smelt (Hyposmesus transpacificus) a threatened species that is potentially impacted by multiple anthropogenic factors. Our results indicate that density dependence and a few key factors impact the delta smelt population. Temperature prey and predators dominated the factors supported by the data and operated on different life stages. The included factors explain the recent declines in delta smelt abundance and may provide insight into the cause of the pelagic species decline in the San Francisco Estuary. 343:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the process of recruitment is fundamental to fisheries biology and management. However recruitment in natural populations is highly variable and rarely well described by classical stock recruitment relationships (SRRs). Recent analyses suggest that the age composition of the spawning biomass may play an important role in the mismatch between SRRs and data. Here we develop a generalization of the Ricker SRR that incorporates age structure by allowing mortality and fecundity rates to depend on maternal age. We provide a flexible SRR with biologically interpretable parameters that can be estimated from existing fisheries time series and use a Bayesian framework that enables parameters to be informed by experimental data. We apply our method to the Icelandic population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and show models that include age structure effects outperform the classical Ricker SRR that ignores age structure. Our results indicate a strong effect of spawning stock age structure on recruitment dynamics in this population. Our approach provides a biologically interpretable and immediately applicable method for investigating the consequences for spawning stock age structure on recruitment. 345:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We describe a simple scheme for the management of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) population aggregates that uses reference points derived from an empirical analysis of freshwater production data. We fit a rectilinear   hockey stick   model to 14 historical data sets of female spawner abundance and resulting smolt production and found that at low spawner abundance the average productivity was about 85 smolts per female spawner. Variation in productivity among streams may be related to the quality of the stream habitat. We show how freshwater productivity can be combined with forecasts of marine survival to provide a limit reference point harvest rate. Our method will permit harvest rates to track changes in ocean productivity. We also used the historical data to estimate that on average a density of 19 female spawners.km( 1) is required to fully seed freshwater habitats with juveniles. However there was considerable variation among the streams that might limit the utility of this measure as a reference point. Uncertainty in the forecasts of marine survival and other parameters needs to be incorporated into our scheme before it can be considered a precautionary approach. 367:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,371:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,39:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, All organisms alter their abiotic environment but ecosystem engineers are species with abiotic effects that may have to be explicitly accounted for when making predictions about population and community dynamics. The goal of this analysis is to identify those conditions in which engineering leads to population dynamics that are qualitatively different than one would predict using models that incorporate only biotic interactions. We present a simple model coupling an ecosystem engineer and the abiotic environment. We assume that the engineer alters environmental conditions at a rate dependent on engineer density and that the environment decays back to original conditions at an exponential rate. We determine when the feedback to population dynamics through environmental state can lead to altered equilibrium densities bistability or runaway growth of the engineer population. The conditions leading to changes in dynamics such as susceptibility of a system to engineering or alteration of density dependent and density independent controls define cases in which the engineering concept is essential for ecological understanding. 404:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,40:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,422:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The US. Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that recovery plans include specific criteria to determine when a species should be removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. To meet this mandate we developed a new approach to determining classification criteria for long lived vertebrates The key idea is that endangerment depends on two critical aspects of a population: population size and trends in population size due to intrinsic variability in population growth rates. The way to combine these features is to identify a population size and range of population growth rates (where lambda denotes the annual multiplicative rate of change of a population) above which there is a negligible probability of extinction. To do so (1) information on the current population size and its variance is specified; (2) available information on vital rates or changes in abundance over time is used to generate a probability distribution for the populations lambda; (3) the lower fifth percentile value for lambda (denoted as lambda((0.05)))is obtained from the frequency distribution of lambda s and (4) if lambda((0.05)) is  1.0 a backwards population trajectory starting at 500 individuals for a period of 10 years is performed and the resulting population size is designated as the threshold for listing a species as endangered or if lambda((0.05)) is greater than or equal to 1.0 the threshold for endangerment is set at 500 animals. A similar approach can be used to determine the threshold for listing a species as threatened under the ESA. We applied this approach to North Pacific humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used Monte Carlo simulations to produce a frequency distribution of lambda s for the whales under three different scenarios. Using lambda((0.05)) it was determined that the best estimates of current abundance for the central population of North Pacific humpback whales were larger than the estimated threshold for endangered status but less than the estimated threshold for threatened status if accepted by the responsible management agency this analysis would be consistent with a recommendation to downlist the central stock of humpback whales to a status of threatened whereas the status of eastern and western stocks would remain endangered. 423:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,445:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Long term demographic surveys needed to obtain accurate information on population dynamics and efficiently manage rare species are still very scarce. Matrix population models are useful tools to identify key demographic transitions and thus help setting up conservation actions. Furthermore the combination of ecological demographic and genetic data is likely to improve the identification of the threats acting upon populations and help conservation decisions. In this paper we illustrate the power of this approach on Brassica insularis a Mediterranean endemic plant species rare and endangered in Corsica (France). In four populations of this species a long term demographic survey (2000 2009) genetic analyses (in 2000 and 2009) and survey of ecological variables (climatic variables competition and herbivory) were performed. By using both deterministic and stochastic matrix model analyses we assessed the viability of each population and tested for both spatial and temporal variations in demographic vital rates. Populations exhibited differing demographic behaviours and environmental stochasticity occurred in populations. Significant correlations between climatic variables and vital rates were detected. Stochastic simulations suggested that three out of the four populations studied might present a high risk of extinction on the short term and should actively be managed or at least surveyed. It could be however that two of these populations are experiencing density dependent regulation rather than being declining. Microsatellite diversity was slightly reduced in a single population and similar in the three others consistently with expectations based on population census size and geographic area as well as with diversity at the S locus observed in 2000. The combination of all data led to specific recommendations for managing each population. We discuss the implications for conservation of such a general approach. 453:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite years of effort from behavioral ecologists animal behavior has not been fully integrated into the field of conservation biology. We propose a novel framework to join these fields through the use of demographic models. We present three strategies for incorporating behavior in demographic models outline the costs of each strategy through decision analysis and build on previous work in behavioral ecology and demography. We then provide practical recommendations for applying this framework to management programs. First relevant behavioral mechanisms should be included in demographic models used for conservation decision making. Second rapid behavioral assessment is a useful tool to approximate demographic parameters through regression of demographic phenomena on observations of related behaviors. Behaviorally estimated parameters may be included in population viability analysis for use in management. Finally behavioral indices can be used as indicators of population trends. Rapid behavioral assessment holds promise as a cost effective tool but also represents a cost to model accuracy. We provide a framework for implementing rapid behavioral assessment through case studies of reproductive foraging and antipredator behaviors. We use a decision theoretic approach to provide quantitative rules for identifying when metrics of animal behavior may be more meaningful than traditional population assessment. 466:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,512:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation practitioners use demographic population viability analysis (PVA) to understand long term effects of changing demographic rates on population growth rate. Sensitivities and elasticities of stage specific survival and fertility rates provide managers with guidelines on the relative contributions of various life history stages to long term population growth. However short term patterns especially single year effects of elasticity may be dramatically different from long term effects calling for caution in implementing management policies focusing entirely on only long or short term elasticities. Here we illustrate the temporal and spatial variation in elasticity patterns for four populations of California sea lions. Short term stochastic elasticities were significantly different from long term elasticities and spatial patterns of short and long term elasticities varied across sites. These differences may be explained by transient effects in age structure and deviations from the stable age distribution as well as environmental variation. Our results suggest that conservation practitioners should consider calculations of both short and long term elasticity in viability analyses that are used to guide management and should use caution in generalizing elasticity patterns across populations. 513:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Controlling species invasions is a leading problem for applied ecology. While controlling populations expanding linearly or exponentially is straightforward intervention in systems with complex dynamics can have complicated and sometimes counterintuitive consequences. Most invasive plant populations are stage structured and density dependent a recipe for complex dynamics and yet few population models have been created to explore the effects of control efforts on such species. We examined the demography of the invasive biennial plant Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) on the front of its spread into a natural area and found evidence of strong density dependence in vital rates of first year rosette and second year adult stage classes. We parameterized a density dependent stage structured projection model using field collected data. This model produces two point cycles with alternating years in which adults vs. rosettes are more prevalent. Such population dynamics match observations in natural populations suggesting that these complicated population dynamics may result from deterministic rules. We used this model to evaluate simulated management strategies including herbicide treatment of rosettes and clipping or pulling of adult plants. Management of A. petiolata by inducing mortality of either rosettes or adults will not be effective at reducing population density unless the induced mortality is very high ( 95 PeRcEnT for rosettes and  85 PeRcEnT for adults) and repeated every year. Indeed induced mortality of rosettes can be counterproductive causing increases in the stationary distribution of A. petiolata density. This species is typical of many invasive plants (stage structured short lived high fertility) and exhibits common forms of density dependence. Thus the management implications of our study should apply broadly to other species with similar life histories. We suggest that management should focus on managing adults rather than rosettes and on creating efficient control in targeted areas of the population rather than spreading less efficient efforts widely. 518:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Currently there are no generally recognized approaches for linking detailed mortality and pathology data to population level analyses of extinction risk. We used a combination of analytical and simulation based analyses to examine 20 years of age and sex specific mortality data for southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and we applied results to project the efficacy of alternative conservation strategies. Population recovery of the southern sea otter has been slow (rate of population increase lambda equals 1.05) compared to other recovering populations (lambda equals 1.17 1.20) and the population declined (lambda equals 0.975) between 1995 and 1999. Age based Leslie matrices were developed to explore explanations for the slow recovery and recent decline in the southern sea other population. An elasticity analysis was performed to predict effects of proportional changes in stage specific reproductive or survival rates on the rate of population increase. A life stage simulation analysis (LSA) was developed to evaluate the impact of changing age and cause specific mortality rates on lambda. The information used to develop these models was derived from death assemblage pathology and live population census data to examine the sensitivity of sea otter population growth to different sources of mortality  disease and starvation direct human take fisheries gun shot boat strike oil pollution mating trauma and intraspecific aggression shark bites and unknowns. We used resampling simulations to generate random combinations of vital rates for a large number of matrix replicates and drew on these to estimate potential effects of mortality sources on population growth (lambda). Our analyses suggest management actions that are likely and unlikely to promote recovery of the southern sea otter and more broadly indicate a methodology to better utilize cause of death data in conservation decision making. 523:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Estimating parameters for population dynamics models is a critical component in assessing extinction probabilities of populations. For many individual populations key parameters will be poorly defined and meta analysis would provide a basis for estimating the parameters. Here we introduce meta analytical techniques to estimate the maximum reproductive rate carrying capacity and depensation in coho salmon on the west coast of North America. We used both nonlinear mixed effects models and Bayesian techniques to estimate several population dynamics models including the Beverton Holt and hockey stick models for 14 spawner recruitment time series. The Beverton Holt and hockey stick mixed effects models yielded equivalent fits to the data but gave very different estimates of alpha (the maximum rate at which female spawners can produce female smolts at low population sizes). The mean alpha for the Beverton Holt mixed effect model was 71.5 (1 SE equals 1.2) female smolts per spawning female whereas the hockey stick estimate was 53.0 (I SE equals 1.14). We found little evidence for a general effect of depensation in coho salmon unless fewer than one female per kilometer of river returned to spawn. 547:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,552:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,554:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,568:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,576:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,578:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We quantified the reliability of phytoplankton population community and ecosystem variates as indicators of whole lake enrichment. Variates with high sensitivity to perturbation and low background variability were assumed to be more reliable indicators than variates with low sensitivity or high variability. Our data set included weekly data in four lakes (three manipulated and one reference) during two pretreatment summers and two summers of enrichment. We determined background variability by evaluating change in each variate from year to year in the reference lake throughout the experiment and in each manipulated lake during the pretreatment period. We evaluated sensitivity to enrichment using the frequency of departure from expected conditions for each variate during the period of experimental enrichment. Using this information we then (1) tested the expectation that species populations are more reliable indicators of perturbation than ecosystem variates (biomass chlorophyll and primary productivity) and (2) evaluated whether community variates (genera taxonomic divisions allometric variates and community diversity) were reliable indicators of enrichment. Contrary to expectations from other perturbations phytoplankton species populations were less reliable indicators of enrichment than community and ecosystem variates. Chlorophyll species diversity and species evenness were the most reliable indicators of enrichment: each changed significantly only during the first year of enrichment and only in the three enriched lakes. Simultaneous changes in multiple taxonomic divisions also signaled enrichment very reliably. In contrast the frequency of significant changes in species populations differed little between the reference lake and the enriched lakes even after experimental enrichment. Changes in species were difficult to detect reliably due to high background variability in all four lakes: most taxa were not present often enough during a single year to assess reliably whether they had increased or decreased compared to the previous years. Genera and allometric variates were also unreliable indicators due to high variability and moderate sensitivity respectively. Reliable indicators of phytoplankton responses to enrichment were very different from reliable indicators of animal responses to toxic stressors suggesting that it may be difficult to make generalizations regarding the use of population community and ecosystem variates as indicators of a wide array of perturbations. 58:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the universality of branching patterns in marine modular colonial organisms there is neither a clear explanation about the growth of their branching forms nor an understanding of how these organisms conserve their shape during development. This study develops a model of branching and colony growth using parameters and variables related to actual modular structures  branches) in Caribbean gorgonian corals (Cnidaria). Gorgonians exhibiting treelike networks branch subapically creating hierarchical mother daughter relationships among branches. We modeled both the intrinsic subapical branching along with an ecological physiological limit to growth or maximum number of mother branches (k). Shape is preserved by maintaining a constant ratio (c) between the total number of branches and the mother branches. The size frequency distribution of mother branches follows a scaling power law suggesting self organized criticality. Differences in branching among species with the same k values are determined by r ( branching rate) and c. Species with r   c had a sigmoid logistic like growth with a long asymptotic period before reaching k. Gorgonians exhibit c and r values in the range of the conditions for a stable equilibrium (c   r 2 or c  r  0). Ecological physiological constraints limit growth without altering colony form or the interaction between r and c. The model described the branching dynamics giving the form to colonies and how colony growth declines over time without altering the branching pattern. This model provides a theoretical basis to study branching as a simple function of the number of branches independently of ordering and bifurcation based schemes. 601:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Previous studies have synthesized life table data from herbivore species to identify general trends in the demography of herbivorous insects. Frequency based analyses were used to ascertain which of five mortality sources (enemies plant factors competition weather intrinsic developmental failure) and which of five ecological characteristics of herbivores (feeding biology invasion status of the herbivore latitude cultivation and successional status of the habitat) had important influences on mortality patterns. Here these results are reinforced with a quantitative analysis that relies on actual numbers of herbivores killed at different developmental stages by each of the five mortality sources in different ecological settings. We also examine the relationship between taxonomic category (Coleoptera Diptera Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera) and mortality. The analysis identified developmental changes of herbivores as having an important influence on sources of mortality; feeding biology latitude and cultivation status also influenced the distribution of mortality sources. Other aspects of the herbivores ecology and taxonomy had limited effects. Natural enemies were identified as the most important mortality source overall and their importance increased from the early larval stages to the pupal stages. They also kill more exophytic insects than endophytic insects and kill a higher proportion of insects in cultivated habitats than in natural habitats. Weather kills more temperate zone immatures than tropical subtropical immatures. The results of the quantitative analysis generally confirm the earlier frequency based tests. Several predictions that can serve as the foundation of an empirically based theory of herbivore demography are offered: (1) natural enemies are the dominant cause of mortality in exophytic herbivore populations and may compete more intensely than on endophytics; (2) plant factors and enemies play a more balanced role in endophytic populations; (3) exophytic species should be particularly susceptible to top down effects especially in agroecosystems; (4) plant defences will often have sublethal effects but when they are lethal they will be most important as the hatchling larva is just getting established on the plant. These predictions should be viewed as a challenge to engage in a broader way of thinking about herbivore demography. 63:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Hermaphroditism is typically associated with a sedentary existence whereas dioecy is associated with mobility. This pattern is reflected within flowering plants as dioecious species commonly possess traits that promote high dispersal. We investigated these associations with three population dynamics models (an individual based simulation and two mathematical models one deterministic and the other stochastic) that allowed us to examine competition for space between a hermaphroditic and dioecious species from different perspectives. The competing species are identical in every way but their sexual system. Separation of the sexes increases the variances of pollen import and seed dispersal for the dioecious species. These variances propagate through subsequent reproductive processes and ultimately reduce mean recruitment as a result of nonlinear averaging (Jensens inequality). A dioecious species could overcome this disadvantage simply by producing more gametes than hermaphrodites; however in line with the association with mobility selection on dioecious species should also favor traits that reduce reproductive uncertainty such as extensive dispersal. 647:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,64:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,64:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In a stochastic environment long term fitness can be influenced by variation covariation and serial correlation in vital rates (survival and fertility). Yet no study of an animal population has parsed the contributions of these three aspects of variability to long term fitness. We do so using a unique database that includes complete life history information for wild living individuals of seven primate species that have been the subjects of long term (22 45 years) behavioral studies. Overall the estimated levels of vital rate variation had only minor effects on long term fitness and the effects of vital rate covariation and serial correlation were even weaker. To explore why we compared estimated variances of adult survival in primates with values for other vertebrates in the literature and found that adult survival is significantly less variable in primates than it is in the other vertebrates. Finally we tested the prediction that adult survival because it more strongly influences fitness in a constant environment will be less variable than newborn survival and we found only mixed support for the prediction. Our results suggest that wild primates may be buffered against detrimental fitness effects of environmental stochasticity by their highly developed cognitive abilities social networks and broad flexible diets. 654:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A change in population density can generate spatial and demographic effects that can have an impact on fluctuations in population Size for many years. Although the demographic effects of time lags have been incorporated into analyses of time series data there are few detailed descriptions of the long term demographic consequences of a change in density. We use detailed individual based data from a population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) from the North Block of the Isle of Rum Scotland to describe long term demographic and spatial effects of a change in density. The population was released from hunting pressure in 1972. Over the following 10 years population density doubled and since the early 1980s has fluctuated around ecological carrying capacity. The cessation of culling led to long term transient spatial and demographic effects that have persisted for 30 years. Different vital rates responded to the increase in density at different rates causing long term changes to the demographic and spatial structure of the population. These changes altered the impact of different age and sex specific vital rates on annual changes in population size. These changes are still ongoing 30 years after cessation of the cull suggesting that a change in density may generate transient dynamics that persist for several generations. 660:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although ecologists were among the first scientists to study the implications of chaotic dynamics there is still no widely accepted example of chaos in a field population. If current developments in nonlinear dynamics are to be of relevance to population ecology however it is necessary to determine whether chaos occurs in nature. Here we bring together two lines of evidence suggesting that the dynamics of vole populations in northern Fennoscandia may be chaotic: nonlinear analysis of time series data and a model based on biological mechanisms. We review how a mechanistic population model can be used to produce short term population forecasts even when one of the species is not observed and then use this benchmark of model accuracy to support our choice of a mechanistic population model for vole dynamics.By adjusting model parameters to optimise the forecasting accuracy on the vole time series we can obtain parameter estimates for the model. In tests on simulated data this new approach to parameter estimation for stochastic dynamic models yields parameter estimates such that the fitted model produces dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed. However some parameters are poorly identified  many different parameter combinations yield nearly identical model dynamics). For the best fit parameters the model dynamics are characterized by quasi chaotic behavior; the global Lyapunov exponent is very close to (and statistically undistinguishable from) zero but the median local Lyapunov exponent is significantly positive. Our findings of recurrent short term chaos suggest that vole dynamics in northern Fennoscandia are characterized by a blend of order and irregularity. The irregularity is the same type as would occur in a noisy chaotic system  exogenous noise amplification by sensitive dependence on initial conditions) but only occurs during specific portions of the oscillation. 673:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Both means and year to year variances of climate variables such as temperature and precipitation are predicted to change. However the potential impact of changing climatic variability on the fate of populations has been largely unexamined. We analyzed multiyear demographic data for 36 plant and animal species with a broad range of life histories and types of environment to ask how sensitive their long term stochastic population growth rates are likely to be to changes in the means and standard deviations of vital rates (survival reproduction growth) in response to changing climate. We quantified responsiveness using elasticities of the long term population growth rate predicted by stochastic projection matrix models. Short lived species (insects and annual plants and algae) are predicted to be more strongly (and negatively) affected by increasing vital rate variability relative to longer lived species (perennial plants birds ungulates). Taxonomic affiliation has little power to explain sensitivity to increasing variability once longevity has been taken into account. Our results highlight the potential vulnerability of short lived species to art increasingly variable climate but also suggest that problems associated with short lived undesirable species (agricultural pests disease vectors invasive weedy plants) may be exacerbated in regions where climate variability decreases. 67:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Life history theory makes several key predictions about reproductive strategies on the basis of demographic vital rates particularly the relationship between juvenile and adult survival. Two such predictions concern the optimal time to begin reproducing and whether semelparity or iteroparity is favored. I tested these life history predictions and explored how they might differ between the native and introduced ranges of the monocarpic perennial Cynoglossum officinale. I first compared vital rates between ranges. I then used these vital rates to parameterize integral projection models to calculate the population growth rate (lambda) and net reproductive rate (R(0)) as surrogates for fitness to compare strategies within and between ranges. I found that both survival and growth were higher in the introduced range where size at flowering was larger and iteroparity was much more common than in the native range. The observed and predicted strategies for size at flowering were similar in the native range. In the introduced range however even though plants flowered at a larger size the observed size was not as large as the optimum predicted by lambda or the higher optimum predicted by R(0). Iteroparity conferred higher fitness in both ranges as measured by both fitness metrics suggesting that severe constraints potentially specialist herbivores prevent this strategy from becoming more common in the native range. 709:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Integral projection models (IPMs) are increasingly being applied to study size structured populations. Here we call attention to a potential problem in their construction that can have important consequences for model results. IPMs are implemented using an approximating matrix and bounded size range. Individuals near the size limits can be unknowingly   evicted   from the model because their predicted future size is outside the range. We provide simple measures for the magnitude of eviction and the sensitivity of the population growth rate (lambda) to eviction allowing modelers to assess the severity of the problem in their IPM. For IPMs of three plant species we found that eviction occurred in all cases and caused underestimation of the population growth rate (k) relative to eviction free models; it is likely that other models are similarly affected. Models with frequent eviction should be modified because eviction is only possible when size transitions are badly mis specified. We offer several solutions to eviction problems but we emphasize that the modeler must choose the most appropriate solution based on an understanding of why eviction occurs in the first place. We recommend testing IPMs for eviction problems and resolving them so that population dynamics are modeled more accurately. 70:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many flowering plants rely on pollinators self fertilization or both for reproduction. We model the consequences of these features for plant population dynamics and mating system evolution. Our mating systems based population dynamics model includes an Allee effect. This often leads to an extinction threshold defined as a density below which population densities decrease. Reliance on generalist pollinators who primarily visit higher density plant species increases the extinction threshold whereas autonomous modes of selfing decrease and can eliminate the threshold. Generalist pollinators visiting higher density plant species coupled with autonomous selfing may introduce an effect where populations decreasing in density below the extinction threshold may nonetheless persist through selfing. The extinction threshold and selfing at low density result in populations where individuals adopting a single reproductive strategy exhibit mating systems that depend on population density. The ecological and evolutionary analyses provide a mechanism where prior selfing evolves even though inbreeding depression is greater than one half. Simultaneous consideration of ecological and evolutionary dynamics confirms unusual features (e. g. evolution into extinction or abrupt increases in population density) implicit in our separate consideration of ecological and evolutionary scenarios. Our analysis has consequences for understanding pollen limitation reproductive assurance and the evolution of mating systems. 714:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Long distance dispersal has many consequences. One of these is the speed with which a population can invade a new habitat. This invasion wave speed can be calculated from information on demography (in the form of a stage structured matrix population model) and dispersal (in the form of a distribution of stage specific dispersal distances). Wave speed complements population growth rate (lambda) as an index of population performance in conservation biology. Here we present a new. way to calculate the sensitivity of wave speed to changes in short and long distance dispersal indeed to dispersal at any distance using the order statistics of the dispersal distribution. This makes it possible to examine the effects of changing the distance dispersed by the longest dispersing individual the shortest the median individual etc. We apply the method to data on the Pied Flycatcher in the Netherlands the Starling in the United States and the Sparrowhawk in England and the Netherlands. We find that wave speed is vastly more sensitive to changes in the uppermost percentiles of the dispersal distribution than to changes elsewhere. The sensitivity results make it possible to carry out life table response experiment (LTRE) calculations which quantify the contribution of demography short distance dispersal and long distance dispersal to interpopulation differences in wave speed. We find that 30 PeRcEnT of the difference in wave speed between the Pied Flycatcher and the Starling is due to demography and about 70 PeRcEnT to dispersal. Most of the dispersal effects come from the top 10 PeRcEnT of the dispersal distribution. In contrast 86 PeRcEnT of the difference in wave speed between the two populations of Sparrowhawks is due to differences in demography and about 14 PeRcEnT to differences in dispersal. Again most of the dispersal effects are due to the upper percentiles of the dispersal distribution. The patterns revealed in the analysis of the four populations are very similar suggesting that the dependence of wave speed on long distance dispersal may exhibit common patterns of sensitivity and elasticity. 737:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Population models in ecology are rarely validated by comparing their predictions to long term observations of changes in population size. We have used a variety of analytical tools to examine a 45 year time series of annual censuses of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) in the Gran Paradiso National Park in northwestern Italy. This ibex population grew from about 3300 to almost 5000 individuals in the 1980s during a decade of anomalously mild winters and then began to decline in the 1990s. By 1997 the population size had returned to previous levels. Adult survival apparently increased and adult sex ratio may have changed to slightly favor males during the increase in population density. Yearly changes in total population were correlated with seasonal average snow depth and population density over the 39 years for which climate data were available. Our results show that the ibex population size was limited by both density dependence and deep snow. A model based on these factors fit to the first 19 years of data was used to forecast subsequent changes in total population based on initial population size and yearly snow depth. The model was able to predict the increase and subsequent decline in total population size over the final 20 years of the study but failed to reproduce population levels after the eruption. Our results suggest that the 1980s episode of population growth was primarily driven by increased adult survival rather than increased recruitment. 741:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predicting population extinctions is a key element of quantitative conservation biology and population ecology. Although stochastic population theories have long been used to obtain theoretical distributions of population extinction times model based predictions have rarely been tested. Here I report results from a quantitative analysis of extinction time in 281 experimental populations of water fleas (Daphnia magna) in variable environments. To my knowledge this is the first quantitative estimate of the shape of the distribution of population extinction times based on extinction data for any species. The finding that the distribution of population extinction times was extraordinarily peaked is consistent with theoretical predictions for density independent populations but inconsistent with predictions for density dependent populations. The tail of the extinction time distribution was not exponential. These results imply that our current theories of extinction are inadequate. Future work should focus on how demographic stochasticity scales with population size and effects of nonrandom variable environments on population growth and decline. 74:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mate finding which is essential to both population growth and gene exchange involves both spatial and temporal components. From a population dynamics perspective spatial mate finding problems are well studied and decreased mate finding efficiency at low population densities is a well recognized mechanism for the Allee effect. Temporal aspects of mate finding have been rarely considered but reproductive asynchrony may engender an Allee effect in which some females go mateless by virtue of temporal isolation. Here we develop and explore a model that unifies previously disparate theoretical considerations of spatial and temporal aspects of mate finding. Specifically we develop a two sex reaction diffusion system to examine the interplay between reproductive asynchrony and the dispersal of individuals out of a patch. We also consider additional behavioral complications including several alternative functional forms for mating efficiency and advective movements in which males actively seek out females. By calculating the fraction of females expected to go mateless as a joint function of reproductive asynchrony and patch size we find that the population level reproductive rates necessary to offset female matelessness may be quite high. These results suggest that Allee effects engendered by reproductive asynchrony will be greatly exacerbated in spatially isolated populations. 763:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The presence of direct and delayed density dependence in populations of three sympatric rodent species (Clethrionomys rufocanus Apodemus speciosus and A. argenteus) in Hokkaido Japan was evaluated using triannual census data (spring summer and fall) spanning 30 years (1963 1992) on 79 populations for each species. The average abundance and population variability (the s index) generally increased from spring to fall in C. rufocanus but were typically highest in summer for the Apodemus populations. Based on a comprehensive and comparative review of the population and community biology of the species we made four explicit predictions about the pattern of density dependence: (1) the three species were expected to exhibit socially induced direct density dependence but 12) this was expected to be weaker in the Apodemus species than C. rufocanus; (3) delayed density dependence caused by predation was only expected in C. rufocanus; thus (4) time series of C. rufocanus were expected to reflect a second order dynamic process and those of the Apodemus species were expected to reflect a first order process. Dennis and Tapers method based on the Gompertz model was used to test for direct and delayed density dependence and thereby to test the predictions. Direct density dependence was detected in most series (81.0 97.5 PeRcEnT) for all three seasons and for all three species. A significant proportion of the time series of C. rufocanus (11.8 18.5 PeRcEnT) exhibited negative delayed density dependence whereas detection rates in the two Apodemus species did not differ from that expected by chance alone. Autoregressive analyses corroborated this: a second order process was commonly found to be the appropriate model for the time series of C rufocanus whereas a first order process was preferred for most time series of the Apodemus species. The high incidence of direct density dependence in all three species and the contrasting results on delayed density dependence between C. rufocanus and the Apodemus species are discussed with reference to social and trophic interactions. Territoriality delayed maturation and reduced pregnancy rates are probable causes for the high incidence of direct density dependence in all species. The more unpredictable variability in Apodemus food resource is argued to have a potential to disrupt social regulation and thus to lower the incidence of direct density dependence. A candidate mechanism for the incidence of delayed density dependence is differential vulnerability to predation: the demography of C. rufocanus is much more affected by predators than Apodemus. 764:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The relationship between individual performance and nonrandom use of habitat is fundamental to ecology; however empirical tests of this relationship remain limited especially for higher orders of selection like that of the home range. We quantified the association between lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and variables describing lifetime home ranges during the period of maternal care (spring to autumn) for 77 female roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) at Trois Fontaines Champagne Ardenne France (1976 2000). We maintained population growth rate (adjusted to account for removals of non focal animals) near r(max) which enabled us to de. ne the fitness habitat relationship in the absence of density effects. Using a negative binomial model we showed that a roe deers incorporation into its home range of habitat components important to food cover and edge (meadows thickets and increased density of road allowances) was significantly related to LRS. Further LRS decreased with increasing age of naturally reclaimed meadows at the time of a deers birth which may have reflected a cohort effect related to but not entirely explained by a decline in quality of meadows through time. Predictive capacity of the selected model estimated as the median correlation (r(s)) between predicted and observed LRS among deer of cross validation samples was 0.55. The strength of this relationship suggests that processes like selection of the site of a home range during dispersal may play a more important role in determining fitness of individuals than previously thought. Individual fitness of highly sedentary income breeders with high reproductive output such as roe deer should be more dependent on home range quality during the period of maternal care compared to capital breeders with low reproductive output. Identification of the most important habitat attributes to survival and reproduction at low density (low levels of intraspecific competition) may prove useful for de. ning habitat value (  intrinsic habitat value  ). 76:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,772:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The transition to piscivory is a crucial ontogenetic niche shift for many primarily piscivorous fishes. An early transition to piscivory may increase growth decrease mortality and therefore enhance lifetime fitness. Although much is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the shift to piscivory among species and among cohorts within a species little is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the switch to piscivory among individuals within a single cohort. Here I link otolith age and growth analysis to direct diet and stable isotope analyses to examine variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory and its causes among individual members of the 1994 largemouth bass cohort in Paul Lake Michigan. Stable isotope and direct diet analyses indicate that only a few members of the 1994 cohort were able to shift to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life (early piscivores) while most cohort members would have to wait until their second summer of life to become piscivorous (late piscivores). Significant differences in growth rate between early and late piscivores emerged shortly after 18 June the first date of possible piscivory by early piscivores after which early piscivores began to grow at rates nearly twice that of late piscivores. Otolith and stable isotope analyses combined indicate that an early hatching date was necessary but not sufficient to explain variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory. All early piscivores were hatched early in the summer but many early hatched members of the 1994 cohort did not shift to piscivory in their first summer of life. A combination of at least 10 days of variation in hatching dates and higher than average growth rates was required for early piscivores to switch to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life. Individuals that were able to make the early transition to piscivory most likely benefited from both increased survival and fecundity over much of their life the combination of which would confer a substantial fitness advantage upon individuals able to make the early transition to piscivory. 784:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Under the influence of natural and sexual selection males and females will often differ in the costs and benefits of achieving some particular body size; we might therefore expect to find them growing at different rates for different times and dying on different schedules. The analysis of sexual dimorphism presented here assumes that life histories are optimized over three key variables: activity level (or   effort  ) during the juvenile stage duration of the juvenile stage and size at maturation. Reproduction is taken to be semelparous (or monocarpic) reproductive success is size dependent and females are demographically dominant. Juvenile male and female life histories are assumed to be   structurally identical    governed by identical functions of activity size and development time). Under these conditions sexually dimorphic life histories readily arise when features of juvenile behavior and development are adjusted to maximize r in response to gender specific selection pressures on adults. Some conclusions from the analysis are as follows: 1) Seasonal constraints that force males and females to have equal development times cause differences between the sexes in other characteristics. 2) The survival cost of greater body size generates a sex ratio at maturation favoring the smaller sex consistent with much empirical evidence. 3) The relationships among size growth rate and development time can be represented graphically in a way that permits sexually dimorphic life histories to be depicted and compared. Cases considered here indicate considerable diversity among these patterns. 4) An allometric growth function is derived to facilitate graphical and mathematical analysis of body size. 5) The reproductive size quotient an indicator of reproductive potential relative to body size is defined and shown to be a significant life history characteristic. Except when mortality rate is strongly related to size at maturation or when generation time is fixed the reproductive size quotient should be maximized and these maxima should be the same for males and females. 787:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We analyzed 136 time series (covering from 44 to 73 yr) of juvenile cod to estimate the level of direct and delayed density dependent mortality (DDM) of 11 populations from the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. The parameters were estimated using a modeling approach that explicitly incorporates observation errors so that we could quantify the density independent (stochastic) variation in the survival of juvenile cod. Moderate to strong levels of DDM (direct or delayed) were estimated in eight of the 11 populations. Variability in the 0 group (corrected for observation errors) appeared to be large for most of the populations. Substantial stochastic variability in postsettlement survival was also detected in some areas indicating that stochastic factors are not only important for egg and larval stages as stated by the match mismatch hypothesis but also for juveniles. We show that the variability in these coastal populations is not only regulated as a function of the strength of DDM processes but also as an interaction between DDM processes and stochastic factors. We finally postulate that local and regional differences in the strengths of the density dependent and stochastic processes are related to differences in the quantity and quality of the bottom flora coverage which govern both food availability and shelter for juveniles. 798:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We used long term data on movements survival and reproduction of female red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus) of the Isle of Rum Scotland (1970 2001) to explain variation in life history (age at maturity) from a hinds access to habitat resources and exposure to local density and cross generational (maternal) effects on observed relationships. We described each hinds use of resources relative to availability in the study area from an individual based resource selection function (RSF); we defined local density as the total number of hinds aged   1 year within the subpopulation cluster to which an individual belonged. The likelihood of a hind producing her first calf in the period from birth to the end of the summer in which she turned age 3 was positively related to relative use of Agrostis Festuca grasslands and other low elevation communities and inversely related to a hinds mean annual local density. However when we considered both a daughters RSF and exposure to local density and her mothers RSF and exposure to local density maternal data alone most parsimoniously explained variation in age at maturity of daughters. Mothers were able to lower age at maturity in their daughters in two non mutually exclusive ways. First birth mass of daughters was inversely related to age at maturity and mothers that used relatively less uplands (Calluna dominated heath and heather moorland) and occupied areas of lower density produced larger offspring. Second mothers could establish a home range that enabled daughters to mature in areas with access to high quality Agrostis Festuca grasslands at low density. Lifetime reproductive success was inversely associated with a hinds age at maturity via extension of the reproductive life span. Longevity did not change in association with age at maturity. Patterns in how animals use available habitat resources may depend on that of previous generations especially at larger scales of resource selection. 79:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One hitherto intractable problem in studying mast seeding (synchronous intermittent heavy flowering by a population of perennial plants) is determining the relative roles of weather plant reserves and evolutionary selective pressures such as predator satiation. We parameterize a mechanistic resource based model for mast seeding in Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae) using a long term individually structured data set. Each plants energy reserves were reconstructed using annual inputs (growing degree days) outputs (flowering) and a novel regression technique. This allowed the estimation of the parameters that control internal plant resource dynamics and thereby allowed different models for masting to be tested against each other. Models based only on plant size season degree days and or climatic cues (warm January temperatures) fail to reproduce the pattern of autocovariation in individual flowering and the high levels of flowering synchrony seen in the field. This shows that resource matching or simple cue based models cannot account for this example of mast seeding. In contrast the resource based model pulsed by a simple climate cue accurately describes both individual level and population level aspects of the data. The fitted resource based model in the absence of environmental forcing has chaotic (but often statistically periodic) dynamics. Environmental forcing synchronizes individual reproduction and the models predict highly variable seed production in close agreement with the data. An evolutionary model shows that the chaotic internal resource dynamics as predicted by the fitted model is selectively advantageous provided that adult mortality is low and seeds survive for more than 1 yr both of which are true for C. pallens. Highly variable masting and chaotic dynamics appear to be advantageous in this case because they reduce seed losses to specialist seed predators while balancing the costs of missed reproductive events. 817:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although some organisms have moved to higher elevations and latitudes in response to recent climate change there is little consensus regarding the capacity of different species to track rapid climate change via range shifts. Understanding species abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus species with greater dispersal ability reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading edge range shifts and species traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg laying habitat in British Odonata. However models generally had low explanatory power. Thus even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management. Trait based range shift forecasts face several challenges including quantifying relevant natural history variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability. 838:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Generalizations describing how top down and bottom up processes jointly influence the production of offspring (recruitment) and the number of reproducing adults are lacking. This is a deficiency because (1) it is widely recognized that both top down and bottom up processes are common in ecosystems; and (2) the relationship between the number of individuals recruiting and number of reproductively active individuals present in that population is of fundamental importance in all branches of ecology. Here we derive a model to consider the joint effects of top down and bottom up forcing in any ecosystem. In general during the lifetime of a cohort bottom up effects are likely to limit recruitment over longer periods of time than top down effects. Top down effects are likely to be most important early in the life history when potential recruits are small in size and such effects will be more recognizable in small cohorts comprised of slowly growing individuals. 870:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Populations fluctuate because of their internal dynamics which can be nonlinear and stochastic and in response to environmental variation. Theory predicts how the colour of environmental stochasticity affects population means variances and correlations with the environment over time. The theory has not been tested for cycling populations commonly observed in field systems. We applied noise of different colours to cycling laboratory beetle populations holding other statistical properties of the noise fixed. Theory was largely validated but failed to predict observations in sufficient detail. The main period of population cycling was shifted up to 33 PeRcEnT by the colour of environmental stochasticity. Noise colour affected population means variances and dominant periodicities differently for populations that cycled in different ways without noise. Our results show that changes in the colour of climatic variability partly caused by humans may affect the main periodicity of cycling populations possibly impacting industry pest management and conservation. 877:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Regular cycles in population abundance are fascinating phenomena but are they common in natural populations? How are they distributed among taxa? Are there differences between different regions of the world or along latitudinal gradients? Using the new Global Population Dynamics Database we analysed nearly 700 long (25 years) time series of animal field populations looking for large scale patterns in cycles. Nearly 30 PeRcEnT of the time series were cyclic. Cycle incidence varied among taxonomic classes being most common in mammal and fish populations but only in fish did cycle incidence vary among orders. Cycles were equally common in European and North American populations but were more common in Atlantic fish than Pacific fish. The incidence of cycles increased with latitude in mammals only. There was no latitudinal gradient in cycle period but cycle amplitude declined with latitude in some groups of fish. Even after considering the biases in the data source and expected type I error population cycles seem common enough to warrant ecological attention. 89:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,918:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We investigate relationships between life history traits and the character of population dynamics as revealed by time series data. Our classification of time series is according to extinction category where we identify three classes of populations: (i) weakly varying populations with such high growth rates that long term persistence is likely (unless some extreme catastrophe occurs); (ii) populations with such low growth rates that average population size must be large to buffer them against extinction in a variable environment; and (iii) highly variable populations that fluctuate so dramatically that dispersal or some other refuge mechanism is likely to be key to their avoidance of extinction. Using 1941 time series representing 758 species from the Global Population Dynamics Database we find that depending on the form of density dependence one assumes between 46 and 90 PeRcEnT of species exhibit dynamics that are so variable that even large carrying capacities could not buffer them against extinction on a 100 year time horizon. The fact that such a large proportion of population dynamics are so locally variable vindicates the growing realization that dispersal habitat connectedness and large scale processes are key to local persistence. Furthermore for mammals simply by knowing body size age at first reproduction and average number of offspring we could correctly predict extinction categories for 83 PeRcEnT of species (60 of 72). 92:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Surprisingly little research has evaluated how habitat size may limit the population size of species that use different habitats at different stages of their lives. Here we develop simple discrete time models to describe the population dynamics of species that use separate juvenile and adult habitats. Analytic solutions model simulations and elasticity and sensitivity analyses show that adult abundance is only limited by the size of the juvenile habitat when both adult habitat size and recruitment are much larger than juvenile habitat size. Juvenile habitat plays a marginally greater role in limiting population size for species with closed populations where recruitment is proportional to adult abundance versus open populations. Because adult populations often accumulate pulses of juveniles adult habitat size can strongly limit population size over a broad range of parameter values an effect that increases as the longevity of a species increases. Limited empirical research from a range of taxa supports these model predictions although few studies were designed to actually test the limiting role of juvenile versus adult habitat. Future research must carefully evaluate whether and how processes at the juvenile stage affect adult abundance and conservation efforts may be able to use this model to evaluate the cost effectiveness vis a vis increasing adult abundance of time and money allocated to protecting juvenile habitats. 981:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most investigations of mate choice have focused on the outcomes of mate choice  which mates are chosen) and thus we generally know very little about how mates are chosen  how mates are found assessed and selected). Mate choice by females has been shown to be dependent on the state of the female with females being less selective when limited by time or energy. This result could be caused by changes in female mate assessment or mate selection behavior. We examined whether manipulations of time and energy affected the mate choice behavior of female threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We found that female mate choice behavior when not divided into stages was affected by both of the manipulations. This matches previous findings. When we divided female courtship behavior into six stages we found that the two manipulations affected different portions of the mate choice process. The holding time manipulation changed female behavior at the beginning and end of the mate choice process and the swimming manipulation changed female behavior only at the end of the mate choice process. Neither of the manipulations significantly affected female behavior in the middle portion of the mate choice process. Thus the mate choice process appears to be composed of multiple state dependent decisions. We discuss how a better mechanistic understanding of how female state affects female mate choice behavior can produce testable predictions and provide a basis for investigating the evolution of mating systems. 994:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Van Tienderen recently published a method that links selection gradients between a phenotypic trait and multiple fitness components with the effects of these fitness components on the population growth rate (mean absolute fitness). The method allows selection to be simultaneously estimated across multiple fitness components in a population dynamic framework. In this paper we apply the method to a population of red deer living in the North Block of the Isle of Rum Scotland. We show that (1) selection on birth date and birth weight can operate through multiple fitness components simultaneously; (2) our estimates of the response to selection are consistent with the observed change in trait values that we cannot explain with environmental and phenotypic covariates; (3) selection on both traits has fluctuated over the course of the study; (4) selection operates through different fitness components in different years; and (5) no environmental covariates correlate with selection because different fitness components respond to density and climatic variation in contrasting ways. 998:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Correlated genetic responses have been hypothesized as important components of fishery induced evolution although predictive data from wild populations have been difficult to obtain. Here we demonstrate substantial genetic correlations between a trait often subjected to fishery selection (adult body length) and traits that affect survival of larvae (length and swimming performance) in a wild population of a marine fish (bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus). Through both genetic covariance and size dependent maternal effects selection on adult size may cause a considerable correlated response in larval traits. To quantify how variation in larval traits may affect survival we introduce a flexible method that uses information from selection measurements to account for frequency dependence and estimate the relationship between phenotype and relative survival across a broad range of phenotypic values. Using this method we synthesize studies of selective mortality on larval size for eight species of fish and show that variation in larval size may result in considerable variation in larval survival. We predict that observed rates of fishery selection on adult marine fishes may substantially reduce larval size and survival. The evolution of smaller larvae in response to fishery selection may therefore have substantial consequences for the viability of fished populations. 1004:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A key issue in ecology is how patterns of species diversity differ as a function of scale. The scaling function is the species area curve. The form of the species area curve results from patterns of environmental heterogeneity and species dispersal and may be system specific. A central concern is how for a given set of species the species area curve varies with respect to a third variable such as latitude or productivity. Critical is whether the relationship is scale invariant  the species area curves for different levels of the third variable are parallel) rank invariant  the curves are non parallel but non crossing within the scales of interest) or neither in which case the qualitative relationship is scale dependent. This recognition is critical for the development and testing of theories explaining patterns of species richness because different theories have mechanistic bases at different scales of action. Scale includes four attributes: sample unit grain focus and extent. Focus is newly defined here. Distinguishing among these attributes is a key step in identifying the probable scale(s) at which ecological processes determine patterns. 1005:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  To study the effects of the sampling regime on body size range size correlations among species. Body size range size correlations tend to be positive if geographic sampling includes all or most of the geographic area of each species in a study. However correlations tend to be negative or non significant if geographic sampling is only partial. Using computer bootstrapping we randomly sampled latitudinal ranges of 1317 species of New World mammals. We sampled along lines of fixed longitude. We studied the effects of three variables: (1) the comprehensiveness of the sample as a proportion of the entire latitudinal range; (2) the number of isolated populations within a species range; (3) the correlation of body size and range size in the computerized data set from which the samples come. The latter is termed weak when we used the empirical body size and range size data. It was termed strong when we replaced the real body sizes with ones assigned to produce a correlation of one with range size. Studies using incomplete ranges yield unpredictable results that might not even get the sign of the relationship correct. The unpredictability arises because incomplete sampling tends to understate the range sizes of species with the largest ranges and miss the smallest ranges entirely. Those unusual range sizes determine the true body size range size correlation. The unpredictability worsens as more and more locations within a range lack a population thus increasing the probability that species will be missed by an incomplete sample. The degree of unpredictability caused by incomplete sampling and the number of isolated populations did not differ between the weak and strong data sets. 1011:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Numerous anthropological and ecological hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extinction of many large bodied mammals at the terminal Pleistocene. We find that body size distributions of all mammals in North America South America Africa and Australia before and after the late Pleistocene show a similar large size selectivity of extinctions across continents despite differences in timing. All extinctions coincide with the colonization of the continent by aboriginal man but only two coincide with periods of climate change. Further historical (within the last 300 years) extinctions in Australia demonstrate a higher susceptibility of small and medium sized mammals. On all four continents large bodied Recent mammals are threatened by human hunting practices whereas small bodied species are not. We conclude that the late Pleistocene extinctions were caused primarily by anthropogenic factors such as human hunting whereas historical extinctions were due mostly to habitat alteration and exotic species introductions. 1012:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Do elevational range size abundance. and body size patterns mirror those documented for geographic ranges? Data studied: Local and regional elevational ranges abundances and body sizes of Costa Rican rodents. Hypotheses: (1) Plotting elevational range against abundance will reveal a negative sloped. concave upward relationship (hollow Curve). (2) Elevational range sizes and geographic range sizes will be positively correlated. (3) Elevational range sizes will demonstrate a positive. linear trend with relative abundance. (4) Abundance will increase with rodent body size. and elevational range size will exhibit a triangular relationship with body size. (5) Abundances will peak near the elevational range midpoint. Elevational abundances followed hollow curves but elevational range sizes did not. Elevational and geographic range sizes were unrelated. Species with larger ranges had higher abundances although support was stronger regionally. Body size was not related either to elevational range size or to abundance at either scale. The highest abundances generally occurred somewhere in the middle of elevational ranges. but how close to the centre was highly variable. 1016:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  What is the distribution of sizes of bats when estimated from multivariate analyses conducted on a number of morphological characteristics? Can shapes generated from such analyses inform our understanding of macroecology in particular how phenotypic characteristics in general vary in nature? Do species rich functional groups of bats exhibit similar size and shape distributions? Quantitative methods: Principal components analysis imposed on seven morphometric characteristics. Kolmogorov Smirnov and bootstrap analyses to determine differences among phenotypic distributions. Organisms: New World bats. All distributions were modal skewed and deviated significantly from the log normal. Significant differences regarding central tendency of functional groups existed on all phenotypic axes. Functional groups exhibited similar size distributions based on skew and kurtosis but significantly differed on the log mass and shape axes. Although similarities in the unimodal and skewed nature of phenotypic distributions suggest universal properties governing the diversification of organisms through space and time quantitative differences among distributions highlight unique aspects of the evolution of particular phenotypic attributes. 1017:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Since flight imposes physical constraints on the attributes of a flying organism it is expected that the distribution of body sizes within clades of small bodied flying vertebrates should share a similar pattern that reflects these constraints. We examined patterns in similarities of body mass distributions among five clades of small bodied endothermic vertebrates (Passeriformes Apodiformes Trochiliformes Chiroptera Insectivora Rodentia) to examine the extent to which these distributions are congruent among the clades that fly as opposed to those that do not fly. The body mass distributions of three clades of small bodied flying vertebrates show significant divergence from the distributions of their sister clades. We examined two alternative hypotheses for similarities among the size frequency distributions of the five clades. The hypothesis of functional symmetry corresponds to patterns of similarity expected if body mass distributions of flying clades are constrained by similar or identical functional limitations. The hypothesis of phylogenetic symmetry corresponds to patterns of similarity expected if body mass distributions reflect phylogenetic relationships among clades. Empirically the clades with the most similar body mass distributions are the Passeriformes and Chiroptera a result inconsistent with similarities among distributions being attributable to phylogeny. However the other clade of flying species (Apodiformes Trochiliformes) was less similar to either Passeriformes or Chiroptera than was the Insectivora which is inconsistent with the pattern expected if body size distributions were influenced by constraints of flight. A test for phylogenetic symmetry indicated that the empirical pattern of similarity was statistically inconsistent with this hypothesis while a test for functional symmetry indicated that the empirical pattern was statistically consistent with this hypothesis though not perfectly congruent. Hence we conclude that there is evidence that functional constraints influence similarities in body mass distributions among species of distantly related taxa. 1018:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To assess the impacts of Pleistocene glaciation on the latitudinal diversity gradient I examined plant family diversity during the last interglacial at 24 sites in Europe between 39 degrees and 71 degrees N latitude. Familial richness and turnover were calculated for 1000 year intervals for each site. Although familial turnover varied from 6 to 59 PeRcEnT per 1000 years familial richness remained essentially constant at 16 (67 PeRcEnT) of the sites. For the remaining sites the rates of change of richness were very low (2 3 families per 1000 years) and were not associated with latitude. These results do not support historical hypotheses for the latitudinal diversity gradient because neither local species richness nor the slope of the gradient have changed meaningfully in the last 10 000 years. Instead they support hypotheses that invoke contemporary mechanisms to explain the inverse relationship between latitude and diversity. Additionally the lack of change both in richness at individual sites and in the latitudinal diversity gradient through time suggest that the ecological and evolutionary processes that regulate diversity within local communities operate in a systematic fashion across large spatial and temporal. scales. Future hypotheses for the latitudinal gradient of diversity should include universal rules that determine how resources are divided among species at local and global scales without regard to the identify of particular species. 1046:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In our recent letter we showed that papers with less than four authors but with a bigwig author (h index  35) among them had higher citation rates than papers with an equivalent number of authors but no bigwigs. This bigwig related benefit in citations was however not apparent for papers with four or more authors. We proposed two explanations for these intriguing findings: bigwigs enhanced citation rates by increased quality or relative merit of a paper or a name recognition effect (ie names of senior well established scientists attract citation as such). Both explanations are reasonable and equally likely. A lower level of contribution by the bigwigs in multi authored papers might explain why no bigwig benefit was observed for these papers. In a response to these findings Havens reiterates the first of these two explanations. We acknowledge this as one of at least two alternatives. The bigwig benefit may reflect both the actual quality of a study and the citation behavior of the community. The assumption that citation rates accurately reflect the importance and quality of work may not be as robust as is often assumed. Subjective factors not related to merit and quality such as nationality or status of institution can also influence citation rates. Havens proposes that bigwigs achieve status through contributions to a field and therefore the bigwig effect we describe simply reflects the increased quality of a study. This raises an interesting point: since we compared studies published in a single mid ranking journal (Oecologia) the papers published therein should ideally be comparable in terms of quality and merit and their citation rates should not differ depending on whether a bigwig is involved or not if bigwigs merely affect the actual merit. Moreover if the papers with bigwigs as authors are genuinely better why are they not always published in high status journals (ie if a bigwig always publishes exceptional work why do they sometimes publish in journals with varying impact?)? Furthermore the benefit of many (  4) authors supersedes the bigwig benefit which suggests that at least from a citation perspective having more authors either invokes another bias (how can that many people be wrong?) or makes papers even better in quality than those with bigwig authors. More importantly true progress in evaluating the relative merit of research published in our community should transcend merely counting up numerical measures. We propose that citations are not necessarily a perfect proxy for quality but a means to examine patterns of literature usage with the goal of increasing transparency in how we select and value one anothers work. The fact that bigwigs do not always publish in top tier journals should be obvious because everything tried and published is not always perfect but is sometimes riskier and thus arguably more useful to ecology regardless of the number of citations it accrues. 105:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We analyzed geographic patterns of richness in both the breeding and winter season in relation to a remotely sensed index of seasonal production (normalized difference vegetation index NDVI ) and to measures of habitat heterogeneity at four different spatial resolutions. The relationship between avian richness and NDVI was consistent between seasons suggesting that the way in which available energy is converted to bird species is similar at these ecologically distinct times of year. The number and proportion of migrant species in breeding communities also increased predictably with the degree of seasonality. The NDVI was a much better predictor of seasonal richness at finer spatial scales whereas habitat heterogeneity best predicted richness at coarser spatial resolutions. While we find strong support for a positive relationship between available energy and species richness seasonal NDVI explained at most 61 PeRcEnT of the variation in richness. Seasonal NDVI and habitat heterogeneity together explain up to 69 PeRcEnT of the variation in richness. 106:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examine Robert MacArthurs hypothesis that niche breadth is positively associated with latitude ( the latitude niche breadth hypothesis). This idea has been influential and long standing yet no studies have evaluated its generality or the validity of its assumptions. We review the theoretical arguments suggesting a positive relationship between niche breadth and latitude. We also use available evidence to evaluate the assumptions and predictions of MacArthurs latitude niche breadth hypothesis. We find that neither the assumptions nor the predictions of the hypothesis are supported by data. We propose an alternative hypothesis linking latitude with niche breadth. Unlike previous ideas our conceptual framework does not require equilibrial assumptions and is based on recently uncovered patterns of species interactions. 1110:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Climate change effects on biodiversity are already manifested and yet no predictive knowledge characterizes the likely nature of these effects. Previous studies suggested an influence of topography on these effects a possibility tested herein. Bird species with distributions restricted to montane (26 species) and Great Plains (19 species) regions of central and western North America were modeled and climate change effects on their distributions compared: in general plains species were more heavily influenced by climate change with drastic area reductions (mode 35 PeRcEnT of distributional area lost under assumption of no dispersal) and dramatic spatial movements (0 400 km shift of range centroid under assumption of no dispersal) of appropriate habitats. These results suggest an important generality regarding climate change effects on biodiversity and provide useful guidelines for conservation planning. 1143:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A global meta analysis was used to elucidate a mechanistic understanding of elevational species richness patterns of bats by examining both regional and local climatic factors spatial constraints sampling and interpolation. Based on these results I propose the first climatic model for elevational gradients in species richness and test it using preliminary bat data for two previously unexamined mountains. Global data set of bat species richness along elevational gradients from Old and New World mountains spanning 12.5 degrees S to 38 degrees N latitude. Bat elevational studies were found through an extensive literature search. Use was made only of studies sampling 70 PeRcEnT of the elevational gradient without significant sampling biases or strong anthropogenic disturbance. Undersampling and interpolation were explicitly examined with three levels of error analyses. The influence of spatial constraints was tested with a Monte Carlo simulation program Mid Domain Null. Preliminary bat species richness data sets for two test mountains were compiled from specimen records from 12 US museum collections. Equal support was found for decreasing species richness with elevation and mid elevation peaks. Patterns were robust to substantial amounts of error and did not appear to be a consequence of spatial constraints. Bat elevational richness patterns were related to local climatic gradients. Species richness was highest where both temperature and water availability were high and declined as temperature and water availability decreased. Mid elevational peaks occurred on mountains with dry arid bases and decreasing species richness occurred on mountains with wet warm bases. A preliminary analysis of bat richness patterns on elevational gradients in western Peru (dry base) and the Olympic Mountains WA (wet base) supported the predictions of the climate model. Main The relationship between species richness and combined temperature and water availability may be due to both direct (thermoregulatory constraints) and indirect (food resources) factors. Abundance was positively correlated with species richness suggesting that bat species richness may also be related to productivity. The climatic model may be applicable to other taxonomic groups with similar ecological constraints for instance certain bird insect and amphibian clades. 1145:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Body size often plays a significant role in community assembly through its impacts on the life history and ecological attributes of species. Insight into the importance of size in structuring communities can be gained by examining the distribution of sizes of individuals the individual size distribution (ISD) or size spectrum in a community. ISDs have been studied extensively in aquatic and tree communities but have received little attention in terrestrial animal communities. Here we conduct the first macroecological analysis of ISDs in terrestrial animal communities to determine whether they show broad scale consistency in shape. North America north of Mexico. Using likelihood based methods and Gaussian mixture modelling coupled with data from the Breeding Bird Survey and Christmas Bird Count we determine whether the ISDs for thousands of breeding and wintering North American bird communities are: (1) monotonically decreasing (2) unimodal or (3) multimodal. We find that avian ISDs are consistently multimodal with most characterized by more than five modes in both breeding and wintering communities from local to continental scales. In addition the positions of these modes along the size axis are remarkably consistent. The striking consistency in the ISD within bird communities as with tree and aquatic communities indicates that the ISD is an important and informative characterization of resource utilization within an ecological assemblage. The differences in shape of the ISD among these groups also suggest that differences in body size related constraints affect interactions within a group and with the environment. Our results confirm that avian assemblages do exhibit structure along the body size axis and therefore it will be fruitful to explore this pattern in greater detail. 1148:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Latitudinal and regional scale studies of reptile diversity suggest a predominant temperature effect unlike many other vertebrate richness patterns which tend to be highly correlated with both temperature and water variables. Here I examine montane gradients in reptile species richness with separate analyses of snakes and lizards from mountains around the world to assess a predominant temperature effect and three additional theories of diversity including a temperature water effect the species area effect and the mid domain effect (MDE). Twenty five elevational gradients of reptile diversity from temperate tropical and desert mountains in both hemispheres spanning 10.3 degrees N to 46.1 degrees N. Elevational gradients in reptile diversity are based on data from the literature. Of the 63 data sets found or compiled only those with a high unbiased sampling effort were used in analyses. Twelve predictions and three interactions of diversity theory were tested using nonparametric statistics linear regressions and multiple regression with the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Reptile richness and individually snake and lizard richness on mountains followed four distinct patterns: decreasing low elevation plateaus low elevation plateaus with mid elevation peaks and mid elevation peaks. Elevational reptile richness was most strongly correlated with temperature. The temperature effect was mediated by precipitation; reptile richness was more strongly tied to temperature on wet gradients than on arid gradients. Area was a secondary factor of importance whereas the MDE was not strongly associated with reptile diversity on mountains. Reptile diversity patterns on mountains did not follow the predicted temperature water effect as all diversity patterns were found on both wet and dry mountains. But the influence of precipitation on the temperature effect most likely reflects reptiles use of radiant heat sources (sunning opportunities) that are more widespread on arid mountains than wet mountains due to lower humidity sparser vegetation and less cloud cover across low and intermediate elevations. 114:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1150:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recently a flurry of studies have focused on the extent to which geographical patterns of diversity fit mid domain effect (MDE) null models. While some studies find strong support for MDE null models others find little. We test two hypotheses that might explain this variation among studies: small ranged groups of species are less likely than large ranged species to show mid domain peaks in species richness and mid domain null model predictions are less robust for smaller spatial extents than for larger spatial extents. We analyse data sets from elevational riverine continental and other domains from around the world. We use a combination of Spearman rank correlations and binomial tests to examine whether differences within and among studies and domains in the predictive power of MDE null models vary with spatial scale and range size. Small ranged groups of species are less likely to fit mid domain predictions than large ranged groups of species. At large spatial extents diversity patterns of taxonomic groups with large mean range sizes fit MDE null model predictions better than did diversity patterns of groups with small mean range sizes. MDE predictions were more explanatory at larger spatial extents than at smaller extents. Diversity patterns at smaller spatial extents fit MDE predictions poorly across all range sizes. Thus MDE predictions should be expected to explain patterns of species richness when ranges and the scale of analysis are both large. Taken together the support for these hypotheses offers a more sophisticated model of when MDE predictions should be expected to explain patterns of species richness namely when ranges and the scale of analysis are both large. Thus the circumstances in which the MDE is important are finite and apparently predictable. 1151:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The degree to which a species is predictably encountered within its range varies tremendously across species. Understanding why some species occur less frequently within their range than others has important consequences for conservation and for analyses of ecological patterns based on range maps. We examined whether patterns in geographical range occupancy can be explained by species level traits. North America. We used survey data from 1993 to 2002 from the North American Breeding Bird Survey along with digital range maps produced by NatureServe to calculate range occupancy for 298 species of terrestrial birds. We tested whether species traits explained variation in range occupancy values using linear regression techniques. We found three species traits that together explained more than half of the variation in range occupancy. Population density and niche breadth were positively correlated with occupancy while niche position was negatively correlated with occupancy. Our results suggest that high range occupancy will occur in species that are common at sites on which they occur that tolerate a relatively wide range of ecological conditions and that tend to have ranges centred on areas with common environmental conditions. Furthermore it appears that niche based characteristics may explain patterns of distribution and abundance from local habitats up to the scale of geographical ranges. 1157:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Discerning the processes influencing geographical patterns of species richness remains one of the central goals of modern ecology. Traditional approaches to exploring these patterns have focused on environmental and ecological correlates of observed species richness. Recently some have suggested these approaches suffer from the lack of an appropriate null model that accounts for species ranges being constrained to occur within a bounded domain. Proponents of these null geometric constraint models (GCMs) and the mid domain effect these models produce argue their utility in identifying meaningful gradients in species richness. This idea has generated substantial debate. Here we discuss what we believe are the three major challenges in the application of GCMs. First we argue that there are actually two equally valid null models for the random placement of species ranges within a domain one of which actually predicts a uniform distribution of species richness. Second we highlight the numerous decisions that must be made to implement a GCM that lead to marked differences in the predictions of the null model. Finally we discuss challenges in evaluating the importance of GCMs once they have been implemented. 1158:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Elevational gradients distributed across the globe are a powerful test system for understanding biodiversity. Here I use a comprehensive set of bird elevational gradients to test the main drivers of diversity including sampling area mid domain effect temperature temperature and water availability and hypotheses of evolutionary history. Seventy eight elevational gradients of bird diversity from mountains in both hemispheres spanning 24.5 degrees S to 48.2 degrees N including gradients from various climates biogeographical regions and habitat types. Data on bird elevational diversity were taken from the literature. Of the 150 datasets found or compiled only those with a high unbiased sampling effort were used in analyses. Datasets sampled all birds all breeding birds or all forest birds; a few studies detailed seasonal elevational shifts. Eighteen predictions of diversity theory were tested including three sets of interactions. Birds display four distinct diversity patterns in nearly equal frequency on mountains: decreasing diversity low elevation plateaus low elevation plateaus with mid peaks and unimodal mid elevational peaks. Bird elevational diversity strongly supports current climate as the main driver of diversity particularly combined trends in temperature and water availability. Bird diversity on humid mountains is either decreasing or shows a low elevation plateau in diversity while on dry mountains it is unimodal or a broad low elevation plateau usually with a mid elevation maximum. The predictions of sampling area and mid domain effect were not consistently supported globally. The only evolutionary hypothesis with preliminary support was niche conservatism. Both water and temperature variables are needed to comprehensively predict elevational diversity patterns for birds. This result is consistent for breeding and forest birds for both hemispheres and for local or regional scale montane gradients. More analyses are needed to discern whether the mechanism underlying these relationships is ecological based on direct physiological limitations or indirect food resource limitations or historical based on phylogenetic niche conservation or other evolutionary trends related to climate. The species area and mid domain effects are not supported as primary drivers of elevational diversity in birds. 1159:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Null models are pattern generating models that deliberately exclude a mechanism of interest and allow for randomization tests of ecological and biogeographic data. Although they have had a controversial history null models are widely used as statistical tools by ecologists and biogeographers. Three active research fronts in null model analysis include biodiversity measures species co occurrence patterns and macroecology. In the analysis of biodiversity ecologists have used random sampling procedures such as rarefaction to adjust for differences in abundance and sampling effort. In the analysis of species co occurrence and assembly rules null models have been used to detect the signature of species interactions. However controversy persists over the details of computer algorithms used for randomizing presence absence matrices. Finally in the newly emerging discipline of macroecology null models can be used to identify constraining boundaries in bivariate scatterplots of variables such as body size range size and population density. Null models provide specificity and flexibility in data analysis that is often not possible with conventional statistical tests. 1160:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Riddle and Hafner (1999) suggest that genetically differentiated lineages should be formally recognized as evolutionary significant units (ESUs) and that ESUs should replace currently recognized species as units in quantitative ecological and biogeographic analyses. Riddle and Hafner imply that if comparisons of desert rodent communities across many localities in south western North America by Brown and Kurzius (1987) and Kelt . (1996) had used ESUs rather than species substantially different results and conclusions would have been obtained. Here we defend our use of species in these studies and question the wisdom of formalizing the concept of ESU and applying it in most biogeographic ecological and behavioural studies. Studies of genetic variation and description of ESUs are uneven across taxa of mammals and geographical regions and those ESUs that have been described are often difficult or impossible to identify on the basis of the morphological traits used to distinguish currently recognized species. Consequently most of the specimens in museum drawers nearly all of the fossil remains and most of the animals studied in the field or laboratory by ecologists behaviourists and other biologists cannot be assigned to ESUs. The currently recognized species usually described originally on the basis of morphological and biological species concepts provide the only relatively consistent operational taxonomic units. Results of our studies on the biogeography of desert small mammals are not seriously altered by recent subdivisions of some species into multiple ESUs. 1161:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The four major papers in this special feature present and interpret data from field studies on the distributions and diversity of small mammals in elevational gradients on mountains in the Philippines. Borneo southern Mexico and western United States. In the introductory paper Lomolino places these studies in the context of historical methodological and conceptual themes in contemporary biogeography. In this final paper I focus on some important similarities and interesting differences among the four case studies. All of the studies provide evidence for the influence of ecological factors such as climate productivity and habitat heterogeneity on mammalian diversity. All also provide evidence for the influence of historical dispersal extinction and speciation events. Perhaps the most interesting result is the documentation of a frequent but not universal peak in species diversity at some elevation intermediate between the base and peak of a mountain. Efforts to understand the mechanistic basis for this pattern and why it differs from the continuous decrease in diversity from the equator to the poles promise to contribute to developing a general theoretical explanation for the major patterns of biodiversity on earth. 118:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper describes how climate variation in time and space can constrain community structure on a global scale. We explore body size scaling and the energetic consequences in terms of absorbed mass and energy and expended mass and energy. We explain how morphology specific physiological properties and temperature dependent behaviors are key variables that link individual energetics to population dynamics and community structure. This paper describes an integrated basic principles model for mammal energetics and extends the model to bird energetics. The model additions include molar balance models for the lungs and gut. The gut model couples food ingested to respiratory gas exchanges and evaporative water loss from the respiratory system. We incorporate a novel thermoregulatory model that yields metabolic calculations as a function of temperature. The calculations mimic empirical data without regression. We explore the differences in the quality of insulation between hair and feathers with our porous media model for insulation. For mammals ranging in size from mice to elephants we show that calculated metabolic costs are in agreement with experimental data We also demonstrate how we can do the same for birds ranging in size from hummingbirds to ostriches We show the impact of changing posture and changing air temperatures on energetic costs for birds and mammals We demonstrate how optimal body size that maximizes the potential for growth and reproduction changes with changing climatic conditions and with diet quality. Climate and diet may play important roles in constraining community structure (collection of functional types of different body sizes) at local and global scales Thus multiple functional types may coexist in a locality in part because of the temporal and spatial variation in climate and seasonal food variation. We illustrate how the models can be applied in a conservation and biodiversity context to a rare and endangered species of parrot the Orange bellied Parrot of Australia and Tasmania. 1198:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Geographic and ecological distributions of three Lutzomyia sand flies that are cutaneous leishmaniasis vectors in South America were analysed using ecological niche modelling. This new tool provides a large scale perspective on species geographic distributions ecological and historical factors determining them and their potential for change with expected environmental changes. As a first step the ability of this technique to predict geographic distributions of the three species was tested statistically using two subsampling techniques: a random selection technique that simulates 50 PeRcEnT data density and a quadrant based technique that challenges the method to predict into broad unsampled regions. Predictivity under both test schemes was highly statistically significant. Visualisation of ecological niches provided insights into the ecological basis for distributional differences among species. Projections of potential geographic distributions across scenarios of global climate change suggested that only Lutzomyia whitmani is likely to be experiencing dramatic improvements in conditions in south eastern Brazil where cutaneous leishmaniasis appears to be re emerging; Lutzomyia intermedia and Lutzomyia migonei may be seeing more subtle improvements in climatic conditions but the implications are not straightforward. More generally this technique offers the possibility of new views into the distributional ecology of disease vector and reservoir species. 1238:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Current weaknesses of diversity theory include: a failure to distinguish different biogeographical response variables under the general heading of diversity; and a general failure of ecological theory to deal adequately with geographical scale. Our aim is to articulate the case for a top down approach to theory building in which scale is addressed explicitly and in which different response variables are clearly distinguished. The article draws upon both theoretical contributions and empirical analyses from all latitudes focusing on terrestrial ecosystems and with some bias towards (woody) plants. We review current diversity theory and terminology in relation to scale of applicability. As a starting point in developing a general theory we take the issue of geographical gradients in species richness as a main theme and evaluate the extent to which commonly cited theories are likely to operate at scales from the macro down to the local. A degree of confusion surrounds the use of the terms alpha beta and gamma diversity and the terms local landscape and macro scale are preferred here as a more intuitive framework. The distinction between inventory and differentiation diversity is highlighted as important as in terms of scale of analysis are the concepts of focus and extent. The importance of holding area constant in analysis is stressed as is the notion that different environmental factors exhibit measurable heterogeneity at different scales. Evaluation of several of the most common diversity theories put forward for the grand dines in species richness indicates that they can be collapsed to dynamic hypotheses based on climate or historical explanations. The importance of the many ecological biological mechanisms that have been proposed is evident mainly at local scales of analysis whilst at the macro scale they are dependent largely upon climatic controls for their operation. Local communities have often been found not to be saturated to be non equilibrial. This is argued perhaps counter intuitively to be entirely compatible with the persistence through time of macro scale patterns of richness that are climatically determined. The review also incorporates recent developments in macroecology Rapoports rule trade offs and the importance of isolation landscape impedance and geometric constraints on richness (the mid domain effect) in generating richness patterns; highlighting those phenomena that are contributory to the first order climatic pattern and those such as the geometric constraints that may confound or obscure these patterns. A general theory of diversity must necessarily cover many disparate phenomena at various scales of analysis and cannot therefore be expressed in a simple formula but individual elements of this general theory may be. In particular it appears possible to capture in a dynamic climate based model and capacity rule the form of the grand dine in richness of woody plants at the macro stale. This provides a starting point for a top down global to local macro to micro scale approach to modelling richness variations in a variety of taxa. Patterns in differentiation endemicity on the other hand require more immediate attention to historical events and to features of geography such as isolation. Thus whilst we argue that there are basic physical principles and laws underlying certain diversity phenomena  macro scale richness gradients) a pluralistic body of theory is required that incorporates dynamic and historical explanation and which bridges equilibrial and nonequilibrial concepts and ideas. 1240:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Our aim in this paper is to present the first broad scale quantification of species abundance for rocky intertidal communities along the Pacific coast of North America. Here we examine the community level marine biogeographical patterns in the context of formerly described biogeographical regions and we evaluate the combined effects of geographical distance and environmental conditions on patterns of species similarity across this region. Pacific coast of North America. Data on the percentage cover of benthic marine organisms were collected at 67 rocky intertidal sites from south eastern Alaska USA to central Baja California Sur Mexico. Cluster analysis and non metric multidimensional scaling were used to evaluate the spatial patterns of species similarity among sites relative to those of previously defined biogeographical regions. Matrices of similarity in species composition among all sites were computed and analysed with respect to geographical distance and long term mean sea surface temperature (SST) as a measure of environmental conditions. We found a high degree of spatial structure in the similarity of intertidal communities along the coast. Cluster analysis identified 13 major community structure groups. Although breaks between clusters of sites generally occurred at major biogeographical boundaries some of the larger biogeographical regions contained several clusters of sites that did not group according to spatial position or identifiable coastal features. Additionally there were several outliers sites that grouped alone or with sites outside their region for which localized features may play an important role in driving community structure. Patterns of species similarity at the large scale were highly correlated with geographical distance among sites and with SST. Importantly we found community similarity to be highly correlated with long term mean SST while controlling for the effects of geographical distance. These findings reveal a high degree of spatial structure in the similarity of rocky intertidal communities of the north east Pacific and are generally consistent with those of previously described biogeographical regions with some notable differences. Breaks in similarity among clusters are generally coincident with known biogeographical and oceanographic discontinuities. The strong correlations between species similarity and both geographical position and SST suggest that both geography and oceanographic conditions have a large influence on patterns of intertidal community structure along the Pacific coast of North America. 1241:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The global species richness patterns of birds and mammals are strongly congruent. This could reflect similar evolutionary responses to the Earths history shared responses to current climatic conditions or both. We compare the geographical and phylogenetic structures of both richness gradients to evaluate these possibilities. Global. Gridded bird and mammal distribution databases were used to compare their species richness gradients with the current environment. Phylogenetic trees (resolved to family for birds and to species for mammals) were used to examine underlying phylogenetic structures. Our first prediction is that both groups have responded to the same climatic gradients. Our phylogenetic predictions include: (1) that both groups have similar geographical patterns of mean root distance a measure of the level of the evolutionary development of faunas and more directly (2) that richness patterns of basal and derived clades will differ with richness peaking in the tropics for basal clades and in the extra tropics for derived clades and that this difference will hold for both birds and mammals. We also explore whether alternative taxonomic treatments for mammals can generate patterns matching those of birds. Both richness gradients are associated with the same current environmental gradients. In contrast neither of our evolutionary predictions is met: the gradients have different phylogenetic structures and the richness of birds in the lowland tropics is dominated by many basal species from many basal groups whereas mammal richness is attributable to many species from both few basal groups and many derived groups. Phylogenetic incongruence is robust to taxonomic delineations for mammals. Contemporary climate can force multiple groups into similar diversity patterns even when evolutionary trajectories differ. Thus as widely appreciated our understanding of biodiversity must consider responses to both past and present climates and our results are consistent with predictions that future climate change will cause major correlated changes in patterns of diversity across multiple groups irrespective of their evolutionary histories. 1242:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To assess the extent to which the resolution at which geographical range sizes are measured influences macroecological patterns in this variable. Global. Data on the geographical ranges of parrot species were digitized and a Geographic Information System used to produce nine range size estimates for each species using different degrees of spatial resolution. The inter correlation of these estimates was then compared together with their patterns of covariation with population size body mass and migratory behaviour (across species and controlling for phylogeny) their pattern of phylogenetic correlation and the frequency distributions of the different measures. Strong correlations exist among all nine range size measures across species albeit that measures of similar spatial resolution are more strongly correlated. All measures show similar patterns of covariation with population size body mass and migratory behaviour and similar patterns of phylogenetic correlation. The skewness of frequency distributions increases towards zero as the resolution of the range size measure declines. The results of macroecological analyses are little affected by the resolution with which geographical range sizes are calculated at least for the parrots of the world. Previously published studies based on crude measures of range size would be unlikely to have produced markedly different conclusions had they used more refined range size metrics. 1243:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To demonstrate a new and more general model of the species area relationship that builds on traditional models but includes the provision that richness may vary independently of island area on relatively small islands (the small island effect). We analysed species area patterns for a broad diversity of insular biotas from aquatic and terrestrial archipelagoes. We used breakpoint or piecewise regression methods by adding an additional term (the breakpoint transformation) to traditional species area models. The resultant more general species area model has three readily interpretable biologically relevant parameters: (1) the upper limit of the small island effect (SIE) (2) an estimate of richness for relatively small islands and (3) the slope of the species area relationship (in semi log or log log space) for relatively large islands. The SIE albeit of varying magnitude depending on the biotas in question appeared to be a relatively common feature of the data sets we studied. The upper limit of the SIE tended to be highest for species groups with relatively high resource requirements and low dispersal abilities and for biotas of more isolated archipelagoes. The breakpoint species area model can be used to test for the significance and to explore patterns of variation in small island effects and to estimate slopes of the species area (semi log or log log) relationship after adjusting for SIE. Moreover the breakpoint species area model can be expanded to investigate three fundamentally different realms of the species area relationship: (1) small islands where species richness varies independent of area but with idiosyncratic differences among islands and with catastrophic events such as hurricanes (2) islands beyond the upper limit of SIE where richness varies in a more deterministic and predictable manner with island area and associated ecological factors and (3) islands large enough to provide the internal geographical isolation (large rivers mountains and other barriers within islands) necessary for in situ speciation. 1247:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To understand why and when areas of endemism (provinces) of the tropical Atlantic Ocean were formed how they relate to each other and what processes have contributed to faunal enrichment. Atlantic Ocean. The distributions of 2605 species of reef fishes were compiled for 25 areas of the Atlantic and southern Africa. Maximum parsimony and distance analyses were employed to investigate biogeographical relationships among those areas. A collection of 26 phylogenies of various Atlantic reef fish taxa was used to assess patterns of origin and diversification relative to evolutionary scenarios based on spatio temporal sequences of species splitting produced by geological and palaeoceanographic events. We present data on faunal (species and genera) richness endemism patterns diversity buildup  speciation processes) and evaluate the operation of the main biogeographical barriers and or filters. Phylogenetic (proportion of sister species) and distributional (number of shared species) patterns are generally concordant with recognized biogeographical provinces in the Atlantic. The highly uneven distribution of species in certain genera appears to be related to their origin with highest species richness in areas with the greatest phylogenetic depth. Diversity buildup in Atlantic reef fishes involved (1) diversification within each province (2) isolation as a result of biogeographical barriers and (3) stochastic accretion by means of dispersal between provinces. The timing of divergence events is not concordant among taxonomic groups. The three soft (non terrestrial) inter regional barriers (mid Atlantic Amazon and Benguela) clearly act as filters by restricting dispersal but at the same time allowing occasional crossings that apparently lead to the establishment of new populations and species. Fluctuations in the effectiveness of the filters combined with ecological differences among provinces apparently provide a mechanism for much of the recent diversification of reef fishes in the Atlantic. Our data set indicates that both historical events  Tethys closure) and relatively recent dispersal (with or without further speciation) have had a strong influence on Atlantic tropical marine biodiversity and have contributed to the biogeographical patterns we observe today; however examples of the latter process outnumber those of the former. 1248:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We reviewed the occurrence of Bergmanns rule in birds (ninety four species) and mammals (149 species) using only studies where statistical significance of the results was tested. We also tested whether studies using different characters as surrogates of body size have a different tendency to conform to Bergmanns rule whether body size and nest type (in birds) have an influence on the tendency to conform to the rule and whether sedentary birds conform to the rule more than migratory birds. Worldwide. We reviewed published data on geographic and temporal variation in body size using only studies where the statistical significance of the results was tested. We asked how many species conform to the rule out of all species studied in each order and family. Over 72 PeRcEnT of the birds and 65 PeRcEnT of the mammal species follow Bergmanns rule. An overall tendency to follow the rule occurs also within orders and families. Studies using body mass in mammals show the greatest tendency to adhere to Bergmanns rule (linear measurements and dental measurements show a weaker tendency); while in birds studies using body mass and other surrogates (linear measurements and egg size) show a similar tendency. Birds of different body mass categories exhibit a similar tendency to follow Bergmanns rule while in mammals the lower body size categories (4 50 and 50 500 g) show a significantly lower tendency to conform to the rule. Sedentary birds tend to conform to Bergmanns rule more than migratory species. Nest type does not affect the tendency to conform to Bergmanns rule. Bergmanns rule is a valid ecological generalization for birds and mammals. 1249:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Aims (i) To describe at the level of local communities latitudinal gradients in the species richness of different families of New World bats and to explore the generality of such gradients. (ii) To characterize the relative effects of changes in the richness of each family to the richness of entire communities. (iii) To determine differences in the rate and direction of latitudinal gradients in species richness within families. (iv) To evaluate how differences among families regarding latitudinal gradients in species richness influence the latitudinal gradient in species richness of entire communities. Continental New World ranging from the northern continental United States (Iowa 42 degrees N) to eastern Paraguay (Canindeyu 24 degrees S). Data on the species composition of communities came from 32 intensively sampled sites. Analyses focused on species richness of five of nine New World bat families. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis determined and described differences among temperate subtropical and tropical climatic zones regarding the species richness of bat families. Simple linear regression described latitudinal gradients in species richness of families. Path analysis was used to describe: (i) the direct effect of latitude on species richness of communities (ii) the indirect effects of latitude on the species richness of communities through its effect on the species richness of each family (iii) the relative effects of latitude on the species richness of bat families and (iv) the relative contribution of each family to variation in the species richness of communities. Highly significant differences among climatic zones existed primarily because of a difference between the temperate zone and the tropical and subtropical zones combined. This difference was associated with the high number of vespertilionids in the temperate zone and the high number of phyllostomids in the tropical and subtropical zones. Latitudinal gradients in species richness were contingent on phylogeny. Although only three of the five families exhibited significant gradients all families except for the Vespertilionidae exhibited indistinguishable increases in species richness with decreases in latitude. The Emballonuridae Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae exhibited significant latitudinal gradients whereby the former two families exhibited the classical increase in species richness with decreasing latitude and the latter family exhibited the opposite pattern. Variation in species richness of all families contributed significantly to variation in the species richness of entire communities. Nonetheless the Phyllostomidae made a significantly stronger contribution to changes in species richness of communities than did all other families. Much of the latitudinal gradient in species richness of communities could be accounted for by the effects of latitude on the species richness of constituent families. Ecological and evolutionary differences among higher taxonomic units particularly those differences involving life history traits predispose taxa to exhibit different patterns of diversity along environmental gradients. This may be particularly true along extensive gradients such as latitude. Nonetheless species rich taxa by virtue of their greater absolute rates of change can dominate and therefore define the pattern of diversity at a higher taxonomic level and eclipse differences among less represented taxa in their response to environmental gradients. This is true not only with respect to how bats drive the latitudinal gradient in species richness for all mammals but also for how the Phyllostomidae drives the latitudinal gradient for all bats in the New World. Better understanding of the mechanistic basis of latitudinal gradients of diversity may come from comparing and contrasting patterns across lower taxonomic levels of a higher taxon and by identifying key ecological and evolutionary traits that are associated with such differences. 1253:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We surveyed the empirical literature to determine how well six diversity hypotheses account for spatial patterns in species richness across varying scales of grain and extent. Worldwide. We identified 393 analyses (cases) in 297 publications meeting our criteria. These criteria included the requirement that more than one diversity hypothesis was tested for its relationship with species richness. We grouped variables representing the hypotheses into the following correlate types: climate productivity environmental heterogeneity edaphics nutrients area biotic interactions and dispersal history (colonization limitation or other historical or evolutionary effect). For each case we determined the primary variable: the one most strongly correlated with taxon richness. We defined primacy as the proportion of cases in which each correlate type was represented by the primary variable relative to the number of times it was studied. We tested for differences in both primacy and mean coefficient of determination of the primary variable between the hypotheses and between categories of five grouping variables: grain extent taxon (animal vs. plant) habitat medium (land vs. water) and insularity (insular vs. connected). Climate productivity had the highest overall primacy and environmental heterogeneity and dispersal history had the lowest. Primacy of climate productivity was much higher in large grain and large extent studies than at smaller scales. It was also higher on land than in water and much higher in connected systems than in insular ones. For other hypotheses differences were less pronounced. Throughout studies on plants and animals showed similar patterns. Coefficients of determination of the primary variables differed little between hypotheses and across the grouping variables the strongest effects being low means in the smallest grain class and for edaphics nutrients variables and a higher mean for water than for land in connected systems but vice versa in insular systems. We highlight areas of data deficiency. Our results support the notion that climate and productivity play an important role in determining species richness at large scales particularly for non insular terrestrial habitats. At smaller extents and grain sizes the primacy of the different types of correlates appears to differ little from null expectation. In our analysis dispersal history is rarely the best correlate of species richness but this may reflect the difficulty of incorporating historical factors into regression models and the collinearity between past and current climates. Our findings are consistent with the view that climate determines the capacity for species richness. However its influence is less evident at smaller spatial scales probably because (1) studies small in extent tend to sample little climatic range and (2) at large grains some other influences on richness tend to vary mainly within the sampling unit. 1279:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The presence of vagrants of the eastern Atlantic surgeonfish Acanthurus monroviae is confirmed for the south eastern coast of Brazil. Three other species Aulostomus strigosus (Aulostomidae) Parablennius pilicornis (Blenniidae) and Epinephelus marginatus (Serranidae) have apparently also crossed the Atlantic from east to west whereas the great majority of amphi Atlantic species appears to have their origin in the western Atlantic. 1280:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Trophic strategies and spatial use habits were investigated in reef fish communities. The results supported the hypothesis of differential use of food resources among tropical and higher latitude reef fishes the number of species and relative abundance of fishes relying on relatively low quality food significantly decreased from tropical to temperate latitudes. The species: genus ratio of low quality food consumers increased toward the tropics and was higher than the overall ratio considering all fishes in the assemblages. This supports the view that higher speciation rates occurred among this guild of fishes in warm waters. It was also demonstrated that density of herbivorous fishes (the dominant group relying on low quality food resources) in the western Atlantic decreased from tropical to temperate latitudes. Spatial use and mobility varied with latitude and consequently reef type and complexity. Fishes with small size home ranges predominated on tropical coral reefs. 1305:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Based on more than a year and a half of intensive fieldwork we document the community structure of bats at 2 sites (Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayu and Yaguarete Forests) in eastern Paraguay. Twenty nine species from 17 genera and 3 families were documented based on more than 7 000 captures. In general these communities share greatest affinities with either Atlantic rainforest or savanna grassland sites of South America. Significant differences exist between these communities in terms of structure based on rank abundance distributions and species composition. Moreover Yaguarete exhibits significantly more species than does Mbaracayu even after removing the effects of differences due to high flying insectivores. No significant differences existed between communities regarding other aspects of taxonomic diversity  evenness diversity or dominance of species) or any aspect of functional diversity. A higher degree of habitat heterogeneity at Yaguarete likely underlies these differences in community structure. 1306:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Body mass distributions of mammalian species are a major focus of macroecological and macroevolutionary studies. However these distributions may be obscured by taxonomic error just like any other aspect of biodiversity. The key problem with taxonomy is that many currently used names are synonyms of each other or are biologically indeterminate. This article reassesses body mass patterns in the fossil record of North American mammals using the recently developed flux ratio method for estimating the underlying proportion of invalid names. Current name quality varies very strongly with body mass: small species names are highly unreliable but names of large species have been evaluated thoroughly. The main reason is that there has been a dramatic fall through historical time in the average size of described species. Hence there simply has not been enough time yet to reevaluate the names of most small species. This bias only accentuates the previously described bimodal diversity distribution for North American mammals which suggests the existence of dual body mass optima so not all evolutionary lineages converge on 100 g. The historical shift in the underlying quality and body mass of newly described species also differentially affects our picture of biodiversity in major taxonomic groups. On the one hand ungulate and carnivoran names are much more likely to be invalid in the 1 st place than are rodent and insectivoran names. On the other hand most of the invalid names for large mammals already have been identified but this is not true for the small mammal groups. Therefore the most fruitful strategy for future taxonomic research would be to focus on small and medium sized mammals. 1307:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Given the uneven and biased nature of present understanding of geographic distributions of mammal species tools for extrapolating from what is known to a more general prediction would be most useful. We used the genetic algorithm for rule set prediction (GARP) to generate ecological niche models that were then projected onto geography to predict potential geographic distributions for 17 mammal species of Insectivora Chiroptera Rodentia and Artiodactyla in Oaxaca Mexico. GARP depends on point occurrence localities from museum records of species along with electronic maps describing features of climate topography and vegetation type. Point localities were divided in 2 sets: one of localities from museum records dated before 1960 which was used to generate the predicted distributions and the other of localities of museum records resulting from recent inventories (post 1960) which was used to test model accuracy. Predicted distributions for 11 of 17 species were statistically significantly more coincident with independent test points than random expectations; tests for the remaining 6 species would have required larger numbers of test localities to establish significance. GARP is a robust tool for modeling species geographic distributions with excellent potential for applicability to strategies for conservation of mammals in Oaxaca and elsewhere. 1309:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Little is known about geographic variation in the local composition of South American assemblages of mammals or the factors that may produce such variation. This is particularly unfortunate in Paraguay because it occurs at the interface of a number of phytogeographic regions  Cerrado Chaco Interior Atlantic Rainforest and Pantanal) and is the point at which many temperate species reach their northern limits or at which tropical species reach their southern limits. Based on 2 years of intensive fieldwork we documented the species and familial composition of bat assemblages at 25 sites throughout the country. We also estimated similarity among sites based on indices sensitive to presence or absence of species (Ochiais index) to rank abundance of species (rank correlation index) or to relative abundance of species (Euclidean index). Geographic distance between sites accounted for little variation in composition based on presence absence or rank abundances of species but accounted significantly for variation related to both identity and relative frequency of species. Distinct assemblages of species do not correspond to the 7 distinct biomes of the country; rather strong differences exist between sites east (mesic) and west (xeric) of the Rio Paraguay. For the most part these differences are related to dominance by molossids  Eumops patagonicus Molossops temminckii and Molossus molossus) and vespertilionids  Lasiurus ega Myotis albescens and M. nigricans) in dry regions versus phyllostomids  Artibeus fimbriatus A. lituratus and Sturnira lilium) in mesic regions. As a consequence classification of sites into 2 broad biogeographic regions based on bat familial composition generally is concordant with that based on plants. 1310:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Qualitative and quantitative variation in morphology was assessed for 6 species of Myotis from South America to determine which taxa occur in Paraguay characteristics that allow for their discrimination and the degree of geographic and secondary sexual variation that occurs in Paraguayan forms. Secondary sexual dimorphism and geographic variation were evaluated from univariate and multivariate perspectives. Multivariate morphometric differences in cranial morphology among taxa independent of size and mensural characters that best separate species were determined using principal components analysis followed by size adjusted discriminant function analysis. Five species M. albescens M. nigricans M. riparius M. ruber and M. simus occur in Paraguay and can be distinguished using combinations of cranial and external characteristics. No significant sexual dimorphism or geographic variation was detected in these taxa of Myotis in Paraguay. M. levis has not been recorded for Paraguay as previously reported but it may occur in the country. M. simus a species previously considered to be restricted to the Amazon Basin occurs as far south as Paraguay and northern Argentina. Although M. simus varies significantly in size across its range highly differentiated cranial and external morphology allows for recognition of this species across its range. 1335:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding spatial patterns of species diversity and the distributions of individ ual species is a consuming problem in biogeography and conservation. The Cape floristic region of South Africa is a global hot spot of diversity and endemism and the Protea atlas project with about 60 000 site records across the region provides an extraordinarily rich data set to model patterns of biodiversity. Model development is focused spatially at the scale of 1() grid cells (about 37 000 cells total for the region). We report on results for 23 species of a flowering plant family known as Proteaceae (of about 330 in the Cape floristic region) for a defined subregion. Using a Bayesian framework we developed a two stage spatially explicit hierarchical logistic regression. Stage 1 models the potential probability of presence or absence for each species at each cell given species attributes grid cell (site level) environmental data with species level coefficients and a spatial random effect. The second level of the hierarchy models the probability of observing each species in each cell given that it is present. Because the atlas data are not evenly distributed across the landscape grid cells contain variable numbers of sampling localities. Thus this model takes the sampling intensity at each site into account by assuming that the total number of times that a particular species was observed within a site follows a binomial distribution. After assigning prior distributions to all quantities in the model samples from the posterior distribution were obtained via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Results are mapped as the model estimated probability of presence for each species across the domain. This provides an alternative to customary empirical range of occupancy displays. Summing yields the predicted richness of species over the region. Summaries of the posterior for each environmental coefficient show which variables are most important in explaining the presence of species. Our initial results describe biogeographical patterns over the modelled region remarkably well. In particular species local population size and mode of dispersal contribute significantly to predicting patterns along with annual precipitation the coefficient of variation in rainfall and elevation. 1387:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present new data and the first rigorous analysis of latitudinal and thermal gradients of diversity density and biomass of marine herbivorous fishes and review proposed explanatory mechanisms. Consistently negative relationships between latitude and positive relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and relative richness and relative abundance of herbivorous fishes were found worldwide. Significant differences in the strength of gradients of richness and abundance with latitude and SST between tropical and extratropical zones were found consistently across ocean basins. Standardized sampling along the western Atlantic also showed negative relationships between latitude and total density and biomass. The trends however are driven by different components of the fish assemblages  scarids in the Caribbean and acanthurids in Brazil). Patterns of abundance along thermal gradients generally associated with extensive latitudinal gradients also were found at the local scale. Feeding rate of the ocean surgeonfish Acanthurus bahianus decreases with temperature more rapidly than the mean metabolic rate of teleost fishes. This relationship suggests a temperature related physiological constraint. From the new standardized and comparative data presented and the review of the explanatory hypotheses we conclude that temperature related feeding and digestive processes are most likely involved in the distribution patterns of herbivorous fishes. 1423:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The carnivore community of the altiplano ecosystem of the high Andes including the Andean mountain cat (Leopardus jacobita) and pampas cat (Leopardus colocolo) is one of the least studied in the world. We determined the origin of 186 carnivore samples (184 faeces and two skulls) collected above 3000 m above sea level in northern Chile including 33 from the Andean mountain cat and 75 from the pampas cat using diagnostic molecular genetic sequence variation. We determined for the first time food habits habitat and physiographic associations and general patterns of molecular genetic variation of the Andean mountain cat and the pampas cat in Chile. Both species had narrow dietary niches dominated by small rodents and there was a wide overlap in diet composition (0.82) suggesting low levels of prey partitioning between species. The mountain viscacha (Lagidium viscacia) made up a large proportion of the biomass of the diet of both species especially for the Andean mountain cat (93.9 PeRcEnT vs. 74.8 PeRcEnT for the pampas cat) underscoring the importance of further research and conservation focus on this vanishing prey species. Although the probability of finding Andean mountain cat scats increased with altitude and slope there was substantial geographical overlap in distribution between species revealing that the pampas cat distribution includes high altitude grassland habitats. The Andean mountain cat had relatively low levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic variation (two mtDNA haplotypes) compared with the pampas cat (17 mtDNA haplotypes) suggestive of a distinct evolutionary history and relatively smaller historic populations. These insights will facilitate and provide tools and hypotheses for much needed research and conservation efforts on these species and this ecosystem. 1445:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We reconsider our estimates of climate related extinction in the light of three questions raised by Thuiller . Buckley and Roughgarden and Harte . We are able to confirm our original conclusion that climate change represents a major threat to terrestrial species. First how much do estimates of extinction depend on the specific approach used to model current and future species distributions? From Table 1 in Thuiller . we calculate that distribution model choice produces 1.33 fold variation on average in projected extinction in pairwise comparisons of methods. This is important but smaller than both the twofold variation due to contrasting dispersal assumptions and the twofold variation due to the different climate change scenarios that we reported1. The number of environmental variables used during modelling could also affect conclusions but we found no correlation between these and our estimates of extinction risk in global samples (r 240.001; not significant; each study: 1 d.f.). Results consistent with our original estimates can be derived from simple population projections without the need for formal distribution models.An index of total population sizes for 12 endemic bird species in Queensland Australia has been derived by measuring population density in elevation bands and multiplying by the habitat area in each band. Population change was projected directly using the relationship between elevation and temperature (Australian Meteorological Bureau data). The resulting rate of decline in population size was very similar to the rate of decline in distribution area projected using BIOCLIM which is a distribution modelling method we used to project extinctions. Overall estimates of area loss and extinction risk do not seem to be particularly sensitive to model details when averaging over many species as we did. By contrast the details can be critical when considering the prognosis for an individual species (for example when explaining why some species survive in small areas but others die out).We fully agree that the relative merits of different approaches need further assessment. Second can modified species area relationship methods (SAR) be used to translate average range area losses into estimates of extinction? We do not accept Buckley and Roughgardens assertion that our analysis is circular. As they note summed area ( A) is correlated with the number of species: A4SR where S is the number of species and R is the mean range area of species either before (Roriginal) or after (Rnew) some environmental change. We can substitute SRnew and SRoriginal in place of Anew and Aoriginal in our original method such that S cancels out (species with new range sizes of zero are included) and the number of species does not enter into the calculation (for E the proportion of species projected to become extinct E411 Rnew Roriginal z). Only mean range change per species matters. As 50 PeRcEnT destruction of a given habitat generates a mean of 50 PeRcEnT decline in range area per species mean area loss per original species (the method that we use) and habitat area loss (as in traditional SAR applications to habitat destruction) on average return the same estimate of expected extinction. None of our three methods is affected by this criticism. Because mean values are used there is no double countingof range areas. For one vegetation type (the Fynbos floral kingdom in South Africa) we can compare a traditional habitat based SAR estimate of extinction risk with estimates based on our species averaging methods. Proteaceaecontaining Fynbos vegetation should decline in area by 65 PeRcEnT with climate change (climate scenario HadCM2n4Gga IS92a for 2050). The resultant estimate of extinction is 23 PeRcEnT (traditional SAR z40.25) which is close to our corresponding estimate of 24 PeRcEnT of Proteaceae species at risk (mean of three SAR methods z40.25 full dispersal modelled using the same climate scenario and environmental variables). This full dispersal comparison is appropriate because traditional SAR applies to habitat area and does not consider additional extinctions caused by range dislocations when a habitat moves as well as contracts. A third of Fynbos Proteaceae have been predicted to show no overlap between current and future ranges in line with our estimate of 34 PeRcEnT extinction (no dispersal mean of SAR estimates). Our general conclusions do not even rely on using SAR methods.Harte . suggest estimating how many species will lose all of their range area. We projected that 5 PeRcEnT 8 PeRcEnT and 16 PeRcEnT (mean of dispersal scenarios) of the species considered would have lost 100 PeRcEnT of their climatically suitable area by 2050 for minimum mid range and maximum climate warming respectively. Some 15 PeRcEnT 22 PeRcEnT and 40 PeRcEnT (mean of dispersal scenarios) of species are projected to have lost more than 90 PeRcEnT of their climatically suitable areas by 2050 for minimum mid range and maximum warming respectively. A comparable increase in temperature is expected between 2050 and 2100 as between now and 2050 so distribution changes will continue unabated after 2050. We previously assigned species losing 90 PeRcEnT of their climatically suitable area by 2050 a 44 PeRcEnT chance of eventual extinction using the method that provided the highest estimate of extinction. This was modest considering that most species projected to lose 90 PeRcEnT of their suitable range by 2050 will subsequently lose the remainder as a result of continuing climate change. Third how will local adaptations affect the ability of species to respond to climate change and why will species not be able to evolve adaptations to new conditions rather than become extinct? Harte . are correct in their assertion that distribution models implicitly assume that locally adapted regional populations are capable of evolving up to but not beyond the set of conditions inhabited by the species as a whole and they may not always achieve this. Evolving to exploit conditions outside those currently used by the entire species may be difficult because asymmetric gene flow from distribution cores to margins and or lack of appropriate variation in marginal populations can prevent the establishment of adaptations that would allow them to colonize ever more extreme environments. Why otherwise are range sizes for most taxa very small? In practice the Quaternary record shows that species have typically responded to past climate changes by shifting range rather than by evolving in situ. Evolutionary responses provide additional uncertainty. If Harte . are correct about limitations imposed by ecotypic variation our estimates of extinction risk will be conservative. Although further investigation is needed into each of these areas it is unlikely to result in substantially reduced estimates of extinction. Anthropogenic climate change seems set to generate very large numbers of species level extinctions.  1492:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One challenge in modeling human movement is understanding recurrent patterns of space use that are not well captured by the random walk models applied so successfully to diffusing particles. In an elegant paper Chaoming Song . showed that human mobility patterns exhibit unusual scaling laws that may be explained by a combination of random exploration and preferential return to previously visited locations. Such recurrent movement is however by no means unique to humans. The patterns that Song at al. find are in fact strongly reminiscent of what wildlife ecologists refer to as home range behaviour. This observation led us to repeat several of the analyses of Song . using radiotelemetry data from four capuchin monkeys foraging for fruit in the tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island Panama. Monkey mobility patterns were strikingly similar to those of urban cell phone users both in microscopic properties (distributions of displacement length and waiting time) and in macroscopic properties (ultraslow growth of mean squared displacement power law growth of the number of distinct sites visited and a power law distribution for the number of visits per site). The power law exponents for waiting time and rate of increase in the number of sites visited were virtually indistinguishable from those reported by Song . for humans. The consistency in behaviour among monkeys in our sample and between monkeys and humans suggests that the cognitive mechanisms that control human movement are not uniquely human but have deep phylogenetic roots that transcend superficial differences in habitat and behaviour. This should stand as a warning to students of human mobility to avoid the human exceptionalism so ingrained in comparative psychology where bold claims of human uniqueness in tool use language spatial memory and myriad other capacities have not survived careful scrutiny. It also implies that the expansive literature on animal home range behaviour is likely to hold important insights for understanding human mobility. Marrying this ecological knowledge with scaling theories from physics holds great promise for further advances in the modeling of human movement.  1493:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We review the biogeography of microorganisms in light of the biogeography of macroorganisms. A large body of research supports the idea that free living microbial taxa exhibit biogeographic patterns. Current evidence confirms that as proposed by the Baas Becking hypothesis the environment selects and is in part responsible for spatial variation in microbial diversity. However recent studies also dispute the idea that everything is everywhere. We also consider how the processes that generate and maintain biogeographic patterns in macroorganisms could operate in the microbial world. 1506:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Dispersal can limit the ranges of species and the diversity of communities. Despite its importance little is known about its role in freshwater habitats and its relation to habitat type (lentic vs. lotic) especially for organisms with cryptic dispersal methods such as plankton. Poor dispersers are expected to show more clumped distributions or greater spatial autocorrelation (SA) in community composition than good dispersers. We examined patterns of SA across freshwater taxa with different dispersal modes (active vs. passive) and their association with habitat type (lake vs. stream) using 18 spatially explicit community composition data sets. We found significant relationships between SA and body size among taxa in lake habitats but not in streams. However the increase in SA with body size in lakes was driven entirely by fishes organisms ranging in size from diatoms to macro invertebrates showed equivalent levels of SA. These results support the idea that large organisms are less effective dispersers in aquatic environments resulting in greater SA in community structure over broad scales. Streams may be effectively more connected than lakes as patterns of SA and body size were weaker in lotic habitats. Our data suggest that the critical threshold where greater body size increases dispersal limitation seems to come at the juncture between invertebrates and vertebrates rather than that between unicellular and multicellular organisms as has been previously suggested. 1514:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, sites undergoing environmental change we examined three data sets on long term trends in taxonomic richness and composition: (1) 22 years of rodent censuses from a site in the Chihuahuan Desert of Arizona; (2) 50 years of bird surveys from a three county region of northern Michigan; and (3) approximately 10 000 years of pollen records from two sites in Europe. In all three cases richness has remained remarkably constant despite large changes in composition. The results suggest that while species composition may be highly variable and change substantially in response to environmental change species diversity is an emergent property of ecosystems that is often maintained within narrow limits. Such regulation of diversity requires maintenance of relatively constant levels of productivity and resource availability and an open system with opportunity for compensatory colonizations and extinctions. In addition to studying the effects of diversity on biogeochemical processes it will often be useful to think of species richness as an emergent consequence of ecosystem processes. 1519:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We welcome the opportunity to respond to O Connor . We hope that this exchange will help to clarify some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and will point towards fruitful areas for future research. The MTE has been formulated based on the premise that the structure and dynamics of ecological communities are inextricably linked to individual metabolism. The individual metabolic rate is the rate at which an organism takes up energetic and material resources from the environment transforms them into useable forms and allocates them to the fitness enhancing processes of survival growth and reproduction. Interactions between organisms and their environment (including other organisms) are therefore constrained by metabolic rate. Physiologists have long known that there are three primary factors that control metabolic rate: body size body temperature and resource availability. MTE builds on this earlier work by providing a quantitative framework to better understand how these three variables combine to affect metabolic rate and how metabolic rate in turn influences the ecology and evolution of populations communities and ecosystems. Gillooly . developed a model for the scaling of metabolic rate that combines the effects of body size and temperature. The model leads to a single equation for individual metabolic rate: B equals boM3 4e E kT (1) where bo is a normalization constant M is body mass and T is absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin. The size dependence M3 4 is attributed to geometric constraints on the delivery of energy and materials to cells through biological distribution networks. The Boltzmann Arrhenius term e E kT; characterizes the exponential effect of temperature where E is the average activation energy of the respiratory complex (0.65 eV) and k is Boltzmanns constant (8.62x10 5 eV K 1). This simple analytical expression yields quantitative predictions on metabolic rate that are supported by empirical data for a broad assortment of taxonomic groups. 1523:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although latitudinal gradients in species richness are well documented for a plethora of taxa in terrestrial freshwater and marine environments little consensus exists concerning the predominant biological factor that is responsible for the pattern. We produced an analytical null model to assess the degree to which gradients in species richness could be a consequence of the random determination of the limits of species ranges. The model predicts a parabolic increase in species richness toward the middle of a latitudinal domain in the absence of underlying environmental gradients. Our stochastic model accounted for a significant portion of variation in marsupial and bat species richness for each of three different latitudinal domains in the New World: continental limits the latitudinal extent of each higher taxon and the smallest latitudinal extent which comprises 95 PeRcEnT of the species in the higher taxon. A unique prediction of the stochastic model which distinguishes it from all other hypotheses is that parabolic latitudinal gradients in richness should exist for species wholly contained within random latitudinal subsets. Observed gradients for New World marsupials and bats document that this is true. Regardless of taxon or domain differences between observed and expected species richness (residuals) were not related appreciably to latitudinal band area (r(2)   0.15). The ubiquity and similarity of latitudinal gradients in species richness for different taxa could be a consequence of pervasive stochastic mechanisms rather than a product of a dominant underlying environmental gradient to which all species respond. Application of our null model to other gradients  depth productivity disturbance) may provide insight into mechanisms affecting patterns of species richness in other ecological or biogeographic settings. 1525:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although the examination of latitudinal gradients of species richness is common little attention has been devoted to other components of biodiversity such as phenetic diversity. Because the phenotype reflects aspects of an organisms environment ecological relationships and evolutionary history measures of phenetic diversity likely provide complimentary information to that of species richness and may provide unique insights for understanding the mechanistic basis to patterns of biodiversity. Herein we evaluate latitudinal gradients in the phenetic diversity of 32 New World bat communities. Seven morphological characters were used to estimate phenotypic variation among bat species within local communities. Principal components analysis decomposed this variation into axes of size and shape. Three measures of phenetic diversity were calculated separately for size and for shape axes. The range of species scores on a particular axis described the amount of phenetic variation encompassed by species in a community. The standard deviation of minimum spanning tree segment lengths described uniformity of species. Average nearest neighbor distances described local packing. We separately regressed these six measures on local species richness and latitude separately. Variation in species richness accounted for a significant amount of variation in each measure of phenetic diversity. Latitude also accounted for significant variation in phenetic diversity except for the standard deviation of minimum spanning tree segment lengths and the average nearest neighbor distance on the shape axis. More importantly gradients in phenetic diversity were significantly different than would be expected as a consequence of latitudinal gradients in species richness. Nonetheless when variation among communities regarding the richness and composition of their regional faunas was taken into consideration differences between empirical and simulated gradients were nonsignificant. Thus factors that determine the composition of regional faunas have a great impact on the phenetic diversity of communities and ultimately the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity. 1528:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biologists have long been fascinated by species borders and with good reason. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species borders may prove to be the key that unlocks new understanding across a wide range of biological phenomena. After all geographic range limits are a point of entry into understanding the ecological niche and threshold responses to environmental change. Elucidating patterns of gene flow to and returning from peripheral populations can provide important insights into the nature of adaptation speciation and coevolution. Species borders form natural laboratories for the study of the spatial structure of species interactions. Comparative studies from the center to the margin of species ranges allow us to explore species demographic responses along gradients of increasing environmental stress. Range dynamics further permit investigation into invasion dynamics and represent bellwethers for a changing climate. This set of papers explores ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species borders from diverse empirical and theoretical perspectives. 152:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The latitudinal gradient of decreasing richness from tropical to extratropical areas is ecologys longest recognized pattern. Nonetheless notable exceptions to the general pattern exist and it is well recognized that patterns may be dependent on characteristics of spatial scale and taxonomic hierarchy. We conducted an extensive survey of the literature and provide a synthetic assessment of the degree to which variation in patterns (positive linear negative linear modal or nonsignificant) is a consequence of characteristics of scale (extent or focus) or taxon. In addition we considered latitudinal gradients with respect to generic and familial richness as well as species evenness and diversity. We provide a classification of the over 30 hypotheses advanced to account for the latitudinal gradient and we discuss seven hypotheses with most promise for advancing ecological biogeographic and evolutionary understanding. We conclude with a forward looking synthesis and list of fertile areas for future research. 1543:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this paper we will outline several empirical approaches to developing and testing hypotheses about the determinants of species borders. We highlight environmental change as an important opportunity arguing that these unplanned large scale manipulations can be used to study mechanisms which limit species distributions. Our discussion will emphasize three main ideas. First we review the traditional biogeographic approach. We show how modern analytical and computer techniques have improved this approach and generated important new hypotheses concerning species range determinants. However abilities to test those hypotheses continue to be limited. Next we look at how the additions of temporal data field and lab experimentation biological details and replication when applied to systems that have been the subject of classical biogeographic studies have been used to support or refute hypotheses on range determinants. Such a multi faceted approach adds rigor consistency and plausible mechanisms to the study of species ranges and has been especially fruitful in the study of climate and species ranges. Lastly we present an alternative avenue for exploration of range limiting mechanisms which has been under utilized. We argue that carefully designed comparisons and contrasts between groups of species or systems provide a powerful tool for examining hypotheses on species borders. The seasonality hypothesis as an explanation for Rapoports rule serves as a model of this approach. A test is constructed by comparing patterns of seasonality and range size among marine and terrestrial systems. The seasonality hypothesis is not supported. 1553:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent studies show that ecological interaction networks depart from the   scale free   topologies observed in many other real world networks. Such a departure has been hypothesized to result from non matching biological attributes of species such as phenology or morphology that prevent the occurrence of certain interactions (  forbidden links  ). Here I compare the topology of 17 plant animal mutualistic networks with that predicted by a simple null model that assumes that a species degree (number of interspecific interactions) is a function of its frequency of interaction. The topology predicted by this null model is strikingly close to that observed in the real networks. Thus this null model provides a simple alternative interpretation of patterns observed in ecological interaction networks that does not require the existence of non matching species traits. 156:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The use of molecular techniques to assess prokaryotic diversity independent of the need for enrichment culture has profoundly changed how we view and study microbial diversity. As molecular data have accumulated over the past 15 years these data are now resulting in a healthy debate about how much we really know about prokaryotic diversity in a wide range of environments (8 21 23 32 44 55). A number of recent articles have discussed these questions and opinions range from the position that prokaryotic diversity is essentially infinite with the existence of millions of potential species (6 10) to arguments that microbial diversity is reasonably finite (17 26). In light of this debate concerning the results of theoretical considerations and molecule based surveys it is interesting to take stock of the holdings of the environmental prokaryotes available at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) to determine how these holdings reflect overall trends in microbial diversity in different habitats. The principle mission of bioresource centers such as the ATCC is to serve as living stock collections that acquire diverse biological materials for redistribution to researchers throughout the world. The ATCC has about two thirds of the type strains of prokaryotic species in the world. In many cases multiple strains of a given species are acquired. As these materials are accessioned data relevant to their provenance and physiology are collected. These data are an underutilized asset of bioresource centers. For example the data on the source locations of isolates can provide information about the relative sampling efforts for different geographic regions. Concordantly data concerning the environmental habitats of isolates can provide important information about the diversity of genera that are associated with certain habitat types. No articles were found in a literature search that specifically analyzed culture collections as a metric for assessing our knowledge of larger patterns of microbial diversity. In this article we present an analysis of the holdings of environmental prokaryotes at the ATCC with regard to the geographical and environmental habitats from which they were isolated. The term environmental is broadly defined to include all organisms that are not pathogenic to humans or animals or that are not otherwise human associated (see below). Selected habitats for which holdings at the ATCC are the most abundant were compared to recently published findings of workers who used cultivation in dependent methods to assess microbial diversity. This provided perspective on how well the   captured diversity   in a culture collection represents the diversity which may exist in nature. 1645:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quaternary glacial interglacial cycles repeatedly forced thermal zones up and down the slopes of mountains at all latitudes. Although no one doubts that these temperature cycles have left their signature on contemporary patterns of geography and phylogeny the relative roles of ecology and evolution are not well understood especially for the tropics. To explore key mechanisms and their interactions in the context of chance events we constructed a geographical range based stochastic simulation model that incorporates speciation anagenetic evolution niche conservatism range shifts and extinctions under late Quaternary temperature cycles along tropical elevational gradients. In the model elevational patterns of species richness arise from the differential survival of founder lineages consolidated by speciation and the inheritance of thermal niche characteristics. The model yields a surprisingly rich variety of realistic patterns of phylogeny and biogeography including close matches to a variety of contemporary elevational richness profiles from an elevational transect in Costa Rica. Mountaintop extinctions during interglacials and lowland extinctions at glacial maxima favour mid elevation lineages especially under the constraints of niche conservatism. Asymmetry in temperature (greater duration of glacial than of interglacial episodes) and in lateral area (greater land area at low than at high elevations) have opposing effects on lowland extinctions and the elevational pattern of species richness in the model and perhaps in nature as well. 1653:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We consider statistical patterns of variation in growth rates for over 400 species of breeding birds across North America surveyed from 1966 to 1998. We report two results. First the standard deviation of population growth rates decays as a power law function of total population size with an exponent beta equals 0.36 0.02. Second the number of subpopulations measured as the number of survey locations with non zero counts scales to the 3 4 power of total number of birds counted in a given species. We show how these patterns may be related and discuss a simple stochastic growth model for a geographically subdivided population that formalizes the relationship. We also examine reasons that may explain why some species deviate from these scaling laws. 1671:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Identifying the factors underlying the origin and maintenance of the latitudinal diversity gradient is a central problem in ecology but no consensus has emerged on which processes might generate this broad pattern. Interestingly the vast majority of studies exploring the gradient have focused on free living organisms ignoring parasitic and infectious disease (PID) species. Here we address the influence of environmental factors on the biological diversity of human pathogens and their global spatial organization. Using generalized linear multivariate models and Monte Carlo simulations we conducted a series of comparative analyses to test the hypothesis that human PIDs exhibit the same global patterns of distribution as other taxonomic groups. We found a significant negative relationship between latitude and PID species richness and a nested spatial organization the accumulation of PID species with latitude over large spatial scales. Additionally our results show that climatic factors are of primary importance in explaining the link between latitude and the spatial pattern of human pathogens. Based on our findings we propose that the global latitudinal species diversity gradient might be generated in large part by biotic interactions providing strong support for the idea that current estimates of species diversity are substantially underestimated. When parasites and pathogens are included estimates of total species diversity may increase by more than an order of magnitude. 1672:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Perhaps the greatest mystery surrounding dinosaurs concerns whether they were endotherms ectotherms or some unique intermediate form. Here we present a model that yields estimates of dinosaur body temperature based on ontogenetic growth trajectories obtained from fossil bones. The model predicts that dinosaur body temperatures increased with body mass from approximately 25 degrees C at 12 kg to approximately 41 degrees C at 13 000 kg. The model also successfully predicts observed increases in body temperature with body mass for extant crocodiles. These results provide direct evidence that dinosaurs were reptiles that exhibited inertial homeothermy. 1716:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Morphometric variation with respect to 15 mensural characters was assessed for adult specimens from 13 populations of Ambrysus mormon Montandon in the United States. This provides a context from which to assess the degree of divergence of an isolated population (Ash Warm Springs Nevada) which possesses discrete state characteristics that differ markedly from those of other populations of the species. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that interpopulational differences were dependent on sex a finding corroborated by the univariate perspective provided by Bonferronis sequential adjustment that additionally identified lengths of body protibia and protarsus as contributing to the interaction between population and sex. Moreover all pairwise comparisons of the 13 populations were significant for males as well as for females (F tests from discriminant function analysis). Indeed the pattern of morphometric variation among populations was similar in males and females but was not a consequence of differentiation by geographic distance (Mantel analyses). Interindividual variation primarily was due to differences in size as the first axis from principal components analysis accounted for 92.2 PeRcEnT of the total variation. Three additional axes represented shape and each accounted for at least 10 PeRcEnT for the remaining variation among individuals. The population from Ash Warm Springs differed markedly (larger protarsus relative to meso and metatarsi and smaller pro meso and metatarsi relative to body length and synthlipsis) from the other populations suggesting the need for systematic revision of its subspecific affiliation. In contrast populations of A. m. heidemanni Montandon and A. m minor La Rivers were similar to the other populations of the nominate subspecies suggesting their subspecific recognition is questionable. The distinctiveness of the population from Ash Warm Springs as an isolated remnant of the historically connected pluvial White River intimates that it may be a taxon in the process of specific differentiation. 171:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1732:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, For two centuries biologists have documented a gradient of animal and plant biodiversity from the tropics to the poles but have been unable to agree whether it is controlled primarily by productivity temperature or historical factors. Recent reports that find latitudinal diversity gradients to be reduced or absent in some unicellular organisms and attribute this to their high abundance and dispersal capabilities would suggest that bacteria the smallest and most abundant organisms should exhibit no latitudinal pattern of diversity. We used amplified ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) whole assemblage genetic fingerprinting to quantify species richness in 103 near surface samples of marine bacterial plankton taken from tropical to polar in both hemispheres. We found a significant latitudinal gradient in richness. The data can help to evaluate hypotheses about the cause of the gradient. The correlations of richness with latitude and temperature were similarly strong whereas correlations with parameters relating to productivity (chlorophyll annual primary productivity bacterial abundance) and other variables (salinity and distance to shore) were much weaker. Despite the high abundance and potentially high dispersal of bacteria they exhibit geographic patterns of species diversity that are similar to those seen in other organisms. The latitudinal gradient in marine bacteria supports the hypothesis that the kinetics of metabolism setting the pace for life has strong influence on diversity. 1739:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In the most extensive analysis of body size in marine invertebrates to date we show that the size frequency distributions of northeastern Pacific bivalves at the provincial level are surprisingly invariant in modal and median size as well as size range despite a 4 fold change in species richness from the tropics to the Arctic. The modal sizes and shapes of these size frequency distributions are consistent with the predictions of an energetic model previously applied to terrestrial mammals and birds. However analyses of the Miocene Recent history of body sizes within 82 molluscan genera show little support for the expectation that the modal size is an evolutionary attractor over geological time. 1752:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most models that examine the effects of habitat conversion on species extinctions assume that habitat conversion occurs at random. This assumption allows predictions about extinction rates based on the species area relationship. We show that the spatially aggregated nature of habitat conversion introduces a significant bias that may lead species loss rates to exceed those predicted by species area curves. Correlations between human activity and major compositional gradients or species richness also after predicted species extinction rates. We illustrate the consequences of nonrandom patterns of habitat conversion by using a data set that combines the distribution of native vascular plants with human activity patterns in California. 1753:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most studies examining continental to global patterns of species richness rely on the overlaying of extent of occurrence range maps. Because a species does not occur at all locations within its geographic range range map derived data represent actual distributional patterns only at some relatively coarse and undefined resolution. With the increasing availability of high resolution climate and land cover data broad scale studies are increasingly likely to estimate richness at high resolutions. Because of the scale dependence of most ecological phenomena a significant mismatch between the presumed and actual scale of ecological data may arise. This may affect conclusions regarding basic drivers of diversity and may lead to errors in the identification of diversity hotspots. Here we examine avian range maps of 834 bird species in conjunction with geographically extensive survey data sets on two continents to determine the spatial resolutions at which range map data actually characterize species occurrences and patterns of species richness. At resolutions less than 2 degrees (approximate to 200 km) range maps overestimate the area of occupancy of individual species and mischaracterize spatial patterns of species richness resulting in up to two thirds of biodiversity hotspots being misiclentified. The scale dependence of range map accuracy poses clear limitations on broad scale ecological analyses and conservation assessments. We suggest that range map data contain less information than is generally assumed and provide guidance about the appropriate scale of their use. 1758:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Patterns of species turnover are central to the geography of biodiversity and resulting challenges for conservation but at broad scales remain relatively little understood. Here we take a first spatially explicitly and global perspective to link the spatial turnover of species and environments. We compare how major groups of vertebrate ectotherms (amphibians) and endotherms (birds) respond to spatial environmental gradients. We find that high levels of species turnover occur regardless of environmental turnover rates but environmental turnover provides a lower bound for species turnover. This lower bound increases more steeply with environmental turnover in tropical realms. While bird and amphibian turnover rates are correlated the rate of amphibian turnover is four times steeper than bird rates. This is the same factor by which average geographic ranges of birds are larger than those of amphibians. Narrow ranged birds exhibit rapid rates of species turnover similar to those for amphibians while wide ranged birds largely drive the aggregate patterns of avian turnover. We confirm a strong influence of the environment on species turnover that is mediated by range sizes and regional history. In contrast to geographic patterns of species richness we find that the turnover in one group (amphibians) is a much better predictor for the turnover in another (birds) than is environment. This result confirms the role of amphibian sensitivity to environmental conditions for patterns of turnover and supports their value as a surrogate group. This spatially explicit analysis of environmental turnover provides understanding for conservation planning in changing environments. 1759:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phylogenies describe the origins and history of species. However they can also help to predict species fates and so can be useful tools for managing the future of biodiversity. This article starts by sketching how phylogenetic geographic and trait information can be combined to elucidate present mammalian diversity patterns and how they arose. Recent diversification rates and standing diversity show different geographic patterns indicating that cradles of diversity have moved over time. Patterns in extinction risk reflect both biological differences among mammalian lineages and differences in threat intensity among regions. Phylogenetic comparative analyses indicate that for small bodied mammals extinction risk is governed mostly by where the species live and the intensity of the threats whereas for large bodied mammals ecological differences also play an important role. This modeling approach identifies species whose intrinsic biology renders them particularly vulnerable to increased human pressure. We outline how the approach might be extended to consider future trends in anthropogenic drivers to identify likely future battlegrounds of mammalian conservation and the likely casualties. This framework could help to highlight consequences of choosing among different future climatic and socioeconomic scenarios. We end by discussing priority setting showing how alternative currencies for diversity can suggest very different priorities. We argue that aiming to maximize long term evolutionary responses is inappropriate that conservation planning needs to consider costs as well as benefits and that proactive conservation of largely intact systems should be part of a balanced strategy. 1764:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species area relationships have been observed for virtually all major groups of macroorganisms that have been studied to date but have not been explored for microscopic phytoplankton algae which are the dominant producers in many freshwater and marine ecosystems. Our analyses of data from 142 different natural ponds lakes and oceans and 239 experimental ecosystems reveal a strong species area relationship with an exponent that is invariant across ecosystems that span   15 orders of magnitude in spatial extent. A striking result is that the species area relationship derived from small scale experimental studies correctly scales up to natural aquatic ecosystems. These results significantly broaden our knowledge of the effects of island size on biodiversity and also confirm the relevance of experimentally derived data to the analysis and understanding of larger scale ecological patterns. In addition they confirm that patterns in microbial diversity are strongly consistent with those that have been repeatedly reported in the literature for macroorganisms. 176:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1773:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The size and metabolic rate of cells affect processes from the molecular to the organismal level. We present a quantitative theoretical framework for studying relationships among cell volume cellular metabolic rate body size and whole organism metabolic rate that helps reveal the feedback between these levels of organization. We use this framework to show that average cell volume and average cellular metabolic rate cannot both remain constant with changes in body size because of the well known body size dependence of whole organism metabolic rate. Based on empirical data compiled for 18 cell types in mammals we find that many cell types including erythrocytes hepatocytes fibroblasts and epithelial cells follow a strategy in which cellular metabolic rate is body size dependent and cell volume is body size invariant. We suggest that this scaling holds for all quickly dividing cells and conversely that slowly dividing cells are expected to follow a strategy in which cell volume is body size dependent and cellular metabolic rate is roughly invariant with body size. Data for slowly dividing neurons and adipocytes show that cell volume does indeed scale with body size. From these results we argue that the particular strategy followed depends on the structural and functional properties of the cell type. We also discuss consequences of these two strategies for cell number and capillary densities. Our results and conceptual framework emphasize fundamental constraints that link the structure and function of cells to that of whole organisms. 1792:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biologists have long searched for mechanisms responsible for the increase in species richness with decreasing latitude. The strong correlation between species richness and climate is frequently interpreted as reflecting a causal link via processes linked to energy or evolutionary rates. Here we investigate how the aggregation of clades as dictated by phylogeny can give rise to significant climate richness gradients without gradients in diversification or environmental carrying capacity. The relationship between climate and species richness varies considerably between clades regions and time periods in a global scale phylogenetically informed analysis of all terrestrial mammal species. Many young clades show negative richness temperature slopes (more species at cooler temperatures) with the ages of these clades coinciding with the expansion of temperate climate zones in the late Eocene. In carnivores we find steeply positive richness temperature slopes in clades with restricted distributions and tropical origins (e. g. cat clade) whereas widespread temperate clades exhibit shallow negative slopes (e. g. dog bear clade). We show that the slope of the global climate richness gradient in mammals is driven by aggregating Chiroptera (bats) with their Eutherian sister group. Our findings indicate that the evolutionary history should be accounted for as part of any search for causal links between environment and species richness. 1819:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The differences in the richness and prevalence of human pathogens among different geographical locations have ramifying consequences for societies and individuals. The relative contributions of different factors to these patterns however have not been fully resolved. We conduct a global analysis of the relative influence of climate alternative host diversity and spending on disease prevention on modern patterns in the richness and prevalence of human pathogens. Pathogen richness (number of kinds) is largely explained by the number of birds and mammal species in a region. The most diverse countries with respect to birds and mammals are also the most diverse with respect to pathogens. Importantly for human health the prevalence of key human pathogens (number of cases) is strongly influenced by disease control efforts. As a consequence even where disease richness is high we might still control prevalence particularly if we spend money in those regions where current spending is low prevalence is high and populations are large. 1823:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The extinction of species results in a permanent loss of evolutionary history. Recent theoretical studies show that this loss may be proportionally much smaller than the loss of species but under some conditions can exceed it. Such conditions occur when the phylogenetic tree that describes the evolutionary relationships among species is highly imbalanced due to differences between lineages in past speciation and or extinction rates. I used the taxonomy by C. G. Sibley and B. L. Monroe Jr to estimate the global loss of bird evolutionary history from historical and predicted extinctions and to quantify the ensuing changes in balance of the bird phylogenetic tree. In the global bird fauna evolutionary history is being lost at a high rate similar to the rate of species extinction. The bird phylogenetic tree is highly imbalanced and the imbalance is increased significantly by anthropogenic extinction. Historically the elevated loss of bird evolutionary history has been fuelled mostly by phylogenetic non randomness in the extinction of species but the direct effect of tree imbalance is substantial and could dominate in the future. 182:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,187:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1889:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding species richness spatial distribution is of fundamental importance to face the current biodiversity crisis that affects biotas around the world. Taxonomical covariation in species occurrence may offer the possibility to identify common factors that restrict species richness as well as some guidelines to the identification of key areas for conservation purposes. To this aim we analyze the geographic distribution of mammals and butterflies in Chile using 0.5 degrees latitude and longitude quadrats. We found that for both taxa there is a strong bell shaped latitudinal gradient in species richness with a peak at mid latitudes (33 43 degrees S). The results from multiple stepwise regression analysis shows that for both taxa productivity measured using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most important variable driving changes in species richness followed by glaciation and elevation depending on the taxa. Mid domain effects were either weak or unimportant in affecting the richness pattern. Variance partitioning analysis shows that the spatial components alone are irrelevant to the richness pattern. We show that spatial covariation in richness of butterflies and mammals is strongly influenced by spatial scale possibly as the result of a scale dependent effects oil individual species ranges whereas factors related to specific ecological characteristics are more important at smaller scales. Because richness gradients are ultimately the product of speciation and colonization processes oil longer time scales we propose that species richness gradients in Chile may be explained by the interaction between historical processes associated to desertification and glaciation together with productivity. The former sets the domain within which productivity produces a similar richness pattern for both taxa despite their different phylogenetic histories and physiological requirements. 1963:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial fingerprints of climate change on biotic communities are usually associated with changes in the distribution of species at their latitudinal or altitudinal extremes. By comparing the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species between 1905 and 1985 and 1986 and 2005 along the entire elevation range ( 0 to 2600 meters above sea level) in west Europe we show that climate warming has resulted in a significant upward shift in species optimum elevation averaging 29 meters per decade. The shift is larger for species restricted to mountain habitats and for grassy species which are characterized by faster population turnover. Our study shows that climate change affects the spatial core of the distributional range of plant species in addition to their distributional margins as previously reported. 1967:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The evolutionary dynamics underlying the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity have been controversial for over a century. Using a spatially explicit approach that incorporates not only origination and extinction but immigration a global analysis of genera and subgenera of marine bivalves over the past 11 million years supports an   out of the tropics model in which taxa preferentially originate in the tropics and expand toward the poles without losing their tropical presence. The tropics are thus both a cradle and a museum of biodversity contrary to the conceptual dichotomy dominant since 1974; a tropical diversity crisis would thus have profound evolutionary effects at all latitudes. 1972:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Two patterns in the distribution of species have become firmly but independently established in ecology: the species area curve which describes how rapidly the number of species increases with area and the positive relation between species geographical distribution and average local abundance. There is no generally agreed explanation of either pattern but for both the two main hypotheses are essentially the same: divergence of species along the ecological specialist generalist continuum and colonization extinction dynamics. A model is described that merges the two mechanisms predicts both patterns and thereby shows how the two general but formerly disconnected patterns are interrelated. 2000:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We study the problem of rewriting queries using views in the presence of access patterns integrity constraints disjunction and negation. We provide asymptotically optimal algorithms for (1) finding minimally containing and (2) maximally contained rewritings respecting the access patterns (which we call executable) and for (3) deciding whether an exact executable rewriting exists. We show that rewriting queries using views in this case reduces (a) to rewriting queries with access patterns and constraints without views and also (b) to rewriting queries using views under constraints without access patterns. We show how to solve (a) directly and how to reduce (b) to rewriting queries under constraints only (semantic optimization). These reductions provide two separate routes to a unified solution for problems 1 2 and 3 based on an extension of the relational chase theory to queries and constraints with disjunction and negation. We also handle equality and arithmetic comparisons. We also show that in an information integration setting maximally contained rewritings are given by the certain answers (under the usual semantics) for a set of constraints derived from the binding patterns. That is except for defining the appropriate constraints binding patterns do not need special treatment. Finally we show that if there is an exact executable rewriting there is an executable rewriting which is a union of conjunctive queries with negation. 2027:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central goal in ecology is to understand the spatial scaling of biodiversity. Patterns in the spatial distribution of organisms provide important clues about the underlying mechanisms that structure ecological communities and are central to setting conservation priorities. Although microorganisms comprise much of Earths biodiversity little is known about their biodiversity scaling relationships relative to that for plants and animals. Here we discuss current knowledge of microbial diversity at local and global scales. We focus on three spatial patterns: the distance decay relationship (how community composition changes with geographic distance) the taxa area relationship and the local: global taxa richness ratio. Recent empirical analyses of these patterns for microorganisms suggest that there are biodiversity scaling rules common to all forms of life. 209:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,218:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,226:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,229:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,236:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Debate on the mechanism(s) responsible for the scaling of metabolic rate with body size in mammals has focused on why the maximum metabolic rate (V(O2max)) appears to scale more steeply with body size than the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Consequently metabolic scope defined as V(O2max) BMR systematically increases with body size. These observations have led some to suggest that V(O2max) and BMR are controlled by fundamentally different processes and to discount the generality of models that predict a single power law scaling exponent for the size dependence of the metabolic rate. We present a model that predicts a steeper size dependence for V(O2max) than BMR based on the observation that changes in muscle temperature from rest to maximal activity are greater in larger mammals. Empirical data support the models prediction. This model thus provides a potential theoretical and mechanistic link between BMR and V(O2max). 24:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The distribution of the Anopheles gambiae complex of malaria vectors in Africa is uncertain due to under sampling of vast regions. We use ecologic niche modeling to predict the potential distribution of three members of the complex (A. gambiae A. arabiensis and A. quadriannulatus) and demonstrate the statistical significance of the models. Predictions correspond well to previous estimates but provide detail regarding spatial discontinuities in the distribution of A. gambiae s.s. that are consistent with population genetic studies. Our predictions also identify large areas of Africa where the presence of A. arabiensis is predicted but few specimens have been obtained suggesting under sampling of the species. Finally we project models developed from African distribution data for the late 1900s into the past and to South America to determine retrospectively whether the deadly 1929 introduction of A. gambiae sensu lato into Brazil was more likely that of A. gambiae sensu stricto or A. arabiensis. 273:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,282:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,283:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,286:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,288:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ability to extract amplify and sequence DNA from various types of tissues including bone minute larvae formalin fixed specimens and dried museum specimens has made it possible to address fundamental questions about evolution phylogeny and the genetic structure of populations. A major problem in studying evolutionary patterns in the deep sea is the difficulty of obtaining amplifiable DNA from small macrofaunal organisms (usually about 1.0 5.0 mm). these species live at very low density are collected from great depths (to 5000 m) and are typically fixed for 24 48h in 10 PeRcEnT buffered formalin and later transferred to 70 PeRcEnT ethanol. The effects of fixation and the very small amount of tissue in macrofaunal organisms have made it extremely difficult to obtain DNA sufficient for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Though several mentods have been published to extract DNA from formalin fixed tissues these have proved cumbersone with small amounts of tissue. We describe methods to extract and amplify mtDNA from formalin fixed deep sea molluscan species by: using a modification of a commercially available DNA extraction kit and developing species specific primers. One of the greatest challenges we faced was extracting sufficient quantities of amplifiable DNA from minute amounts of tissue. Further this material was extensively handled during the process and prone to contamination. 320:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,332:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,337:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,33:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,371:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent studies have shown substantial variation in metabolic scaling exponents (b) across plant and animal taxa. This contrasts with previous research that assumed metabolic rate scaled with mass according to a universal scaling law. The recently proposed Metabolic Level Boundaries (MLB) hypothesis states that b should vary between 0.67 and 1.0 and should be inversely related to metabolic level in resting organisms. Despite the predictive power of this hypothesis little is known about how ecological factors affect the scaling of metabolic rate with body size. The current study examines the influence of lifestyle and locomotory ability on metabolic level and scaling in fish species. Literature data for 96 species of teleost fish reveal that b varies inversely with resting metabolic level and is highest in deep sea fishes intermediate in demersal and benthopelagic fishes and lowest in pelagic fishes. This variation is consistent with the MLB hypothesis and may reflect differences in the amount of energetically expensive tissues  muscle cardiac and nervous tissue) needed for predator avoidance in different environments. Pelagic and benthopelagic species may require increased activity for predator avoidance while demersal and bathyl species are less prone to visual predation and so tend to be less athletic. The influences of swimming style and morphology on metabolic scaling are currently being investigated to further explore the links among lifestyle locomotory ability and metabolism. 372:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,378:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,38:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A species range can be a proxy for its ecological wellbeing. Species with small and shrinking range distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction. Future climate change scenarios are predicted to affect species geographical extents but data on how species distributions respond to changing climate are largely anecdotal and our understanding of the determinants and limits to species geographic ranges is surprisingly poor. Here we show that mammal species in more historically variable environments have larger geographical ranges. However the relationship between range size and long term climate trends cannot be explained by variation in our estimates of habitat specificity. We suggest that large oscillations in Quaternary temperatures may have shaped the contemporary distribution of range sizes via the selective extirpation of small ranged species during glacial expansion and or recolonization by good dispersers after glacial retreats. The effect of current climate change on species distributions and extinctions may therefore be determined by the geographical coincidence between historical and future climate scenarios the   mesh size   of the extinction dispersal filter imposed by past climate change and whether similar ecological and evolutionary responses to historical climatic change are appropriate in an increasingly transformed and fragmented landscape. 418:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,420:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,426:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We compared the distribution of historical bird and mammal species extinctions across genera and families with the distribution we would expect if these extinctions had occurred at random with respect to taxonomy We then repented the comparison for species listed in various categories of threat according to the 1996 Red List of the World Conservation Union. We found the distributions of extinctions and threat classifications to be almost always nonrandom   selective   with clustering in certain genera and families. Furthermore extinctions tended to be clustered in taxa that contain few species; species in smaller genera tended to have higher probabilities of extinction. This tendency was strong for historical extinctions but was reduced or absent for some categories of threat. We attribute this to a change in the causes of extinction where by predation and introduced species have been joined or superseded by widespread habitat loss. We then assessed the implications of this variable selectivity for the past and likely future losses of genera and families. In most cases the number of lost taxa rises. Finally we made predictions about minimum losses of taxa at specific dates in the future and showed that despite the reduction in some forms of selectivity we will still lose more ta ra than if species extinctions were random. 42:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although it is commonly assumed that closely related animals are similar in body size the degree of similarity has not been examined across the taxonomic hierarchy. Moreover little is known about the variation or consistency of body size patterns across geographic space or evolutionary time. Here we draw from a data set of terrestrial nonvolant mammals to quantify and compare patterns across the body size spectrum the taxonomic hierarchy continental space and evolutionary time. We employ a variety of statistical techniques including   sib sib   regression phylogenetic autocorrelation and nested ANOVA. We find an extremely high resemblance ( heritability) of size among congeneric species for mammals over similar to 18 g; the result is consistent across the size spectrum. However there is no significant relationship among the body sizes of congeneric species for mammals under similar to 18 g. We suspect that life history and ecological parameters are so tightly constrained by allometry at diminutive size that animals can only adapt to novel ecological conditions by modifying body size. The overall distributions of size for each continental fauna and for the most diverse orders are quantitatively similar for North America South America and Africa despite virtually no overlap in species composition. Differences in ordinal composition appear to account for quantitative differences between continents. For most mammalian orders body size is highly conserved although there is extensive overlap at all levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. The body size distribution for terrestrial mammals apparently was established early in the Tertiary and it has remained remarkably constant over the past 50 Ma and across the major continents. Lineages have diversified in size to exploit environmental opportunities but only within limits set by allometric ecological and evolutionary constraints. 483:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Does the shape of a biogeographical region influence its spatial patterns of species richness? A complete answer must include careful distinction between the distribution of a species which is a complex geometric object and the range of a species which is relatively simple especially when reduced to one dimension. We consider range based models of species richness in particular range overlap counts in one dimension for which we give a unified mathematical treatment via the joint probability P(m l) of midpoints and lengths of ranges. We discuss a number of difficulties in practice and in principle using range based models and show that the so called mid domain effect a proposed null model for the effect of geometric constraint is qualitatively a property of all biologically realistic models based on range overlap counts. As such range based models provide little insight into understanding or explaining biogeographical patterns in species richness. We characterize the quantitative null model for range overlap counts in one dimension for which we give a simple and direct field test based on P(m l). We apply this test to a large clade in a complete bioregion (the Proteaceae of the Cape Floristic Region): geometric constraint does not explain the spatial pattern in this case. We show that any geometric constraint on species richness including range overlap counts must act via edge effects. Thus to understand biogeographical patterns an understanding of the effects and consequences of edges is fundamental. 488:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, While it is a truism that species rarity is non randomly distributed across regions habitats and taxa there is little consensus on which factors are the best predictors of low abundances and restricted geographical ranges. In this study we evaluate the effects of ecological and life history traits as well as phylogeny on rarity in the abundance and distribution of land birds inhabiting forest habitats in the Mediterranean and temperate regions of Chile. We use data on abundance collected at 16 sites and data on latitudinal distribution obtained from a literature compilation. Statistical analyses were based on multiple regression and multivariate models. We used Signed Mantel test to analyse the relationship between species ecological and life history traits and rarity taking into account the effect of phylogenetic relatedness. We found that rarity in terms of distribution is associated with a low investment in reproduction non migratory status and degree of habitat specialization. These ecological and life history traits in association with forest loss due to climatic changes and human impacts may explain the narrow distribution of most endemic forest birds species. Rarity in abundance on the other hand is more difficult to explain. However the fact that large species with an insectivorous diet showed low density in the assemblages studied suggests that abundance is mostly regulated by energy (resource) requirements and availability. Finally our study shows that there is no phylogenetic influence in the observed patterns. 490:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Accurate predictions of the potential distribution of range shifting species are required for effective management of invasive species and for assessments of the impact of climate change on native species. Range shifting species pose a challenge for traditional correlative approaches to range prediction often requiring the extrapolation of complex statistical associations into novel environmental space. Here we take an alternative approach that does not use species occurrence data but instead captures the fundamental niche of a species by mechanistically linking key organismal traits with spatial data using biophysical models. We demonstrate this approach with a major invasive species the cane toad Bufo marinus in Australia assessing the direct climatic constraints on its ability to move survive and reproduce. We show that the current range can be explained by thermal constraints on the locomotor potential of the adult stage together with limitations on the availability of water for the larval stage. Our analysis provides a framework for biologically grounded predictions of the potential for cane toads to expand their range under current and future climate scenarios. More generally by quantifying spatial variation in physiological constraints on an organism trait based approaches can be used to investigate the range limits of any species. Assessments of spatial variation in the physiological constraints on an organism may also provide a mechanistic basis for forecasting the rate of range expansion and for understanding a species potential to evolve at range edges. Mechanistic approaches thus have broad application to process based ecological and evolutionary models of range shift. 497:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plant species sharing pollinators may compete through pollination. This type of competition may lead to overdispersed flowering phenologies. However phenological segregation is difficult to detect in seasonal climates. We compared patterns of phenological overlap in assemblages of ornithophilous plants from three localities of the temperate forest of southern South America with those generated by four different null models. These species were all visited and presumably pollinated by a single species the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes which makes this situation ideal to evaluate the role of pollination mediated competition. For one site we compiled data on flowering phenologies for three different years. Three models considered the flowering period of the whole assemblage of ornithophilous plants as the phenological window within which flowering phenologies were randomized but made no further assumptions on how species should be distributed within that temporal frame. The fourth model assigned differential probabilities to different time intervals based on the flowering onset of non ornithophilous plant species. Observed mean pairwise overlaps for all localities and years were well within the interval defined by the 2.5 and 97.5 PeRcEnT percentiles of the randomized distribution of expected mean pairwise overlaps according to models 1 3. However model 4 showed a consistent trend towards overdispersion of ornihophilous phenologies which show a shift towards mid to late summer flowering. Thus to the extent that the distribution of flowering of non ornithophilous species reflects the constraints imposed by a highly seasonal climate our results provide support to the proposal that pollinator sharing may cause evolutionary displacement or ecological sorting of flowering phenologies. Other factors such as phylogenetic inertia could also contribute to explain extant phenological patterns in the highly endemic ornithophilous flora of the temperate forest of southern South America. 50:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,51:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,529:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,52:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Clusters Of range boundaries in coastal marine species often occur at shoreline locations where major nearshore ocean currents collide. Observing that these currents are typically composed of waters with quite different physical characteristics biologists have traditionally assumed that high local densities of marine range limits result primarily from the strong water property gradients (particularly in temperature) that arise at oceanographic discontinuities. However this view may overlook the potential for ocean flows themselves to generate distributional pattern. Here we explore this possibility in more detail using an extension of a coupled population dispersal model developed previously for benthic marine species with dispersing larvae. Results suggest that simple common flow fields often observed in association with biogeographic boundaries worldwide may have the potential to constrain a species geographic range even when suitable habitat outside that range is abundant. Model predictions suggest that these boundaries can function as one or two way barriers to range expansion and may be differentially permeable with boundary leakiness depending on life history characteristics and the degree of temporal variability in the nearshore flow field. 600:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Data were compiled from the literature and our own studies on 24 ant species to characterise the effects of body size and temperature on forager running speed. Running speed increases with temperature in a manner consistent with the effects of temperature on metabolic rate and the kinetic properties of muscles. The exponent of the body mass running speed allometry ranged from 0.14 to 0.34 with a central tendency of approximately 0.25. This body mass scaling is consistent with both the model of elastic similarity and a model combining dynamic similarity with available metabolic power. Even after controlling for body size or temperature a substantial amount of inter specific variation in running speed remains. Species with certain lifestyles nomadic group predators species which forage at extreme (  60 degrees C) temperatures may have been selected for faster running speeds. Although ants have a similar scaling exponent to mammals for the running speed allometry they run slower than predicted compared with a hypothetical mammal of similar size. This may in part reflect physiological differences between invertebrates and vertebrates. 617:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,644:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The purpose of this data set was to compile body mass information for all mammals on Earth so that we could investigate the patterns of body mass seen across geographic and taxonomic space and evolutionary time. We were interested in the heritability of body size across taxonomic groups (How conserved is body mass within a genus family and order?) in the overall pattern of body mass across continents (Do the moments and other descriptive statistics remain the same across geographic space?) and over evolutionary time (How quickly did body mass patterns iterate on the patterns seen today? Were the Pleistocene extinctions size specific on each continent and did these events coincide with the arrival of man?). These data are also part of a larger project that seeks to integrate body mass patterns across very diverse taxa (NCEAS Working Group on Body Size in Ecology and Paleoecology: linking pattern and process across space time and taxonomic scales). We began with the updated version of D. E. Wilson and D. M. Reeders taxonomic list of all known Recent mammals of the world (N 5 4629 species) to which we added status distribution and body mass estimates compiled from the primary and secondary literature. Whenever possible we used an average of male and female body mass which was in turn averaged over multiple localities to arrive at our species body mass values. The sources are line referenced in the main data set with the actual references appearing in a table within the metadata. Mammals have individual records for each continent they occur on. Note that our data set is more than an amalgamation of smaller compilations. Although we relied heavily on a data set for Chiroptera by K. E. Jones (N 5 905) the CRC handbook of Mammalian Body Mass (N 5 688) and a data set compiled for South America by P. Marquet (N 5 505) these represent less than half the records in the current database. The remainder are derived from more than 150 other sources. Furthermore we include a comprehensive late Pleistocene species assemblage for Africa North and South America and Australia (an additional 230 species). Late Pleistocene is defined as approximately 11 ka for Africa North and South America and as 50 ka for Australia because these times predate anthropogenic impacts on mammalian fauna. Estimates contained within this data set represent a generalized species value averaged across sexes and geographic space. Consequently these data are not appropriate for asking population level questions where the integration of body mass with specific environmental conditions is important. All extant orders of mammals are included as well as several archaic groups (N 5 4859 species). Because some species are found on more than one continent (particularly Chiroptera) there are 5731 entries. We have body masses for the following: Artiodactyla (280 records) Bibymalagasia (2 records) Carnivora (393 records) Cetacea (75 records) Chiroptera (1071 records) Dasyuromorphia (67 records) Dermoptera (3 records) Didelphimorphia (68 records) Diprotodontia (127 records) Hydracoidea (5 records) Insectivora (234 records) Lagomorpha (53 records) Litopterna (2 records) Macroscelidea (14 records) Microbiotheria (1 record) Monotremata (7 records) Notoryctemorphia (1 record) Notoungulata (5 records) Paucituberculata (5 records) Peramelemorphia (24 records) Perissodactyla (47 records) Pholidota (8 records) Primates (276 records) Proboscidea (14 records) Rodentia (1425 records) Scandentia (15 records) Sirenia (6 records) Tubulidentata (1 record) and Xenarthra (75 records). 658:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A. global analysis of elevational diversity trends for nonvolant small mammals revealed a clear pattern of mid elevational peaks in species richness. Fifty six data sets were used to test the predictions of a null model (the mid domain effect) and climatic hypotheses. Very few data sets fit entirely within the predictions of the null model and the average predictive power of the null model was low. Regional (gamma) diversity fit the null model better than did local (alpha) diversity. Diversity peaked at higher elevations on taller mountains consistent with climatic factors producing elevationally correlated habitat bands (Massenerhebung effect). This positive linear relationship was documented for all data sets but was particularly pronounced for alpha diversity. Gamma diversity which is generally highly influenced by area exhibited a trend of highest diversity shifting toward lower elevations and higher elevational peaks in species diversity at higher latitudes. The elevation of temperate diversity peaks exhibited a negative association with latitude. These results are evidence for the importance of a suite of interacting climatic area and geometric factors on elevational diversity patterns apparent in spite of noise associated with different sampling techniques localities and historical pressures. 659:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although an ecosystems response to biodiversity loss depends on the order in which species are lost the extinction sequences generally used to explore such responses in food webs have been ecologically unrealistic. We investigate how several extinction orders affect the minimum number of secondary extinctions expected within pelagic food webs from 34 temperate freshwater lakes. An ecologically plausible extinction order is derived from the geographically nested pattern of species composition among the lakes and is corroborated by species pH tolerances. Simulations suggest that lake communities are remarkably robust to this realistic extinction order and highly sensitive to the reverse sequence of species loss. This sensitivity is not well explained by the known sensitivity of networks to the loss of highly connected species but appears to be better explained by our observation that trophic specialists preferentially consume widely distributed species at low risk of extinction. Our results highlight an important aspect of community organization that may help to maintain biodiversity amidst changing environments. 66:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large mammals are thought to evolve to be smaller on islands whereas small mammals grow larger. A negative correlation between relative size of island individuals and body mass is termed the   island rule.   Several mechanisms mainly competitive release resource limitation dispersal ability and lighter predation pressure on islands as well as a general physiological advantage of modal size have been advanced to explain this pattern. We measured skulls and teeth of terrestrial members of the order Carnivora in order to analyze patterns of body size evolution between insular populations and their near mainland conspecifics. No correlations were found between the size ratios of insular mainland carnivore species and body mass. Only little support for the island rule is found when individual populations rather than species are considered. Our data are at odds with those advanced in support of theories of optimal body size. Carnivore size is subjected to a host of selective pressures that do not vary uniformly from place to place. Mass alone cannot account for the patterns in body size of insular carnivores. 677:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Considerable controversy surrounds the importance of historical evolutionary and ecological factors affecting continental patterns in species richness. Although the importance of area and latitude are both well documented few attempts have been made to integrate their effects in a single model. Most studies have been conducted by superimposing grids on equal area projection maps and counting the number of species occurring within grid cells  quadrats). Unfortunately different grid based studies use different quadrat sizes making comparisons tenuous. We developed a hierarchical model to evaluate the degree to which area (based on a nested series of quadrats of five sizes 1000 25 000 km(2)) affects the latitudinal gradient in species richness. The model allows the relationship between latitude and area to be nonlinear and in its simple form evaluates how well species richness can be predicted by the additive influences of latitude and area. The complex model evaluates whether an area x latitude interaction accounts for significant additional variation in species richness above that in the simple model  assesses the scale dependence of the latitudinal gradient). For bats and marsupials the simple model included only latitudinal effects and accounted for over half of the variation in species richness of each of the two taxa. The interactive effect was nonsignificant for each taxon accounting for  0.1 PeRcEnT of additional variation in species richness in each case. If other taxa or land masses produce similar relationships then the form of the latitudinal gradient is relatively invariant with respect to area at 1000 25 000 km(2) scales and comparisons among studies at this spatial scale are straightforward. 692:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Elevational gradients hold enormous potential for understanding general properties of biodiversity. Like latitudinal gradients the hypotheses for diversity patterns can be grouped into historical explanations climatic drivers and spatial hypotheses. The spatial hypotheses include the species area effect and spatial constraint ( mid domain effect null models). I test these two spatial hypotheses using regional diversity patterns for mammals ( non volant small mammals and bats) along 34 elevational gradients spanning 24.4 degrees S 40.4 degrees N latitude. There was high variability in the fit to the species area hypothesis and the mid domain effect. Both hypotheses can be eliminated as primary drivers of elevational diversity. Area and spatial constraint both represent sources of error rather than mechanisms underlying these mammalian diversity patterns. Similar results are expected for other vertebrate taxa plants and invertebrates since they show comparable distributions of elevational diversity patterns to mammalian patterns. 712:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, J. M. Diamonds assembly rules model predicts that competitive interactions between species lead to nonrandom co occurrence patterns. We conducted a meta analysis of 96 published presence absence matrices and used a realistic   null model   to generate patterns expected in the absence of species interactions. Published matrices were highly nonrandom and matched the predictions of Diamonds model: there were fewer species combinations more checkerboard species pairs and less co occurrence in real matrices than expected by chance. Moreover nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamonds controversial assembly rules model they do establish that observed co occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance. These results contrast with previous analyses of species co occurrence patterns and bridge the apparent gap between experimental and correlative studies in community ecology. 728:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phylogenetic diversity area curves are analogous to species area curves and quantify the relationship between the phylogenetic diversity of species assemblages and the area over which assemblages are sampled. Here we developed theoretical expectations of these curves under different ecological and macroevolutionary processes. We first used simulations to generate curves expected under three ecological community assembly processes: species sorting where species have distinct environmental preferences; random placement where species have no environmental preference but vary in their prevalence across communities; and limited dispersal where species have no environmental preference but vary in their ability to disperse. Second we simulated curves expected across regions  across oceanic islands) that are derived from colonization among regions within region speciation and extinction. We also computed curves for two data sets one on forest plots along an elevation gradient and the other on Caribbean island Anolis lizards. Of the three ecological processes only species sorting produced strong relationships between phylogenetic diversity and area. The forest plot curves matched the species sorting expectation but only when phylogenetic repulsion (that caused closely related species to be found in similar habitats but not in the same plots) was also included in the simulation. Strong relationships between regional phylogenetic diversity and area were simulated if species were derived only from within region speciation; colonizations among regions obscured the pattern. Similarly larger Caribbean islands had more within island speciation and contained more Anolis phylogenetic diversity than smaller islands but colonizations among islands obscured this relationship. This work furthers our understanding of the processes that govern the phylogenetic diversity of ecological communities and biogeographic regions. 745:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recruitment variation can be a major source of fluctuation in populations and communities making it difficult to generalize results. Determining the scales of variation and whether spatial patterns in the supply of individuals are persistent over time can provide insight into spatial generality and the application of conservation and metacommunity models. We examined these issues using eight year long data sets of monthly recruitment of intertidal mussels (Mytilus spp. Perumytilus purpuratus Semimytilus algosus Brachidontes granulata) and barnacles (Balanus glandula Chthamalus dalli Jehlius cirratus Notochthamalus scabrosus) at sites spanning  900 km along the coasts of Oregon northern California (OR NCA 45.47 39.43 degrees N) and central Chile (CC 29.5 34.65 degrees S). We evaluated four general   null   hypotheses: that despite different phylogenies and great spatial separation of these taxa their similar life history strategies and environmental settings lead to similar patterns of recruitment (1) between hemispheres (2) in time (3) in space and (4) at larger and smaller spatial scales. Hypothesis I was rejected: along the OR NCA coast rates of recruitment were between two and three orders of magnitude higher and patterns of seasonality were generally stronger and more coherent across space and time than along CC. Surprisingly however further analysis revealed regularities in both time and space for all species supporting hypotheses 2 and Temporal decorrelation scales were 1 3 months and characteristic spatial scales of recruitment were similar to 250 km. Contrary to hypothesis 4 for the ecologically dominant species in both hemispheres recruitment was remarkably persistent at larger mesoscales (kilometers) but was highly stochastic at smaller microscales (meters). Across species increased recruitment variation at large scales was positively associated with increased persistence. Our results have several implications. Although the two regions span distinct latitudinal ranges potential forcing processes behind these patterns include similar large scale climates and topographically locked hydrographic features such as upwelling. Further spatial persistence of the recruitment patterns of most species at the mesoscale supports the view that marine protected areas can be powerful conservation and management tools. Finally persistent and yet contrasting spatial patterns of recruitment among competing species suggest that recent metacommunity models might provide useful representations of the mechanisms involved in species coexistence. 760:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The latitudinal gradient of species richness is well documented for a variety of taxa in both terrestrial and aquatic environs. Moreover a number of recent attempts to assess the effects of scale on the relationship have concluded that the latitudinal pattern is scale invariant. Nonetheless the power of those approaches is predicated on precise knowledge of the forms of the latitudinal gradient the area relationship and their interaction. We used a model developed by J. Pastor A. Downing and H. E. Erickson for assessing the effects of scale on the productivity diversity gradient to avoid such complications. More specifically for 253 sets of nested quadrats (1000 25000 km(2)) located throughout the New World we parameterized the power function and determined whether those parameters varied in a systematic fashion with latitude. Significant latitude induced monotonic variation in the rate of species accumulation with area (z parameter) documented scale sensitivity for both bats and marsupials with z decreasing toward tropical latitudes. Variation in the intercept parameter (C) reflected the latitudinal gradient in richness after adjustment for the latitude specific effects of area. Both bats and marsupials exhibited strong gradients of richness. with modal values in the tropics. Mechanisms affecting species richness. or the size of ranges and the juxtapositioning of their boundaries. may initiate scale sensitivity in many systems. A number of mechanistic or phenomenological models (environmental geometric constraint and Rapoport rescue hypotheses) thought to produce the latitudinal gradient also enhance the likelihood of scale sensitivity. Consequently investigations of other macroecological gradients of richness  elevation depth and productivity) that should be affected by such factors are probably also scale sensitive. 791:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examine co occurrence patterns of microorganisms to evaluate community assembly   rules. We use methods previously applied to macroorganisms both to evaluate their applicability to microorganisms and to allow comparison of co occurrence patterns observed in microorganisms to those found in macroorganisms. We use a null model analysis of 124 incidence matrices from microbial communities including bacteria archaea fungi and algae and we compare these results to previously published findings from a meta analysis of almost 100 macroorganism data sets. We show that assemblages of microorganisms demonstrate nonrandom patterns of co occurrence that are broadly similar to those found in assemblages of macroorganisms. These results suggest that some taxon co occurrence patterns may be general characteristics of communities of organisms from all domains of life. We also find that co occurrence in microbial communities does not vary among taxonomic groups or habitat types. However we find that the degree of co occurrence does vary among studies that use different methods to survey microbial communities. Finally we discuss the potential effects of the undersampling of microbial communities on our results as well as processes that may contribute to nonrandom patterns of co occurrence in both macrobial and microbial communities such as competition habitat filtering historical effects and neutral processes. 7:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,80:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One of the primary ecological hypotheses put forward to explain patterns of biodiversity is known as the more individuals hypothesis of species energy theory. This hypothesis suggests that the number of species increases along the global energy gradient primarily as a result of an increase in the total number of individuals that can be supported along that gradient. Implicit in this hypothesis is that species richness should scale with energy in the same way in which it scales with area in species area relationships. We developed a novel framework for thinking about the interaction of area and energy and we provide the first global test of this equivalence assumption using a data set on terrestrial breeding birds. We found that (1) species energy slopes are typically greater than species area slopes (2) the magnitude of species area and species energy slopes varies strongly across the globe and (3) the degree to which area and energy interact to determine species richness depends on the way mean values of species occupancy change along the energy gradient. Our results indicate that the increase in richness along global productivity gradients cannot be explained by more individuals alone and we discuss other mechanisms by which increased productivity might facilitate species coexistence. 813:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A latitudinal gradient in biodiversity has existed since before the time of the dinosaurs yet how and why this gradient arose remains unresolved. Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than and nested within tropical taxa and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation or faster molecular evolution or the increased importance of biotic interactions) or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research. 821:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Broad scale variation in taxonomic richness is strongly correlated with climate. Many mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain these patterns; however testable predictions that would distinguish among them have rarely been derived. Here we examine several prominent hypotheses for climate richness relationships deriving and testing predictions based on their hypothesized mechanisms. The energy richness hypothesis (also called the more individuals hypothesis) postulates that more productive areas have more individuals and therefore more species. More productive areas do often have more species but extant data are not consistent with the expected causal relationship from energy to numbers of individuals to numbers of species. We reject the energy richness hypothesis in its standard form and consider some proposed modifications. The physiological tolerance hypothesis postulates that richness varies according to the tolerances of individual species for different sets of climatic conditions. This hypothesis predicts that more combinations of physiological parameters can survive under warm and wet than cold or dry conditions. Data are qualitatively consistent with this prediction but are inconsistent with the prediction that species should fill climatically suitable areas. Finally the speciation rate hypothesis postulates that speciation rates should vary with climate due either to faster evolutionary rates or stronger biotic interactions increasing the opportunity for evolutionary diversification in some regions. The biotic interactions mechanism also has the potential to amplify shallower underlying gradients in richness. Tests of speciation rate hypotheses are few (to date) and their results are mixed. 833:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem properties result in part from the characteristics of individual organisms. How these individual traits scale to impact ecosystem level processes is currently unclear. Because metabolism is a fundamental process underlying many individual and population level variables it provides a mechanism for linking individual characteristics with large scale processes. Here we use metabolism and ecosystem thermodynamics to scale from physiology to individual biomass production and population level energy use. Temperature corrected rates of individual level biomass production show the same body size dependence across a wide range of aerobic eukaryotes from unicellular organisms to mammals and vascular plants. Population level energy use for both mammals and plants are strongly influenced by both metabolism and thermodynamic constraints on energy exchange between trophic levels. Our results show that because metabolism is a fundamental trait of organisms it not only provides a link between individual and ecosystem level processes but can also highlight other import ant factors constraining ecological structure and dynamics. 852:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Metabolic energy fuels all biological processes and therefore theories that explain the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass potentially have great predictive power in ecology. A new model that could improve this predictive power postulates that the metabolic scaling exponent (b) varies between 2 3 and 1 and is inversely related to the elevation of the intraspecific scaling relationship (metabolic level L) which in turn varies systematically among species in response to various ecological factors. We test these predictions by examining the effects of lifestyle swimming mode and temperature on intraspecific scaling of resting metabolic rate among 89 species of teleost fish. As predicted b decreased as L increased with temperature and with shifts in lifestyle from bathyal and benthic to benthopelagic to pelagic. This effect of lifestyle on b may be related to varying amounts of energetically expensive tissues associated with different capacities for swimming during predator prey interactions. 854:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the end Pleistocene extinction of large bodied mammals. The disease hypothesis attributes the extinction to the arrival of a novel hyperdisease brought by immigrating aboriginal humans. However until West Nile virus (WNV) invaded the United States no known disease met the criteria of a hyperdisease. We evaluate the disease hypothesis using WNV in the United States as a model system. We show that WNV is size biased in its infection of North America birds but is unlikely to result in an extinction similar to that of the end Pleistocene. WNV infects birds more uniformly across the body size spectrum than extinctions did across mammals and is not size biased within orders. Our study explores the potential impact of WNV on bird populations and provides no support for disease as a causal mechanism for the end Pleistocene megafaunal extinction. 866:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Patterns of ecotypic variation constitute some of the few rules known to modern biology. Here we examine several well known ecogeographical rules especially those pertaining to body size in contemporary historical and fossil taxa. We review the evidence showing that rules of geographical variation in response to variation in the local environment can also apply to morphological changes through time in response to climate change. These rules hold at various time scales ranging from contemporary to geological time scales. Patterns of body size variation in response to climate change at the individual species level may also be detected at the community level. The patterns underlying ecotypic variation are complex and highly context dependent reducing the predictive power of ecogeographical rules. This is especially true when considering the increasing impact of human activities on the environment. Nonetheless ecogeographical rules may help interpret the likely influences of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems. Global climate change has already influenced the body size of several contemporary species and will likely have an even greater impact on animal communities in the future. For this reason we highlight and emphasise the importance of museum specimens and the continued need for documenting the earths biological diversity. 89:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species diversity gradients seen today are to a large degree a product of history. Spatially nonrandom originations extinctions and changes in geographic distributions can create gradients in species and higher taxon richness but the relative roles of each of these processes remain poorly documented. Existing explanations of diversity gradients have tended to focus on either macroevolutionary or biogeographic processes; integrative models that include both are largely lacking. We used simple models that incorporate origination and extinction rates along with dispersal of taxa between regions to show that dispersal not only affects regional richness patterns but also has a strong influence on the average age of taxa present in a region. Failure to take into account the effects of dispersal can in principle lead to biased estimates of diversification rates and potentially wrong conclusions regarding processes driving latitudinal and other gradients in diversity. Thus it is critical to include the effects of dispersal when formulating and testing hypotheses about the causes of large scale gradients in diversity. Finally the model results in conjunction with the results of existing empirical studies suggest that the nature of macroevolutionary and biogeographic processes may differ between terrestrial and marine diversity gradients. 914:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding how animals interact with their environment is critical for evaluating mitigating and coping with anthropogenic alteration of Earths biosphere. Researchers have attempted to understand some aspects of these interactions by examining patterns in animal body mass distributions. Energetic phylogenetic biogeographical textural discontinuity and community interaction hypotheses have been advanced to explain observed patterns. Energetic and textural discontinuity hypotheses focus upon the allometry of resource use. The community interaction hypothesis contends that biotic interactions within assemblages of species are of primary importance. Biogeographical and phylogenetic hypotheses focus on the role of constraints on the organization of communities. This paper examines and organizes these various propositions about species body mass distributions and discusses the multiple competing hypotheses how their predictions vary and possible methods by which the hypotheses can be distinguished and tested. Each of the hypotheses is partial and explains some elements of pattern in body mass distributions. The scale of appropriate application relevance and interpretation varies among the hypotheses and the mechanisms underlying observed patterns are likely to be multicausal and vary with scale. 915:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the causes of spatial variation in species richness is a major research focus of biogeography and macroecology. Gridded environmental data and species richness maps have been used in increasingly sophisticated curve fitting analyses but these methods have not brought us much closer to a mechanistic understanding of the patterns. During the past two decades macroecologists have successfully addressed technical problems posed by spatial autocorrelation intercorrelation of predictor variables and non linearity. However curve fitting approaches are problematic because most theoretical models in macroecology do not make quantitative predictions and they do not incorporate interactions among multiple forces. As an alternative we propose a mechanistic modelling approach. We describe computer simulation models of the stochastic origin spread and extinction of species geographical ranges in an environmentally heterogeneous gridded domain and describe progress to date regarding their implementation. The output from such a general simulation model (GSM) would at a minimum consist of the simulated distribution of species ranges on a map yielding the predicted number of species in each grid cell of the domain. In contrast to curve fitting analysis simulation modelling explicitly incorporates the processes believed to be affecting the geographical ranges of species and generates a number of quantitative predictions that can be compared to empirical patterns. We describe three of the control knobs for a GSM that specify simple rules for dispersal evolutionary origins and environmental gradients. Binary combinations of different knob settings correspond to eight distinct simulation models five of which are already represented in the literature of macroecology. The output from such a GSM will include the predicted species richness per grid cell the range size frequency distribution the simulated phylogeny and simulated geographical ranges of the component species all of which can be compared to empirical patterns. Challenges to the development of the GSM include the measurement of goodness of fit (GOF) between observed data and model predictions as well as the estimation optimization and interpretation of the model parameters. The simulation approach offers new insights into the origin and maintenance of species richness patterns and may provide a common framework for investigating the effects of contemporary climate evolutionary history and geometric constraints on global biodiversity gradients. With further development the GSM has the potential to provide a conceptual bridge between macroecology and historical biogeography. 91:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,91:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species richness is decreasing at a global scale. At sub global scales that is within any defined area less extensive than the globe species richness will increase when the number of nonnative species becoming naturalized is greater than the number of native species becoming extinct. Determining whether this has occurred is usually difficult because detailed records of species extinctions and naturalizations are rare; these records often exist however for oceanic islands. Here we show that species richness on oceanic islands has remained relatively unchanged for land birds with the number of naturalizations being roughly equal to the number of extinctions and has increased dramatically for vascular plants with the number of naturalizations greatly exceeding the number of extinctions. In fact for plants the net number of species on islands has approximately doubled. We show further that these patterns are robust to differences in the history of human occupation of these islands and to the possibility of undocumented species extinctions. These results suggest that species richness may be increasing at subglobal scales for many groups and that future research should address what consequences this may have on ecological processes. 921:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We used null model analysis to test for nonrandomness in the structure of metazoan ectoparasite communities of 45 species of marine fish. Host species consistently supported fewer parasite species combinations than expected by chance even in analyses that incorporated empty sites. However for most analyses the null hypothesis was not rejected and co occurrence patterns could not be distinguished from those that might arise by random colonization and extinction. We compared our results to analyses of presence absence matrices for vertebrate taxa and found support for the hypothesis that there is an ecological continuum of community organization. Presence absence matrices for small bodied taxa with low vagility and or small populations (marine ectoparasites herps) were mostly random whereas presence absence matrices for large bodied taxa with high vagility and or large populations (birds mammals) were highly structures. Metazoan ectoparasites of marine fishes fall near the low end of this continuum with little evidence for nonrandom species co occurrence patterns. 933:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The five articles in this special feature extend the discovery of regular patterns of deviation from scaling laws and from continuous distributions of attributes in ecosystems and other complex systems. These patterns suggest that these systems organize over discrete ranges of scale and that organization abruptly shifts with changes in scale. If this is so scaling laws serve only as the baseline from which to measure those departures and those departures indicate scale breaks (transitions) between scales of structure in complex systems. Patterns in the deviations from a scaling law baseline may provide hints of the processes that cause the emergence of the scaling relationships themselves. At minimum the investigation of departures from scaling laws gives us a clue into the nature of structure and process in ecological systems. Ecosystems may be structured by relatively few key processes each operating at specific temporal and spatial scales. The distinct temporal frequencies and spatial scale characterizing these processes creates landscape structures with scale specific pattern . This may in turn entrain attributes of animals residing on the landscape because different sized animals living upon the same landscape perceive their environment at different scales. Holling suggested that this entrainment reflects adaptations to the discontinuous pattern of resource distribution acting through animal community assembly and evolution both by sorting species and by providing a specific set of evolutionary opportunities and constraints. On the animal community level this should be expressed by a discontinuous distribution of species body masses. Within a system aggregations of species body masses are separated by discrete breaks (or discontinuities) separating different ranges of scale. Animals within a particular body mass aggregation perceive and exploit the environment at the same range of scale. Hollings proposition that ecosystem structure entrains attributes of animals__such as body mass distributions (the textural discontinuity hypothesis)__ was received with some skepticism but also with interest. It is now generally accepted that many attributes of ecosystems are discontinuously distributed but mechanisms other than entrainment by ecological structure have been proposed. However most of the disagreements with Hollings proposition have been technical focusing on the methods used to detect discontinuities. New evidence for a link between landscape structure at different scales and body mass distributions has provided support for the textural discontinuity hypothesis. Discontinuous body mass patterns have been documented in many systems. The analyses of Raffaelli and others and Havlicek and Carpenter further suggest that discontinuous patterns within animal body mass distributions are conservative robust to perturbations and species turnover. The association of scale breaks with attributes of species independent of the determination of body mass structure invasiveness and decline has provided additional support that the patterns identified in body mass distributions are in fact real. The analysis of landscape patterns has demonstrated that changes in spatial pattern across different ranges of scales are described by different scaling relationships and the analysis of the relationship between species richness and spatial scale has established the existence of different scaling relationships at different scales. In between scales there are sharp breaks between these scaling regimes. For obvious reasons a direct experimental link between body mass aggregations and landscape pattern across scales remains elusive but a relationship between body mass and vegetation structure has been demonstrated. Raffaelli and others were able to conduct manipulations of marine sediment invertebrate assemblages and they established that perturbations affected densities and abundance of taxa but that patterns in the size spectra were conserved. They concluded that the size spectra were probably constrained by habitat structure. In this special feature of Ecosystems we further explore the causes commonality and consequences of discontinuous structure in complex systems with a focus on ecosystems. This feature consists of five papers. The first outlines the difficulties and suggests a remedy in analyzing seemingly intractable ecological data where causes are multiple scales of influence many and experimental manipulation impossible. Statistics especially frequentist statistics fail to detect pattern in data such as body mass or city size distributions; and the manipulation of entire ecosystems at multiple scales with replication is more than a challenge. Thus a more fluid approach is needed to determine the most likely mechanisms underlying discontinuities and to make comparisons of patterns among different systems. Holling and Allen describe an approach called adaptive inference which sorts and sifts among multiple overlapping and not entirely separable causes of structure in ecosystems. Critical for support of the textural discontinuity hypothesis is the identification of the mechanisms that generate such discontinuities. Peterson uses spatial modeling of fire to explore how contagious disturbances may structure ecosystems across a broad range of scales. He demonstrates how the ecological memory of past fires influences the persistence of spatial structure at different scales. He shows that spatial pattern can be produced by simple interactions between contagious disturbance processes and vegetative dynamics if the landscape holds a memory of past fires. Ecological processes that are strongly remembered by an ecosystem have the potential to become keystone processes that generate ecological structure at specific scales and thus have the potential to entrain other processes and ecological attributes such as body size patterns. Forys and Allen explore the consequences of species turnover on the body mass pattern and within and across scale distribution of functional groups for the vertebrates of the Everglades ecosystem. They show that despite a large turnover in species composition resulting from species invasions and extinctions overall body mass patterns do not change substantially; moreover the richness and distribution of functional groups both within and across scales do not change (although functional group representation does change). Their analysis provides compelling evidence of the robustness and persistence of the patterns detected suggesting strong self organization and resilience in the Everglades system despite enormous perturbations. Allen and Saunders extend the earlier findings of Allen and others that first suggested that the discontinuities in animal body mass distributions represent scale breaks. They examine the phenomenon of nomadism in birds in an Australian Mediterranean climate ecosystem and find that nomadic birds also cluster about scale breaks (that is they occur at the edge of body mass aggregations). The clustering of these phenomena at predictable scale breaks suggests that variability in resource distribution or availability is greatest at these states. Location at scale breaks affords species great opportunity but also a potential for crisis. Complex behaviors such as nomadism may evolve most efficiently and commonly at scale breaks where there is the greatest potential reward albeit with the highest potential cost. Bessey extends the discovery of discontinuities and departures from scaling laws to city size distributions. He suggests that the landscape of social structures categorized as cities is scale dependent and that inferences about city size distribution may be misleading if made at inappropriate scales. City systems reflect humans adaptation to their environment. Besseys analysis suggests that there are persistent deviations from scaling laws in citysize distributions analyzed at the appropriate scale and that these deviations reflect city function and evolution. Cross scale structure the partitioning of diversity within and across scales the importance of scale breaks and the phenomena associated with scale breaks are fruitful avenues of investigation in the analysis of ecological economic and social systems. If discontinuous distributions reflect underlying structure at different scales the analysis of changes in these distributions will be a powerful tool to assay changes in landscape structure and the processes responsible for maintaining them. It may provide a strong link between the often disparate fields of ecology and economics and a powerful synthetic tool that can be used to analyze complex systems such as ecological economic social systems and to offer insight into their generation and their resilience. 949:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nomadism in animals is a response to resource distributions that are highly variable in time and space. Using the avian fauna of the Mediterranean climate region of southcentral Australia we tested a number of variables to determine if they predicted nomadism. These variables were species body mass the distance in body mass terms to the edge of a body mass aggregation and diet (for example seeds invertebrates nectar or plants). We utilized two different classifications of the avifauna that diverged in their definition of nomadic to build two different predictive models. Using both classifications distance to the edge of a body mass aggregation was found to be a significant predictor of nomadism. There was also evidence that nomads tend to feed on nectar and tend to be large. The significance of the variables body mass and diet (nectar) may reflect the greater energy requirements of large birds and the inherent variability of nectar as a food source. The significance of the variable distance to the edge of a body mass aggregation provides further evidence of inherent variability in resources between domains of scale. The edges of body mass aggregations are hypothesized to be areas of increased resource variability that reflect the transition from one scale of landscape pattern to another. 1034:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The strength of carbon sink and stock was assessed in a protected savanna of the Orinoco Llanos by the harvesting plant phytomass and using allometric relationships between the dry mass and the censuses of plant height. Thus changes in the carbon stock and the proportion in the tree grass proportion were evaluated throughout age states. Results indicate that the carbon stock in the vegetation increased from 207 to 9215 g C m( 2) whereas in the soil it varied 6680 to 12196 g C m( 2) The carbon stock accumulation was mainly related to increases in the woody layer from 36 to 9215 g C m( 2) (255 fold) and in the soil from 1341 to 12196 g C m( 2) (nine fold) respectively. The estimated pool of carbon sequestered in the Orinoco Llanos by the restored forest in 51 years was 5.69 Pg C. The expansion and conservation of this carbon pool might remove CO from the atmosphere to help compensate for CO liberation associated with other land uses or industrial practices. 1053:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Changes to the global nitrogen cycle affect human health well beyond the associated benefits of increased food production. Many intensively fertilized crops become animal feed helping to create disparities in world food distribution and leading to unbalanced diets even in wealthy nations. Excessive air and water borne nitrogen are linked to respiratory ailments cardiac disease and several cancers. Ecological feedbacks to excess nitrogen can inhibit crop growth increase allergenic pollen production and potentially affect the dynamics of several vector borne diseases including West Nile virus malaria and cholera. These and other examples suggest that our increasing production and use of fixed nitrogen poses a growing public health risk. 1074:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tropical ecosystems dominate the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere yet our understanding of how nutrients control the tropical carbon (C) cycle remains far from complete. In part this knowledge gap arises from the marked complexity of the tropical forest biome in which nitrogen phosphorus and perhaps several other elements may play roles in determining rates of C gain and loss. As studies from other ecosystems show failing to account for nutrient C interactions can lead to substantial errors in predicting how ecosystems will respond to climate and other environmental changes. Thus although resolving the complex nature of tropical forest nutrient limitation and then incorporating such knowledge into predictive models will be difficult it is a challenge that the global change community must address. 1082:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a model that yields ecosystem level predictions of the flux storage and turnover of carbon in three important pools (autotrophs decomposers labile soil C) based on the constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate. The model predicts a 10 000 fold increase in C turnover rates moving from tree to phytoplankton dominated ecosystems due to the size dependence of photosynthetic rates. The model predicts a 16 fold increase in rates controlled by respiration  decomposition turnover of labile soil C and microbial biomass) over the temperature range 0 30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of ATP synthesis in respiratory complexes. The model predicts only a fourfold increase in rates controlled by photosynthesis  net primary production litter fall fine root turnover) over the temperature range 0 30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of Rubisco carboxylation in chloroplasts. The difference between the temperature dependence of respiration and photosynthesis yields quantitative predictions for distinct phenomena that include acclimation of plant respiration geographic gradients in labile C storage and differences between the short and long term temperature dependence of whole ecosystem CO2 flux. These four sets of model predictions were tested using global compilations of data on C flux storage and turnover in ecosystems. Results support the hypothesis that the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate impose important constraints on the global C cycle. The model thus provides a synthetic mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular individual and community level processes. 1087:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The presence and activity of individual plants can affect soil resource availability and microbial processes and can influence the spatial scale over which soil properties vary. While soils have been found to differ under plants of differing growth form  grasses vs. trees) few studies have focused on small scale soil differences under comparably sized species. Here we investigate how two types of C 3 grasses influence patterns in soil properties and processes at scales of less than one meter in a California grassland. To understand how native perennial grasses differ from invasive annual grasses in their effects on soils we used cross semivariogram analysis to quantify the degree and scale of spatial heterogeneity in soil properties and processes in experimentally seeded grasslands. We then used mapping techniques to correlate spatial patterns of soil properties and processes with the cover of annual and perennial grasses aboveground. We found that many soil properties and processes belowground were spatially correlated with the aboveground presence of annuals or perennials. Soil moisture became more heterogeneous with increasing amounts of perennial cover suggesting that perennial bunchgrass individuals take up more water and produce zones of resource depletion in comparison with soils directly under annual grasses. The association of belowground resources and activity with the two types of grass suggests that the historical shift from perennial to annual dominance in California grasslands led to changes in the small scale spatial structure of soil properties and processes in these systems. These changes may alter ecosystem function and could potentially perpetuate invasive annual grass dominance. 1088:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sediment transport through the Brazilian sector of the Amazon River valley a distance of 2010 km involves exchanges between the channel and the flood plain that in each direction exceed the annual nw of sediment out of the river at Obidos (similar to 1200 Mt yr( 1)). The exchanges occur through bans: erosion bar deposition settling from diffuse overbank flow and sedimentation in flood plain channels. We estimated the magnitude of these exchanges for each of 10 reaches of the valley and combined them with calculations of sediment transport into and out of the reaches based on sediment sampling and now records to define a sediment budget for each reach Residuals in the sediment budget of a reach include errors of estimation and erosion or deposition within the channel. The annual supply of sediment entering the channel from bank erosion was estimated to average 1570 Mt yr( 1) (1.3 x the Obidos flux) and the amount transferred from channel transport to the bars (380 Mt yr( 1)) and the flood plain (460 Mt yr( 1) in channelized flow; 1230 Mt yr( 1) in diffuse overbank now) totaled 2070 Mt yr( 1) (1.7 x the Obidos flux). Thus deposition on the bars and flood plain exceeded bank erosion by 500 Mt yr( 1) over a 10 16 yr period. Sampling and calculation of sediment loads in the channel indicate a net accumulation in the valley floor of approximately 200 Mt yr( 1) over 16 yr crudely validating the process based calculations of the sediment budget which in turn illuminate the physical controls on each exchange process Another 300 400 Mt yr( 1) are deposited in a delta plain downstream of Obidos The components of the sediment budget reflect hydrologic characteristics of the valley floor and geomorphic characteristics of the channel and flood plain which In turn are influenced by tectonic features of the Amazon structural trough. 1096:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Lake sediments are   hot spots of methane production in the landscape. However regional and global lake methane emissions contributing to the greenhouse effect are poorly known. We developed predictions of methane emissions from easily measured lake characteristics based on measurements for 11 North American and 13 Swedish lakes and literature values from 49 lakes. Results suggest that open water methane emission can be predicted from variables such as lake area water depth concentrations of total phosphorus dissolved organic carbon and methane and the anoxic lake volume fraction. Using these relations we provide regional estimates from lakes in Sweden and the upper midwest of the United States. Considering both open water and plant mediated fluxes we estimate global emissions as 8 48 Tg CH4 yr( 1) (6 16 PeRcEnT of total natural methane emissions and greater than oceanic emission) indicating that lakes should be included as a significant source in global methane budgets. 1097:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A growing body of evidence suggests that most of the worlds lakes are supersaturated with CO2 and export significant amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. Still the temperature dependence of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in lakes which is the main driver of carbon flux across the air water interface has not yet been assessed. Analyzing a global scale database of 4902 lakes we show that temperature is not an important regulator of pCO(2) in lakes. Instead the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) a substrate for microbial respiration explains significant variation in lake pCO(2). Contrary to what may be expected from the physiological constraints of temperature effects of climate change on the carbon balance of lakes may not be due to rising temperature per se but rather to climatically induced changes in the export of DOC from terrestrial soils to aquatic habitats. 1098:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions are important but poorly quantified components of riverine carbon (C) budgets. This is largely because the data needed for gas flux calculations are sparse and are spatially and temporally variable. Additionally the importance of C gas emissions relative to lateral C exports is not well known because gaseous and aqueous fluxes are not commonly measured on the same rivers. We couple measurements of aqueous CO2 and CH4 partial pressures (pCO(2) pCH(4)) and flux across the water air interface with gas transfer models to calculate subbasin distributions of gas flux density. We then combine those flux densities with remote and direct observations of stream and river water surface area and ice duration to calculate C gas emissions from flowing waters throughout the Yukon River basin. CO2 emissions were 7.68 Tg C yr( 1) (95 PeRcEnT CI: 5.84 10.46) averaging 750 g C m( 2) yr( 1) normalized to water surface area and 9.0 g C m( 2) yr( 1) normalized to river basin area. River CH4 emissions totaled 55 Gg C yr( 1) or 0.7 PeRcEnT of the total mass of C emitted as CO2 plus CH4 and similar to 6.4 PeRcEnT of their combined radiative forcing. When combined with lateral inorganic plus organic C exports to below head of tide C gas emissions comprised 50 PeRcEnT of total C exported by the Yukon River and its tributaries. River CO2 and CH4 derive from multiple sources including groundwater surface water runoff carbonate equilibrium reactions and benthic and water column microbial processing of organic C. The exact role of each of these processes is not yet quantified in the overall river C budget. 1099:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fluxes of methane from field observations of native and cropped grassland soils in Colorado and Nebraska were used to model CH(4) oxidation as a function of soil water content temperature porosity and field capacity (FC). A beta function is used to characterize the effect of soil water on the physical limitation of gas diffusivity when water is high and biological limitation when water is low. Optimum soil volumetric water content (W(opt)) increases with FC. The site specific maximum CH(4) oxidation rate (CH(4max)) varies directly with soil gas diffusivity (D) as a function of soil bulk density and FC. Although soil water content and physical pro are the primary controls on CH(4) uptake the potential for soil temperature to affect CH(4) uptake rates increases as soils become less limited by gas diffusivity. Daily CH(4) oxidation rate is calculated as the product of CH(4max) the normalized (0 100 PeRcEnT) beta function to account for water effects a temperature multiplier and an adjustment factor to account for the effects of agriculture on methane flux. The model developed with grassland soils also worked well in coniferous and tropical forest soils. However soil gas diffusivity as a function of field capacity and bulk density did not reliably predict maximum CH(4) oxidation rates in deciduous forest soils so a submodel for these systems was developed assuming that CH(4max) is a function of mineral soil bulk density. The overall model performed well with the data used for model development (r(2) equals 0.76) and with independent data from grasslands cultivated lands and coniferous deciduous and tropical forests (r(2) equals 0.73 mean error   6 PeRcEnT). 10:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1101:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Northern high latitude rivers transport large amounts of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) from boreal and arctic ecosystems to coastal areas and oceans. Current knowledge of the biodegradability of DOM in these rivers is limited particularly for large rivers discharging to the Arctic Ocean. We conducted a seasonally comprehensive study of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) dynamics in the Yukon River and two of its tributaries in Alaska USA. Distinct seasonal patterns of BDOC consistent across a wide range of watershed size indicate BDOC is transported year round. Relative biodegradability (PeRcEnT BDOC) was greatest during winter and decreased into spring and summer. Due to large seasonal differences in DOC concentration the greatest concentrations of BDOC (mg C L 1) occurred during spring freshet followed by winter and summer. While chemical composition of DOM was an important driver of BDOC the overriding control of BDOC was mineral nutrient availability due to wide shifts in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stoichiometry across seasons. We calculated seasonal and annual loads of BDOC exported by the Yukon River by applying measured BDOC concentrations to daily water discharge values and also by applying an empirical correlation between PeRcEnT BDOC and the ratio of DOC to dissolved inorganic N (DIN) to total DOC loads. The Yukon River exports similar to 0.2 Tg C yr( 1) as BDOC that is decomposable within 28 days. This corresponds to 12 18 PeRcEnT of the total annual DOC export. Furthermore we calculate that the six largest arctic rivers including the Yukon River collectively export similar to 2.3 Tg C yr( 1) as BDOC to the Arctic Ocean. 1102:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Observations of N gas loss from incubations of intact and disturbed soil cores were used to model N(2)O and N(2) emissions from soil as a result of denitrification. The model assumes that denitrification rates are controlled by the availability in soil of NO(3) (e( ) acceptor) labile C compounds (e( ) donor) and O(2) (competing e( ) acceptor). Heterotrophic soil respiration is used as a proxy for labile C availability while O(2) availability is a function of soil physical properties that influence gas diffusivity soil WFPS and O(2) demand. The potential for O(2) demand as indicated by respiration rates to contribute to soil anoxia varies inversely with a soil gas diffusivity coefficient which is regulated by soil porosity and pore size distribution. Model inputs include soil heterotrophic respiration rate texture NO(3) concentration and WFPS. The model selects the minimum of the NO(3) and CO(2) functions to establish a maximum potential denitrification rate for particular levels of e( ) acceptor and C substrate and accounts for limitation of O(2) availability to estimate daily N(2) N(2)O flux rates. The ratio of soil NO(3) concentration to CO(2) emission was found to reliably (r(2) 0.5) model the ratio of N(2) to N(2)O gases emitted from the intact cores after accounting for differences in gas diffusivity among the soils. The output of the ratio function is combined with the estimate of total N gas flux rate to infer N(2)O emission. The model performed well when comparing observed and simulated values of N(2)O flux rates with the data used for model building (r(2) 0.50) and when comparing observed and simulated N(2)O N(2) gas emission rates from irrigated field soils used for model testing (r(2) 0.47). 1103:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database was developed in order to determine carbon pools in soils of the northern circumpolar permafrost region. The area of all soils in the northern permafrost region is approximately 18 782 x 10(3) km(2) or approximately 16 PeRcEnT of the global soil area. In the northern permafrost region organic soils (peatlands) and cryoturbated permafrost affected mineral soils have the highest mean soil organic carbon contents (32.2 69.6 kg m( 2)). Here we report a new estimate of the carbon pools in soils of the northern permafrost region including deeper layers and pools not accounted for in previous analyses. Carbon pools were estimated to be 191.29 Pg for the 0 30 cm depth 495.80 Pg for the 0 100 cm depth and 1024.00 Pg for the 0 300 cm depth. Our estimate for the first meter of soil alone is about double that reported for this region in previous analyses. Carbon pools in layers deeper than 300 cm were estimated to be 407 Pg in yedoma deposits and 241 Pg in deltaic deposits. In total the northern permafrost region contains approximately 1672 Pg of organic carbon of which approximately 1466 Pg or 88 PeRcEnT occurs in perennially frozen soils and deposits. This 1672 Pg of organic carbon would account for approximately 50 PeRcEnT of the estimated global belowground organic carbon pool. 1104:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We estimated organic carbon (OC) burial over the past century in 40 impoundments in one of the most intensively agricultural regions of the world. The volume of sediment deposited per unit time varied as a function of lake and watershed size but smaller impoundments had greater deposition and accumulation rates per unit area. Annual water storage losses varied from 0.1 20 PeRcEnT and were negatively correlated with impoundment size. Estimated sediment OC content was greatest in lakes with low ratios of watershed to impoundment area. Sediment OC burial rates were higher than those assumed for fertile impoundments by previous studies and were much higher than those measured in natural lakes. OC burial ranged from a high of 17 000 g Cm( 2) a( 1) to a low of 148 g Cm( 2) a( 1) and was significantly greater in small impoundments than large ones. The OC buried in these lakes originates in both autochthonous and allochthonous production. These analyses suggest that OC sequestration in moderate to large impoundments may be double the rate assumed in previous analyses. Extrapolation suggests that they may bury 4 times as much carbon (C) as the worlds oceans. The worlds farm ponds alone may bury more OC than the oceans and 33 PeRcEnT as much as the worlds rivers deliver to the sea. 1105:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A model developed by the authors (Huang . 1998) was further validated against field measurements from various regions of the world and calibrated to estimate methane emission from irrigated rice cultivation of China. On the basis of available information on rice cultivated area growth duration grain yield soil texture and temperature methane emission from Chinese rice paddies was estimated for 28 rice cultivated provinces in mainland. The calculated daily methane emission rates on a provincial scale ranged from 0.15 to 0.86 g m( 2) with an average of 0.32 g m( 2). Five of the top six locations with higher daily methane emissions are located at a latitude between 28 degrees and 31 degrees N. A total amount of 9.66 Tg (1 Tg equals 10(12) g) CH(4) per year ranging from 7.19 to 13.62 was estimated to be released from Chinese rice paddy soils. Of the total 45 PeRcEnT is emitted from the single rice growing season and 19 PeRcEnT and 36 PeRcEnT are from the early rice and the late rice growing seasons respectively. Approximately 70 PeRcEnT of the total is emitted in the region located at latitude between 25 degrees and 32 degrees N. The emissions from rice fields in Sichuan and Hunan Province were calculated to be 2.85 Tg y( 1) accounting for approximate to 30 PeRcEnT of the total. Comparisons of the estimated and the observed emission rates show that the estimates were in general close to the measurements at most locations. 1107:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As atmospheric CO(2) increases ecosystem carbon sequestration will largely depend on how global changes in climate will alter the balance between net primary production and decomposition. The response of primary production to climatic change has been examined using well validated mechanistic models but the same is not true for decomposition a primary source of atmospheric CO(2). We used the Long term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET) dataset and model selection techniques to choose and parameterize a model that describes global patterns of litter decomposition. Mass loss was best represented by a three pool negative exponential model with a rapidly decomposing labile pool an intermediate pool representing cellulose and a recalcitrant pool. The initial litter lignin nitrogen ratio defined the size of labile and intermediate pools. Lignin content determined the size of the recalcitrant pool. The decomposition rate of all pools was modified by climate but the intermediate pools decomposition rate was also controlled by relative amounts of litter cellulose and lignin (indicative of lignin encrusted cellulose). The effect of climate on decomposition was best represented by a composite variable that multiplied a water stress function by the Lloyd and Taylor variable Q(10) temperature function. Although our model explained nearly 70 PeRcEnT of the variation in LIDET data we observed systematic deviations from model predictions. Below and aboveground material decomposed at notably different rates depending on the decomposition stage. Decomposition in certain ecosystem specific environmental conditions was not well represented by our model; this included roots in very wet and cold soils and aboveground litter in N rich and arid sites. Despite these limitations our model may still be extremely useful for global modeling efforts because it accurately (R(2) 0.6804) described general patterns of long term global decomposition for a wide array of litter types using relatively minimal climatic and litter quality data. 1114:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Decomposition is a critical process in global carbon cycling. During decomposition leaf and fine root litter may undergo a later relatively slow phase; past long term experiments indicate this phase occurs but whether it is a general phenomenon has not been examined. Data from Long term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team representing 27 sites and nine litter types (for a total of 234 cases) was used to test the frequency of this later slow phase of decomposition. Litter mass remaining after up to 10 years of decomposition was fit to models that included (dual exponential and asymptotic) or excluded (single exponential) a slow phase. The resultant regression equations were evaluated for goodness of fit as well as biological realism. Regression analysis indicated that while the dual exponential and asymptotic models statistically and biologically fit more of the litter type site combinations than the single exponential model the latter was biologically reasonable for 27 65 PeRcEnT of the cases depending on the test used. This implies that a slow phase is common but not universal. Moreover estimates of the decomposition rate of the slowly decomposing component averaged 0.139 0.221 year( 1) (depending on method) higher than generally observed for mineral soil organic matter but one third of the faster phase of litter decomposition. Thus this material may be slower than the earlier phases of litter decomposition but not as slow as mineral soil organic matter. Comparison of the long term integrated decomposition rate (which included all phases of decomposition) to that for the first year of decomposition indicated the former was on average 75 PeRcEnT that of the latter consistent with the presence of a slow phase of decomposition. These results indicate that the global store of litter estimated using short term decomposition rates would be underestimated by at least one third. 1115:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the importance of Arctic and boreal regions in the present carbon cycle estimates of annual high latitude carbon fluxes vary in sign and magnitude. Without accurate estimates of current carbon fluxes from Arctic and boreal ecosystems predicting the response of these systems to global change is daunting. A number of factors control carbon turnover in high latitude soils but because they are unique to northern systems they are mostly ignored by biogeochemical models used to predict the response of these systems to global change. Here we review those factors. First many northern systems are dominated by mosses whose extremely slow decomposition is not predicted by commonly used indices of litter quality. Second cold temperature permafrost waterlogging and substrate quality interact to stabilize soil organic matter but the relative importance of these factors and how they respond to climate change is unknown. Third recent evidence suggests that biological activity occurring over winter can contribute significantly to annual soil carbon fluxes. However the controls over this winter activity remain poorly understood. Finally processes at the landscape stale such as fire permafrost dynamics and drainage control regional carbon fluxes complicating the extrapolation of site level measurements to regional scales. 1120:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is not clear whether the consistent positive effect of elevated CO2 on soil respiration (soil carbon flux SCF) results from increased plant and microbial activity due to (i) greater C availability through CO2 induced increases in C inputs or (ii) enhanced soil moisture via CO2 induced declines in stomatal conductance and plant water use. Global changes such as biodiversity loss or nitrogen (N) deposition may also affect these drivers interacting with CO2 to affect SCF. To determine the effects of these factors on SCF and elucidate the mechanism(s) behind the effect of elevated CO2 on SCF we measured SCF and soil moisture throughout a growing season in the Biodiversity CO2 and N (BioCON) experiment. Increasing diversity and N caused small declines in soil moisture. Diversity had inconsistent small effects on SCF through its effects on abiotic conditions while N had a small positive effect that was unrelated to soil moisture. Elevated CO2 had large consistent effects increasing soil moisture by 26 PeRcEnT and SCF by 45 PeRcEnT. However CO2 induced changes in soil moisture were weak drivers of SCF: CO2 effects on SCF and soil moisture were uncorrelated CO2 effect size did not change with soil moisture within day CO2 effects via soil moisture were neutral or weakly negative and the estimated effect of increased C availability was 14 times larger than that of increased soil moisture. Combined with previous BioCON results indicating elevated CO2 increases C availability to plants and microbes our results suggest that increased SCF is driven by CO2 induced increases in substrate availability. Our results provide further support for increased rates of belowground C cycling at elevated CO2 and evidence that unlike the response of productivity to elevated CO2 in BioCON the response of SCF is not strongly N limited. Thus N limited grasslands are unlikely to act as a N sink under elevated CO2. 1122:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Litter decomposition represents one of the largest annual fluxes of carbon (C) from terrestrial ecosystems particularly for tropical forests which are generally characterized by high net primary productivity and litter turnover. We used data from the Long Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment (LIDET) to (1) determine the relative importance of climate and litter quality as predictors of decomposition rates (2) compare patterns in root and leaf litter decomposition (3) identify controls on net nitrogen (N) release during decay and (4) compare LIDET rates with native species studies across five bioclimatically diverse neotropical forests. Leaf and root litter decomposed fastest in the lower montane rain and moist forests and slowest in the seasonally dry forest. The single best predictor of leaf litter decomposition was the climate decomposition index (CDI) explaining 51 PeRcEnT of the variability across all sites. The strongest models for predicting leaf decomposition combined climate and litter chemistry and included CDI and lignin (R(2) 0.69) or CDI N and nonpolar extractives (R(2) 0.69). While we found no significant differences in decomposition rates between leaf and root litter drivers of decomposition differed for the two tissue types. Initial stages of decomposition determined as the time to 50 PeRcEnT mass remaining were driven primarily by precipitation for leaf litter (R(2) 0.93) and by temperature for root litter (R(2) 0.86). The rate of N release from leaf litter was positively correlated with initial N concentrations; net N immobilization increased with decreasing initial N concentrations. This study demonstrates that decomposition is sensitive to climate within and across tropical forests. Our results suggest that climate change and increasing N deposition in tropical forests are likely to result in significant changes to decomposition rates in this biome. 1125:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Net CO2 flux measurements conducted during the summer and winter of 1994 96 were scaled in space and time to provide estimates of net CO2 exchange during the 1995 96 (9 May 1995 8 May 1996) annual cycle for the Kuparuk River Basin a 9200 km(2) watershed located in NE Alaska. Net CO2 flux was measured using dynamic chambers and eddy covariance in moist acidic nonacidic wet sedge and shrub tundra which comprise 95 PeRcEnT of the terrestrial landscape of the Kuparuk Basin. CO2 flux data were used as input to multivariate models that calculated instantaneous and daily rates of gross primary production (GPP) and whole ecosystem respiration (R) as a function of meteorology and ecosystem development. Net CO2 flux was scaled up to the Kuparuk Basin using a geographical information system (GIS) consisting of a vegetation map digital terrain map dynamic temperature and radiation fields and the models of GPP and R. Basin wide estimates of net CO2 exchange for the summer growing season (9 May 5 September 1995) indicate that nonacidic tundra was a net sink of 31.7 21.3 GgC (1 Gg equals 10(9) g) while shrub tundra lost 32.5 6.3 GgC to the atmosphere (negative values denote net ecosystem CO2 uptake). Acidic and wet sedge tundra were in balance and when integrated for the entire Kuparuk River Basin (including aquatic surfaces) whole basin summer net CO2 exchange was estimated to be in balance ( 0.9 50.3 GgC). Autumn to winter (6 September 1995 8 May 1996) estimates of net CO2 flux indicate that acidic nonacidic and shrub tundra landforms were all large sources of CO2 to the atmosphere (75.5 8.3 96.4 11.4 and 43.3 4.7 GgC for acidic nonacidic and shrub tundra respectively). CO2 loss from wet sedge surfaces was not substantially different from zero but the large losses from the other terrestrial landforms resulted in a whole basin net CO2 loss of 217.2 24.1 GgC during the 1995 96 cold season. When integrated for the 1995 96 annual cycle acidic (66.4 25.25 GgC) nonacidic (64.7 29.2 GgC) and shrub tundra (75.8 8.4 GgC) were substantial net sources of COP to the atmosphere while wet sedge tundra was in balance (0.4 0.8 GgC). The Kuparuk River Basin as a whole was estimated to be a net CO2 source of 218.1 60.6 GgC over the 1995 96 annual cycle. Compared to direct measurements of regional net COP flux obtained from aircraft based eddy covariance the scaling procedure provided realistic estimates of CO2 exchange during the summer growing season. Although winter estimates could not be assessed directly using aircraft measurements of net COP exchange the estimates reported here are comparable to measured values reported in the literature. Thus we have high confidence in the summer estimates of net CO2 exchange and reasonable confidence in the winter net CO2 flux estimates terrestrial landforms of the Kuparuk river basin. Although there is larger uncertainty in the aquatic estimates the small surface area of aquatic surfaces in the Kuparuk river basin (approximate to5 PeRcEnT) presumably reduces the potential for this uncertainty to result in large errors in basin wide CO2 flux estimates. 1127:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One of the major concerns about global warming is the potential for an increase in decomposition and soil respiration rates increasing CO(2) emissions and creating a positive feedback between global warming and soil respiration. This is particularly important in ecosystems with large belowground biomass such as grasslands where over 90 PeRcEnT of the carbon is allocated belowground. A better understanding of the relative influence of climate and litter quality on litter decomposition is needed to predict these changes accurately in grasslands. The Long Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET) dataset was used to evaluate the influence of climatic variables (temperature precipitation actual evapotranspiration and climate decomposition index) and litter quality (lignin content carbon : nitrogen and lignin : nitrogen ratios) on leaf and root decomposition in the US Great Plains. Wooden dowels were used to provide a homogeneous litter quality to evaluate the relative importance of above and belowground environments on decomposition. Contrary to expectations temperature did not explain variation in root and leaf decomposition whereas precipitation partially explained variation in root decomposition. Percent lignin was the best predictor of leaf and root decomposition. It also explained most variation in root decomposition in models which combined litter quality and climatic variables. Despite the lack of relationship between temperature and root decomposition temperature could indirectly affect root decomposition through decreased litter quality and increased water deficits. These results suggest that carbon flux from root decomposition in grasslands would increase as result of increasing temperature only if precipitation is not limiting. However where precipitation is limiting increased temperature would decrease root decomposition thus likely increasing carbon storage in grasslands. Under homogeneous litter quality belowground decomposition was faster than aboveground and was best predicted by mean annual precipitation which also suggests that the high moisture in soil accelerates decomposition belowground. 1128:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predicted responses of transpiration to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) are highly variable amongst process based models. To better understand and constrain this variability amongst models we conducted an intercomparison of 11 ecosystem models applied to data from two forest free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments at Duke University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We analysed model structures to identify the key underlying assumptions causing differences in model predictions of transpiration and canopy water use efficiency. We then compared the models against data to identify model assumptions that are incorrect or are large sources of uncertainty. We found that model to model and model to observations differences resulted from four key sets of assumptions namely (i) the nature of the stomatal response to elevated CO2 (coupling between photosynthesis and stomata was supported by the data); (ii) the roles of the leaf and atmospheric boundary layer (models which assumed multiple conductance terms in series predicted more decoupled fluxes than observed at the broadleaf site); (iii) the treatment of canopy interception (large intermodel variability 215 PeRcEnT); and (iv) the impact of soil moisture stress (process uncertainty in how models limit carbon and water fluxes during moisture stress). Overall model predictions of the CO2 effect on WUE were reasonable (intermodel approximately 28 PeRcEnT 10 PeRcEnT) compared to the observations ( approximately 30 PeRcEnT 13 PeRcEnT) at the well coupled coniferous site (Duke) but poor (intermodel approximately 24 PeRcEnT 6%; observations approximately 38 PeRcEnT 7 PeRcEnT) at the broadleaf site (Oak Ridge). The study yields a framework for analysing and interpreting model predictions of transpiration responses to eCO2 and highlights key improvements to these types of models. 1135:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To reconcile observations of decomposition rates carbon inventories and net primary production (NPP) we estimated long term averages for C exchange in boreal forests near Thompson Manitoba. Soil drainage as defined by water table moss cover and permafrost dynamics is the dominant control on direct fire emissions. In upland forests an average of about 10 30 PeRcEnT of annual NPP was likely consumed by fire over the past 6500 years since these landforms and ecosystems were established. This longterm average fire emission is much larger than has been accounted for in global C cycle models and may forecast an increase in fire activity for this region. While over decadal to century times these boreal forests may be acting as slight net sinks for C from the atmosphere to land periods of drought and severe fire activity may result in net sources of C from these systems. 1139:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We analyzed results from 10 year long field incubations of foliar and fine root litter from the Long term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET) study. We tested whether a variety of climate and litter quality variables could be used to develop regression models of decomposition parameters across wide ranges in litter quality and climate and whether these models changed over short to long time periods. Six genera of foliar and three genera of root litters were studied with a 10 fold range in the ratio of acid unhydrolyzable fraction (AUF or lignin) to N. Litter was incubated at 27 field sites across numerous terrestrial biomes including arctic and alpine tundra temperate and tropical forests grasslands and warm deserts. We used three separate mathematical models of first order (exponential) decomposition emphasizing either the first year or the entire decade. One model included the proportion of relatively stable material as an asymptote. For short term (first year) decomposition nonlinear regressions of exponential or power function form were obtained with r2 values of 0.82 and 0.64 for foliar and fine root litter respectively across all biomes included. AUF and AUF : N ratio were the most explanative litter quality variables while the combined temperature moisture terms AET (actual evapotranspiration) and CDI (climatic decomposition index) were best for climatic effects. Regressions contained some systematic bias for grasslands and arctic and boreal sites but not for humid tropical forests or temperate deciduous and coniferous forests. The ability of the regression approach to fit climate driven decomposition models of the 10 year field results was dramatically reduced from the ability to capture drivers of short term decomposition. Future work will require conceptual and methodological improvements to investigate processes controlling decadal scale litter decomposition including the formation of a relatively stable fraction and its subsequent decomposition. 1141:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We assessed the potential impact of global warming resulting from a doubling of preindustrial atmospheric CO2 on soil net N transformations by transferring intact soil cores (0 15 cm) from a high elevation old growth forest to a forest about 800 m lower in elevation in the central Oregon Cascade Mountains USA. The lower elevation site had mean annual air and soil (10 cm mineral soil depth) temperatures about 2.4 and 3.9 degrees C higher than the high elevation site respectively. Annual rates of soil net N mineralization and nitrification more than doubled in soil transferred to the low elevation site (17.2 36.0 kg N ha( 1) and 5.0 10.7 kg NO3 N ha( 1) respectively). Leaching of inorganic N from the surface soil tin the absence of plant uptake) also increased. The reciprocal treatment (transferring soil cores from the low to the high elevation site) resulted in decreases of about 70 80 and 65 PeRcEnT in annual rates of net N mineralization nitrification and inorganic N leaching respectively. Laboratory incubations of soils under conditions of similar temperature and soil water potential suggest that the quality of soil organic matter is higher at the high elevation site. Similar in situ rates of soil net N transformations between the two sites occurred because the lower temperature counteracts the effects of greater substrate quantity and quality at the high elevation site. Our results support the hypothesis that high elevation old growth forest soils in the central Cascades have higher C and N storage than their low elevation analogues primarily because low temperatures limit net C and N mineralization rates at higher elevations. 1142:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We show that sediment respiration is one of the key factors contributing to the high CO2 supersaturation in and evasion from Finnish lakes and evidently also over large areas in the boreal landscape where the majority of the lakes are small and shallow. A subpopulation of 177 randomly selected lakes (  100 km(2)) and 32 lakes with the highest total phosphorus (P tot) concentrations in the Nordic Lake Survey (NLS) data base were sampled during four seasons and at four depths. Patterns of CO2 concentrations plotted against depth and time demonstrate strong CO2 accumulation in hypolimnetic waters during the stratification periods. The relationship between O 2 departure from the saturation and CO2 departure from the saturation was strong in the entire data set (r(2) 0.79 n 2 740 P   0.0001). CO2 concentrations were positively associated with lake trophic state and the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment. In contrast CO2 concentrations negatively correlated with the peatland percentage indicating that either input of easily degraded organic matter and or nutrient load from agricultural land enhance degradation. The average lake area weighted annual CO2 evasion based on our 177 randomly selected lakes and all Finnish lakes   100 km(2) (Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005) was 42 g C m( 2) LA (lake area) approximately 20 PeRcEnT of the average annual C accumulation in Finnish forest soils and tree biomass (covering 51 PeRcEnT of the total area of Finland) in the 1990s. Extrapolating our estimate from Finland to all lakes of the boreal region suggests a total annual CO2 evasion of about 50 TgC a value upto 40 PeRcEnT of current estimates for lakes of the entire globe emphasizing the role of small boreal lakes as conduits for transferring terrestrially fixed C into the atmosphere. 1163:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper aims to advance two objectives: (1) identify and explore greenhouse gas emissions from urban areas in Asia at the regional level; and (2) explore covariates of urban greenhouse gas emissions. We use the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research estimates for carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and sulfur hexafluoride from 14 source activities for the year 2000 which are allocated on a 1 10 degrees global grid. We extract emissions for 3535 urban extents all with populations over 50 000 accounting for approximately 91 PeRcEnT of the regions urban population. We use regression analysis to associate emissions with urban area and growth economic and biophysical characteristics. Our findings suggest that urban areas account for between 30 and 38 PeRcEnT of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions for the region and that emission per capita averages from urban areas are lower than those at the national level. Important covariates for total urban greenhouse gas emissions include population size density and growth rate income per capita development status and elevation. This is a first and preliminary assessment of regional baseline trends using these data and this top down analysis. . 1174:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In natural waters the uptake of transition metals such as copper (Cu) by aquatic biota depends on the activity of the free cupric ion ( Cu2 ) rather than on total Cu concentration. Thus an important ecological function of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems is Cu DOM complexation which greatly decreases the Cu2 . However Cu bioavailability is greatly modified by source and environmental history of DOM because DOM affinity for Cu varies by orders of magnitude among DOM sources; moreover DOM is photochemically unstable. During 72 h irradiation experiments at intensities approximating sunlight with DOM from a palustrine wetland and a third order river we investigated photooxidative effects on DOM complexation of Cu as well as spectral and chemical changes in DOM that might explain altered Cu complexation. Irradiation decreased Cu complexation by riverine DOM but unexpectedly increased Cu complexation by wetland DOM resulting in 150 PeRcEnT greater Cu2 in riverine DOM at the same dissolved organic carbon concentrations. The specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVa) and humic substances tracked photochemical changes in the conditional stability constants of Cu DOM complexes suggesting that the aromaticity of DOM influences its affinity for Cu. Carbonyl concentration in C 13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (C 13 NMR) covaried directly with Cu binding site densities in DOM. However no aspect of Cu DOM complexation consistently covaried with fluorophores  the fluorescence index) or low molecular weight organic acids. Our results suggest that global increases in UV radiation will affect Cu DOM complexation and subsequent Cu toxicity depending on light regime as well as DOM source. 1186:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Material exports by rivers particularly carbon exports provide insight to basin geology weathering and ecological processes within the basin. Accurate accounting of those exports is valuable to understanding present past and projected basin wide changes in those processes. We calculated lateral export of inorganic and organic carbon (IC and OC) from rivers draining the conterminous United States using stream gaging and water quality data from more than 100 rivers. Approximately 90 PeRcEnT of land area and 80 PeRcEnT of water export were included which enabled a continental scale estimate using minor extrapolation. Total carbon export was 41 49 Tg C yr( 1). IC was  75 PeRcEnT of export and exceeded OC export in every region except the southeastern Atlantic seaboard. The 10 largest rivers by discharge accounted for 66 PeRcEnT of water export and carried 74 and 62 PeRcEnT of IC and OC export respectively. Watershed carbon yield for the conterminous United States was 4.2 and 1.3 g C m( 2) yr( 1) for IC and OC respectively. The dominance of IC export was unexpected but is consistent with geologic models suggesting high weathering rates in the continental United States due to the prevalence of easily weathered sedimentary rock. 1187:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To better integrate lotic ecosystems into global cycles and budgets we provide approximations of the size distribution and areal extent of streams and rivers. One approach we used was to employ stream network theory combined with data on stream width. We also used detailed stream networks on 2 continents to estimate the fraction of continental area occupied by streams worldwide and corrected remote sensing stream inventories for unresolved small streams. Our estimates of global fluvial area are 485 000 to 662 000 km(2) and are 30 300 PeRcEnT of published appraisals. Moderately sized rivers (orders 5 9) seem to comprise the greatest global area with less area covered by low and high order streams while global stream length and therefore the riparian interface is dominated by 1st order streams. Rivers and streams are likely to cover 0.30 0.56 PeRcEnT of the land surface and make contributions to global processes and greenhouse gas emissions that may be 20 200 PeRcEnT greater than those implied by previous estimates. 1188:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding concentrations and contributions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in aquatic ecosystems is an important part of a comprehensive global carbon budget. Current dogma suggests that world lakes are important emitters of CO2 to the atmosphere. We estimated the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (rho CO2) in 131 agriculturally eutrophic lakes over a 7 year sampling period. Values of rho CO2 in these lakes ranged from 0.1 to 40 392 mu atm with a median of 322 mu atm (n equals 3049). In contrast to previous analyses of CO2 in lakes 60 PeRcEnT of the eutrophic lake samples were undersaturated with CO2. Correlation analysis implied that nutrient driven primary production reflected by high oxygen concentrations drives CO2 concentrations below atmospheric equilibrium. Multiple regression analysis showed several limno logical and catchment characteristics that explained a statistically significant amount of variability in rho CO2 (R 2 equals 0.32). Important variables included chlorophyll a concentration and the ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus. Our estimated rho CO2 values were significantly (p   0.0001) lower than a previously published dataset of world lake rho CO2 values derived primarily from oligotrophic mesotrophic lakes. High nutrient lakes especially those that are small and rich in oxygen from primary production could act as net atmospheric CO2 uptake sites. 11:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,124:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,126:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1288:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas second in importance to carbon dioxide (CO2). Biogenic sources account for 70 PeRcEnT of global emissions __ wetlands rice paddies livestock landfills forests oceans and termites. Natural wetlands and rice paddies are the largest CH4 sources and account for 20__60 PeRcEnT of the total natural and anthropogenic emissions. While the existing estimates of emissions from these known sources still have great uncertainty recent studies reveal a number of new sources contributing to the atmospheric CH4 burden. For example the bubble emissions due to thawing lake sediments from north Siberia alone were estimated to release 3.8 Tg CH4 yr1. Permafrost thawing also increases the CH4 emissions from wet soils. To adequately quantify total CH4 emissions and reconcile atmospheric CH4 concentrations with the earth surface emissions the mechanisms of and controls on these CH4 sources need to be further understood. The last synthesis effort of studying CH4 emissions focused on data compilation and data analysis at site levels. Our current synthesis continues the data compilation effort and incorporates new more sophisticated biogeochemistry and atmosphere transport models in quantifying regional and global CH4 emissions. Specifically recent CH4 studies have focused on the following areas: Understanding the processes and mechanisms of CH4 production and consumption in different environments through field observations environmental manipulations and using isotopic analyses; Measuring the emission fluxes from natural sources and observing atmospheric CH4 concentrations and profiles using flask measurements and satellite instruments; and Refining the estimates of CH4 emissions and their effect on the atmosphere with process based biogeochemistry models and atmospheric transport and inversion models. This section resulted from a project supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and presents results from new field studies new instruments and new approaches to the above areas. The section specifically addresses the issues of methane emissions in both natural and managed ecosystems which are undergoing anthropogenic and natural perturbations of water table permafrost thaw volcanic deposition sulfur deposition and manure fertilizer amendment. To better quantify the regional and global CH4 emissions these effects and controls need to be considered in biogeochemistry models. The continuous and long term observations of CH4 fluxes impacted by those factors and processes should still be a priority for the CH4 research community. 1289:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Growing season CH(4) fluxes were monitored over a two year period following the start of ecosystem scale manipulations of water table position and surface soil temperatures in a moderate rich fen in interior Alaska. The largest CH(4) fluxes occurred in plots that received both flooding (raised water table position) and soil warming while the lowest fluxes occurred in unwarmed plots in the lowered water table treatment. A combination of treatment and soil hydroclimate variables explained more than 70 PeRcEnT of the variation in lntransformed CH(4) fluxes with mean daily water table position representing the strongest predictor. We used quantitative PCR of the alpha subunit of mcr operon to explore the influence of soil climate manipulations on methanogen abundances. Methanogen abundances were greatest in warmed plots and showed a positive relationship with mean daily CH(4) fluxes. Our results show that water table manipulations that led to soil inundation (flooding) had a stronger effect on CH(4) fluxes than water table drawdown. Seasonal CH(4) fluxes increased by 80 300 PeRcEnT under the combined wetter and warmer soil climate treatments. Thus while warming is expected to increase CH(4) emissions from Alaskan wetlands higher water table positions caused by increases in precipitation or disturbances such as permafrost thaw that lead to thermokarst and flooding in wetlands will stimulate CH(4) emissions beyond the effects of soil warming alone. Consequently we argue that modeling the effects of climate change on Alaskan wetland CH(4) emissions needs to consider the interactive effects of soil warming and water table position on CH(4) production and transport. 1290:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper presents the characterization and validation of retrievals of atmospheric methane (CH(4)) vertical profiles by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS) on the EOS Aqua platform. AIRS channels near 7.6 mm are used for CH(4) retrieval and they are most sensitive to the middle to upper troposphere about 200 300 hPa in the tropics and 400 500 hPa in the polar region. The atmospheric temperature humidity profiles surface skin temperature and emissivity required to derive CH(4) are obtained from retrievals using separate AIRS channels and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU). Comparison of AIRS retrieved profiles with some in situ aircraft CH(4) profiles implied that the forward model used in the AIRS retrieval system V4.0 required a 2 PeRcEnT increase in methane absorption coefficients for strong absorption channels and this bias adjustment was implemented in the AIRS retrieval system V5.0. As a new operational product in V5.0 AIRS CH(4) were validated using in situ aircraft observations at 22 sites of the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory Global Monitoring Division (NOAA ESRL GMD) ranging from the Arctic to the tropical South Pacific Ocean but their altitudes are usually above 300 hPa. The results show the bias of the retrieved CH(4) profiles for this version is 1.4 similar to 0.1 PeRcEnT and its RMS difference is about 0.5 1.6 PeRcEnT depending on altitude. These validation comparisons provide critical assessment of the retrieval algorithm and will continue using more in situ observations together with future improvement to the retrieval algorithm. AIRS CH(4) products include not only the CH(4) profile but also the information content. As examples the products of AIRS CH(4) in August 2004 and the difference of CH(4) in May and September 2004 are shown. From these results a few features are evident: (1) a large AIRS CH(4) plume southwest of the Tibetan plateau that may be associated with deep convection during the Asian summer monsoon; (2) high mixing ratios of AIRS CH(4) in southeastern Asia and in the high northern hemisphere in the summer; and ( 3) the increase of AIRS CH(4) from May to September in the high northern hemisphere that is likely linked with wetland emission but needs more study. Further analysis of these data and its comparison with model data will be addressed in a separate paper. 1291:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This study reports an atmospheric methane ( CH4) source term previously uncharacterized regarding strength and isotopic composition. Methane emissions from 14 Siberian lakes and 9 Alaskan lakes were characterized using stable isotopes ( 13 C and D) and radiocarbon ( 14 C) analyses. We classified ebullition ( bubbling) into three categories ( background point sources and hot spots) on the basis of fluxes major gas concentrations and isotopic composition. Point sources and hot spots had a strong association with thermokarst ( thaw) erosion because permafrost degradation along lake margins releases ancient organic matter into anaerobic lake bottoms fueling methanogenesis. With increasing ebullition rate we observed increasing CH4 concentration of greater radiocarbon age depletion of 13 CCH4 and decreasing bubble N2 content. Microbial oxidation of methane was observed in bubbles that became trapped below and later within winter lake ice; however oxidation appeared insignificant in bubbles sampled immediately after release from sediments. Methanogenic pathways differed among the bubble sources: CO2 reduction supported point source and hot spot ebullition to a large degree while acetate fermentation appeared to contribute to background bubbling. To provide annual whole lake and regional CH4 isofluxes for the Siberian lakes we combined maps of bubble source distributions with long term continuous flux measurements and isotopic composition. In contrast to typical values used in inverse models of atmospheric CH4 for northern wetland sources ( d13 CCH4 equals 58 PeRcEnT 14 C age modern) which have not included northern lake ebullition as a source we show that this large new source of high latitude CH4 from lakes is isotopically distinct ( d13 CCH4 equals 70 PeRcEnT 14 C age 16 500 years for North Siberian lakes). 1292:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Boreal peatlands contain a large portion of the Earths terrestrial organic carbon and may be particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. Temperatures in boreal regions are predicted to increase during the twenty first century which may accelerate changes in soil microbial processes and plant community dynamics. In particular climate driven changes in plant community composition might affect the pathways and rates of methanogenesis the plant mediated emission of methane and the scavenging of methane by methanotrophic bacteria. Climate change may also affect methane cycling through changes in pore water chemistry. To date these feedbacks have not been incorporated into the carbon cycling components of climate models. We investigated the effects of soil warming and water table manipulations on methane cycling in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and fen received infrared warming treatments crossed with water table treatments for 6 years. In years 5 and 6 concentrations fluxes and isotopic compositions of methane were measured along with aboveground and belowground net primary productivity and pore water concentrations of acetate sulfate ammonium nitrate and dissolved organic carbon. Water table level was the dominant control over methane flux in the fen mesocosms likely through its effect on methane oxidation rates. However pore water chemistry and plant productivity were important secondary factors in explaining methane flux in the fen mesocosms and these factors appeared to be the predominant controls over methane flux in the bog mesocosms. The water table and IR treatments had large effects on pore water chemistry and plant productivity so the indirect effects of climate change appear to be just as important as the direct effects of changing temperature and water table level in controlling future methane fluxes from northern peatlands. Pore water sulfate ammonium nitrate and acetate had a relatively consistent negative relationship with methane emissions pore water DOC had a positive relationship with methane emissions and BNPP had mixed effects. The bog mesocosms had much higher methane emissions and pore water methane concentrations than the fen mesocosms despite a much lower average water table level and peat that is a poor substrate for methanogenesis. We suggest that the relatively high methane fluxes in the bog mesocosms can be explained through their low concentrations of inhibitory pore water compounds high concentrations of DOC and high plant productivity. Stable isotopic data from pore water support acetate fermentation as the principal pathway of methanogenesis in bog mesocosms (mean delta(13) CH(4) equals 41.0 PeRcEnT mean delta D CH(4) equals 190 PeRcEnT). Fen mesocosms had lower pore water concentrations and emissions of methane than bog mesocosms despite much higher methane production potentials in fen peat. The methane from the fen mesocosms was isotopically heavy (mean delta(13)CH(4) equals 28.9 PeRcEnT mean delta D CH(4) equals 140 PeRcEnT) suggesting a strong oxidative sink. This is likely related to the dominance of graminoid vegetation and the associated oxygen transport into the rhizosphere. Our results illustrate the need for a more robust understanding of the multiple feedbacks between climate forcing and plant and microbial feedbacks in the response of northern peatlands to climate change. 1293:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Detailed field studies of methane emissions from rice fields show that when nitrogen fertilizers are used with intermittent irrigation the seasonal average flux is about 3 mg m(2) hr. When continuous flooding and organic material is added to the same fields the emissions rise to nearly 30 mg m(2) hr. Production rates measured during the two years when both organic material and water were applied to these fields were found to be 60 and 90 mg m(2) hr in consecutive years. The fraction oxidized is calculated to be about 80 PeRcEnT one year and 43 PeRcEnT the next year. The results suggest that high organic fertilizer increases production but may affect the emissions more by reducing oxidation. The data show that seasonally averaged emissions vary by up to factor of 2 among adjacent fields but the variability of production is only about 20 PeRcEnT. Information obtained from the farmers suggests that there is a trend towards less use of organic manure as nitrogen fertilizers have become available and the occurrence of intermittent flooding has increased for various reasons. These conditions have likely led to decreasing emissions of methane from rice fields in China in the recent decades. 1294:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide two significant greenhouse gases were measured from rice fields at Qingyuan in Guangdong Province China. The region has a subtropical climate which allows two crops of rice to be grown every year. The prevailing agricultural practices create a complex interaction between factors known to have a major effect on methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice fields namely intermittent flooding and use of organic fertilizers. In this region the farmers depend on nitrogen fertilizers and at least in recent years have only intermittently flooded their fields during the growing seasons. These factors tend to reduce methane emissions. But the rice straw and crop residues from the first crop of the year are plowed into the fields providing a large addition of organic material under hot weather conditions favorable to quick decomposition during the second crop period. This and the addition of farmyard manure increases emissions of methane emissions from these fields. The results of the present study show that the effect of these competing factors and their timing lead to an average rate of emissions of 5 2 and 6 2 mg m(2) h from the first crops for the 2 years when measurements were taken (2003 and 2004) and 12 8 and 13 8 mg m(2) h from the second crop. Further production measurements showed that during the 2 years of these experiments the average production rates were about 27 mg m(2) h for the first crop and 22 34 mg m(2) h for the second crop resulting in estimated oxidation rates of about 80 PeRcEnT for the first crop and 50 60 PeRcEnT for the second crop. The higher fluxes in the second crop therefore appear to be caused more by reduced oxidation than higher production. Nitrous oxide emissions when they were detected usually occurred within a few days after the application of nitrogen fertilizers. The seasonally averaged emissions were between 0.01 and 0.02 mg m(2) h except in the first year when large emissions over one short period pushed the average upward. 1295:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is observed that side by side plots in rice fields managed by the same practices produce methane emissions that are often different by factors of 2 to Similarly on a given day when many plots are sampled the emissions from one plot may differ from another by factors of 3 4 on average. These large variations must be taken into account if these data are extrapolated to larger scales such as countries or the world. In this paper we analyze and delineate the nature of this variability. We distinguish temporal and spatial variability and examine the effects of both on the observed seasonal average emission rates. While temporal variability is managed well in most experiments because frequent measurements are taken the spatial variability remains a potential major uncertainty in many experiments. Using the characteristics of the observed variability we use simulations to show that with a proper and realistic sampling strategy it is possible to get to within 15 PeRcEnT 20 PeRcEnT of the true flux for most cases of interest. We calculate how many plots are needed and how often they should be sampled during the growing season to obtain a seasonal average flux within prescribed limits relative to the true flux. 1296:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Northern temperate and high latitude wetlands are a major source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH(4)). Here we estimate the sensitivity in the strength of this source to the effects of large Icelandic volcanic eruptions such as the Laki eruption of 1783 1784. We applied spatially explicit modeled sulfate aerosol and S deposition fields from a Laki eruption simulation to a climate sensitive model of CH(4) emissions from wetlands. We estimate that the combined influence on climate and S deposition from the Laki eruption halved the output of CH4 from wetlands north of 30 degrees N for the first 12 months following the eruption. The largest short term component responsible for the CH(4) suppression is the aerosol influenced surface cooling although the effect of large scale S deposition on CH(4) emissions provides a longer term suppressive effect on emissions. Together we estimate this combination of processes to result in an annual suppression of similar to 20 Tg CH(4) in the year of the eruption and two subsequent years. Further the impact of the eruption on atmospheric CH(4) concentration extends beyond the likely duration of suppressed emission. The modeled effect of this large Icelandic eruption is consistent with ice core records of atmospheric CH(4) concentrations at the time and is equivalent in size to the current estimated suppressive effect of industrially derived S pollution on the global wetland CH(4) source. 1297:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plant productivity in upland tundra and boreal forest is demonstrably limited by nitrogen (N) and indirect evidence from field studies suggests that decomposition by soil microbes may be similarly limited. As climate warms at high latitudes understanding the response of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition to increased soil temperature may be crucial for determining the net effect of warming on ecosystem carbon (C) balance because temperature directly affects decomposition but also because it has an indirect effect on C balance via nutrient mineralization. We incubated northern Alaskan soils at two temperatures (5 degrees C and 15 degrees C) and two levels of N addition (with and without) to directly test for N limitation of SOM decomposition and to explore the interaction between temperature and N limitation. Over the entire 924 day incubation of organic and mineral soils from two ecosystem types we measured microbial respiration; over the initial 90 days of the incubation we measured microbial biomass N net N mineralization and the isotopic signatures (delta(13)C and Delta(14)C) of microbial respiration. Across soil layers and ecosystem types temperature always had a strong positive effect on SOM decomposition rates whereas N addition had positive negative and neutral effects. When C respiration rates were high the positive N response was generally most strongly expressed for example in the organic soils in the warmer incubation and at the outset of the experiment. Negative N responses often occurred when C respiration rates were lower predominantly in mineral soils and at the middle or end of the experiment. In the subset of soil types where we measured the radiocarbon age of respired CO(2) increased decomposition was related to increased use of older C. Net N mineralization and nitrification were not affected by temperature but N addition increased net N immobilization in all soil layers and microbial biomass N in organic layers. Our data support the general idea that at least in these high latitude organic soils decomposition of labile carbon can be positively stimulated by added N whereas decomposition of recalcitrant C is suppressed. 1298:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sulfate in acid rain is known to suppress methane (CH(4)) emissions from natural freshwater wetlands. Here we examine the possibility that CH(4) emissions from rice agriculture may be similarly affected by acid rain a major and increasing pollution problem in Asia. Our findings suggest that acid rain rates of SO(4)(2 ) deposition may help to reduce CH(4) emissions from rice agriculture. Emissions from rice plants treated with simulated acid rain at levels of SO(4)(2 ) consistent with the range of deposition in Asia were reduced by 24 PeRcEnT during the grain filling and ripening stage of the rice season which accounts for 50 PeRcEnT of the overall CH(4) that is normally emitted in a rice season. A single application of SO(4)(2 ) at a comparable level reduced CH(4) emission by 43 PeRcEnT. We hypothesize that the reduction in CH(4) emission may be due to a combination of effects. The first mechanism is that the low rates of SO(4)(2 ) may be sufficient to boost yields of rice and in so doing may cause a reduction in root exudates to the rhizosphere a key substrate source for methanogenesis. Decreasing a major substrate source for methanogens is also likely to intensify competition with sulfate reducing microorganisms for whom prior SO(4)(2 ) limitation had been lifted by the simulated acid rain S deposition. 1299:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The role of saline lakes in CO2 exchange with the atmosphere was evaluated on the basis of calculated partial pressure (pCO(2)) and CO2 exchange rates with the atmosphere derived from a compilation of published data for 196 saline lakes around the world. The average surface water pCO(2) exceeded atmospheric pCO(2) by a factor of 5 8 times indicative of a tendency for saline lakes to emit CO2 to the atmosphere. Chemically enhanced emission calculated from solute chemistry pH and wind speed increased gas exchange an average of 2.3 times over that of freshwater lakes having equivalent pCO(2). The globally distributed lakes emitted CO2 at rates in excess of 80 mmol m( 2) d( 1). The Caspian Sea was calculated to support alone a total CO2 emission of 0.02 to 0.04 Gt C a( 1) with the total CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from saline lakes calculated to be 0.11 0.15 Gt C a( 1). Consideration of CO2 emissions from saline lakes raises the total CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from all lakes to 0.28 0.32 Gt CO2. These results point to a significant role of saline lakes in global C cycling. 1300:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This synthesis addresses the vulnerability of the North American high latitude soil organic carbon (SOC) pool to climate change. Disturbances caused by climate warming in arctic subarctic and boreal environments can result in significant redistribution of C among major reservoirs with potential global impacts. We divide the current northern high latitude SOC pools into (1) near surface soils where SOC is affected by seasonal freeze thaw processes and changes in moisture status and (2) deeper permafrost and peatland strata down to several tens of meters depth where SOC is usually not affected by short term changes. We address key factors (permafrost vegetation hydrology paleoenvironmental history) and processes (C input storage decomposition and output) responsible for the formation of the large high latitude SOC pool in North America and highlight how climate related disturbances could alter this pools character and size. Press disturbances of relatively slow but persistent nature such as top down thawing of permafrost and changes in hydrology microbiological communities pedological processes and vegetation types as well as pulse disturbances of relatively rapid and local nature such as wildfires and thermokarst could substantially impact SOC stocks. Ongoing climate warming in the North American high latitude region could result in crossing environmental thresholds thereby accelerating press disturbances and increasingly triggering pulse disturbances and eventually affecting the C source sink net character of northern high latitude soils. Finally we assess postdisturbance feedbacks models and predictions for the northern high latitude SOC pool and discuss data and research gaps to be addressed by future research. 130:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1316:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The change in dissolved inorganic delta C 13 in the ocean resulting from the change in delta C 13 in atmospheric CO2 owing to anthropogenic activities (the Suess effect) is well known. The need to correct for the Suess effect when applying delta C 13 in organic matter in lacustrine sediment deposited during the anthropocene as a productivity proxy is widely although not universally acknowledged. This paper reviews conceptions about the Suess effect in lacustrine delta C 13(org) and methods to adjust for the Suess effect when delta C 13(org) is used to infer recent changes in aquatic productivity. Lake Tanganyika is used as an example to illustrate the necessity of the correction. When the Suess effect is not considered interpretations of sediment core data can result that are opposite to those achieved with the correction applied as is here shown in Lake Tanganyika and in other lakes. A new method to correct for the Suess effect is provided which has the advantage of being applicable to data for a larger period (1700 2000) than methods currently available. In addition Lake Tanganyika is shown to be a net sink for CO2. 1331:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We collected 541 invertebrate specimens in riparian and upland habitats of the South Fork (SF) Eel River California USA representing 12 orders and 55 families and including adults of both aquatic and terrestrial origin. We fitted a power function to this data set at 4 taxonomic levels: 1) the entire pooled sample 2) composite samples of aquatic and terrestrial taxa 3) individual orders and 4) individual families for which there were adequate data (n   8; 24 families). Coefficients of determination (R 2) for length mass relationships generally increased with increasing taxonomic specificity. Composite samples of aquatic and terrestrial taxa had significantly different length mass relationships with dry mass increasing faster with length in terrestrial taxa. Differences in length dry mass relationships between aquatic and terrestrial taxa appeared to result from significantly higher slopes for terrestrial taxa in length width relationships and significantly lower slopes in length water content relationships. Our results suggest that the use of terrestrial regressions to estimate aquatic insect biomass flux in riparian habitats overestimates both the absolute magnitude of biomass flux as well as its relative importance to insect standing stocks. Development of unique regression algorithms for adult aquatic insect taxa increases the accuracy of aquatic insect biomass estimates in terrestrial habitats. 1367:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The percentage of a watershed occupied by agricultural areas is widely used to predict nutrient loadings and in stream water chemistry because water quality is often linked to non point sources in a watershed. Measures of the spatial location of source areas have generally not been incorporated into such landscape indicators although empirical evidence and watershed loading models suggest that spatially explicit information is useful for predicting loadings. I created a heuristic grid based surface flow model to address the discrepancies between spatially explicit and non spatial approaches to understanding watershed loading. The mean and variance in loading were compared among thousands of simulated watersheds with varying percentages of randomly located source and sinks. The variability in loading among replicate landscapes was greatest for those landscapes with similar to 65 PeRcEnT source areas. This variance peak suggests that considering the spatial arrangement of cover types is most important for watersheds with intermediate relative abundances of sources and sinks as the wide variety of different spatial configurations can lead to either very high or very low loading. Increasing the output from source pixels (relative to the amount absorbed by sink pixels) among different landscapes moved the peak in variance to landscapes with lower percentages of sources. A final scenario examined both broad and fine scale heterogeneity in source output to disentangle the relative contributions of spatial configuration percentage of source covers and heterogeneity of sources in governing variability in loading. In landscapes with high percentages of source pixels fine scale heterogeneity in source output was responsible for a greater portion of the total variability in loading among different watersheds than was spatial arrangement. These results provide several testable hypotheses for when spatial and non spatial approaches might be most useful in relating land cover to water chemistry and suggest improvements for the spatial sensitivity analyses of eco hydrologic watershed models. 136:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plants and animals exploit the soil for food and shelter and in the process affect it in many different ways. For example uprooted trees may break up bedrock transport soil downslope increase the heterogeneity of soil respiration rates and inhibit soil horizonation. In this contribution we review previously published papers that provide insights into the process of bioturbation. We focus particularly on studies that allow us to place bioturbation within a quantitative framework that links the form of hillslopes with the processes of sediment transport and soil production. Using geometrical relationships and data from others work we derive simple sediment flux equations for tree throw and root growth and decay. 1372:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key parameter in lakes that can affect numerous features including microbial metabolism light climate acidity and primary production. In an attempt to understand the factors that regulate DOC in lakes we assembled a large database ( 7 514 lakes from 6 continents) of DOC concentrations and other parameters that characterize the conditions in the lakes the catchment the soil and the climate. DOC concentrations were in the range 0.1 332 mg L( 1) and the median was 5.71 mg L( 1). A partial least squares regression explained 48 PeRcEnT of the variability in lake DOC and showed that altitude mean annual runoff and precipitation were negatively correlated with lake DOC while conductivity soil carbon density and soil C: N ratio were positively related with lake DOC. A multiple linear regression using altitude mean annual runoff and soil carbon density as predictors explained 40 PeRcEnT of the variability in lake DOC. While lake area and drainage ratio (catchment : lake area) were not correlated to lake DOC in the global data set these two factors explained significant variation of the residuals of the multiple linear regression model in several regional subsets of data. These results suggest a hierarchical regulation of DOC in lakes where climatic and topographic characteristics set the possible range of DOC concentrations of a certain region and catchment and lake properties then regulate the DOC concentration in each individual lake. 1373:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Evaluation of the effects of climate change and human activities on lakes requires improved understanding of how stressors interact and the degree to which individual sentinel lakes represent broad spatial patterns of ecosystem response to disturbance. We surveyed modern water chemistry (major ions conductivity salinity lake volume) and sediments (algal pigments stable isotopes) in 21 lakes that surround Humboldt Lake Saskatchewan site of a 2 000 yr climate reconstruction to quantify spatial synchrony (S the mean among lake correlation coefficient) of prairie lake response to climate variability land use and their interactions. Whole lake mass balances of total dissolved substances constructed at each site revealed that evaporation of water controlled seasonal changes in salt content only in years with dry summers (2003) leading to widespread spatial coherence of ecosystems (S equals 0.78). In contrast variations in hydrologic inputs (precipitation groundwater) and solute fluxes regulated salt balances of lakes during years with wet summers (2004 2005) and substantially reduced lake synchrony (S equals 0.13 0.58). Furthermore  25 PeRcEnT of sites exhibited increased nitrogen influx (as delta N 15) and cyanobacterial production (as fossil pigments) between ca. 1920 and 2003 with particularly strong effects of land use recorded for northeastern sites where evaporative forcing was greatest. Finally principal component and canonical ordinations with redundancy analysis both explained similar to 50 PeRcEnT of the variance in lake sensitivity to climate and land use and revealed that the effects of climate and land use interacted strongly but that the unique effects of each factor remained identifiable in modern lake surveys. 1374:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Evaporation and groundwater fluxes are thought to regulate hydrologic variability in lakes of the northern Great Plains but little is known of how the relative importance of these processes may vary in time or space. To address this issue we measured the isotopic composition of water (delta(18)O delta(2)H) from 70 closed basin lakes in southern Saskatchewan Canada. All lakes occupied endorheic basins along a long gradient of salinity (0.2 115 g total dissolved solids L( 1)). Lakes exhibited synchronous seasonal changes in salinity (synchrony S equals 0.78) and delta(18)O (S equals 0.84) during the dry summer of 2003 (similar to 195 mm rain) whereas coherence was reduced to 0.56 and 0.22 respectively during the wet summer of 2004 (similar to 295 mm rain). However despite evaporative enrichment of isotopic ratios during dry summers hydrologic balances were regulated mainly by changes in water inflow (I) rather than evaporation (E) in both wet and dry years with particularly strong influence of inflow ( lowest E : I ratio) in dry southwestern regions. Analysis of isotopic composition also identified winter precipitation or groundwater as the most influential source of water to most lakes despite only similar to 30 PeRcEnT of annual precipitation being delivered during winter. Therefore although seasonal variability in lake chemistry was influenced by evaporation during summer long term mean chemical characteristics of prairie lakes were regulated mainly by changes in winter precipitation or groundwater influx. 1375:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One of the major impediments to the integration of lentic ecosystems into global environmental analyses has been fragmentary data on the extent and size distribution of lakes ponds and impoundments. We use new data sources enhanced spatial resolution and new analytical approaches to provide new estimates of the global abundance of surface water bodies. A global model based on the Pareto distribution shows that the global extent of natural lakes is twice as large as previously known (304 million lakes; 4.2 million km(2) in area) and is dominated in area by millions of water bodies smaller than 1 km(2). Similar analyses of impoundments based on inventories of large engineered dams show that impounded waters cover approximately 0.26 million km(2). However construction of low tech farm impoundments is estimated to be between 0.1 PeRcEnT and 6 PeRcEnT of farm area worldwide dependent upon precipitation and represents   77 000 km(2) globally at present. Overall about 4.6 million km(2) of the earths continental   land   surface (  3 PeRcEnT) is covered by water. These analyses underscore the importance of explicitly considering lakes ponds and impoundments especially small ones in global analyses of rates and processes. 1377:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We derive a simple prediction about euphotic zone N:P stoichiometry from a large class of models that use saturating nutrient uptake functions to characterize N and P acquisition by phytoplankton. The prediction is: At an ecological steady state the ratio of phytoplankton N: P to inorganic N: P in the euphotic zone equals the ratio of phytoplankton maximum uptake rates of N and P. We estimate this predicted ratio using nutrient uptake parameters measured in laboratory growth experiments and compare the predicted ratio to empirical observations from long term sampling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The model predictions for the ratio of phytoplankton N: P to inorganic N: P are at odds with the majority of data from extensive long term sampling in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. This discrepancy calls into question the scope of applicability of ecosystem models that explicitly describe phytoplankton growth as a function of N and P availability. We discuss efforts to resolve this discrepancy including the need for performing more comprehensive N and P uptake experiments and by re examining models of nutrient uptake. 1378:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities including construction of impoundments which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments. 1379:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We investigated photochemical seasonal and source effects on copper (Cu) complexation by dissolved organic matter (DOM). Cu DOM complexation regulates Cu toxicity by decreasing the activity of the cupric ion ( Cu2 ) the most bioavailable Cu species. However DOM is photochemically unstable under solar insolation. We analyzed Cu DOM complexation before and after photooxidation of DOM collected from six rivers during spring runoff and late summer (n equals 12 DOM samples). After irradiation of DOM for 24 h in a solar simulator (similar to 4 d of ambient insolation) we analyzed Cu DOM complexation during potentiometric titrations of Cu into dissolved organic carbon concentrations of 5 mg L 1. In 10 DOM samples across the range of titrations (Cu 7.8 x 10( 8) to 8.7 x 10( 6) mol L 1) photooxidation of DOM decreased Cu complexation increasing Cu2 by an average of 156 PeRcEnT 28 PeRcEnT ((x) over bar SE). In one DOM sample irradiation had no net effect on Cu2 (6 PeRcEnT 12 PeRcEnT) whereas in another Cu complexation was enhanced (30 PeRcEnT 4 PeRcEnT). Cu complexation that was indistinguishable before irradiation decreased significantly more during photooxidation of DOM in spring (185 PeRcEnT 25 PeRcEnT) than in summer (74 PeRcEnT 14 PeRcEnT). The specific ultraviolet absorption coefficient at 254 mu explained similar to 60 PeRcEnT of the variation in conditional stability constants of Cu DOM complexes regardless of DOM source season or extent of photooxidation. During a simulated contaminant event where 1.5 x 10 6 mol L 1 Cu was added to site waters water chemistry reduced bioavailability in 6 of 12 cases to below the Cu2 expected to cause 50 PeRcEnT mortality ( Cu2 (ILC50)) in larval fish. However after 6 d of photooxidation none of the site waters remained below CU2 (LC50). 1433:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The utility of microsatellite markers for inferring population size and trend has not been rigorously examined even though these markers are commonly used to monitor the demography of natural populations. We assessed the ability of a linkage disequilibrium estimator of effective population size (N(e)) and a simple capture recapture estimator of abundance (N) to quantify the size and trend of stable or declining populations (true N equals 100 10 000) using simulated Wright Fisher populations. Neither method accurately or precisely estimated abundance at sample sizes of S equals 30 individuals regardless of true N. However if larger samples of S equals 60 or 120 individuals were collected these methods provided useful insights into abundance and trends for populations of N equals 100 500. At small population sizes (N equals 100 or 250) precision of the N(e) estimates was improved slightly more by a doubling of loci sampled than by a doubling of individuals sampled. In general monitoring N(e) proved a more robust means of identifying stable and declining populations than monitoring N over most of the parameter space we explored and performance of the N(e) estimator is further enhanced if the N(e) N ratio is low. However at the largest population size (N equals 10 000) N estimation outperformed N(e). Both methods generally required   5 generations to pass between sampling events to correctly identify population trend. 1447:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With fossil fuel combustion and land use activities threatening to double atmospheric carbon dioxide this century maintaining large forests as carbon reservoirs becomes an additional conservation incentive. We have developed a stochastic empirical model that simulates forest carbon cycling and now use this model to explore the response of the central Amazonian forest to an increase in biomass productivity. Our results show that these trees will accumulate carbon in their wood for more than a century after a productivity increase underscoring the value of intact tropical forests. Given a large increase in productivity we calculate the rate of carbon sequestration to be of the order of 0.2 0.3 petagrams of carbon per year (which amounts to US DoLlQuAnT 2 3 billion per year at  DoLlQuAnT 10 per Mg C) for large wood of the intact forest in Amazonia compared to fossil fuel emissions of roughly 6 Pg of C per year. In all scenarios that reduce emissions to levels commensurate with the Kyoto protocol numerous net biospheric exchanges of carbon are important. But terrestrial sequestration can only offer a partial solution so controlling atmospheric CO2 will require substantial reductions in fossil fuel emissions in the coming decades. 1460:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological and environmental contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial systems have hindered analyses of community and ecosystem structure across Earths diverse habitats. Ecological stoichiometry(1 2) provides an integrative approach for such analyses as all organisms are composed of the same major elements (C N P) whose balance affects production nutrient cycling and food web dynamics(3 4). Here we show both similarities and differences in the C:N:P ratios of primary producers (autotrophs) and invertebrate primary consumers (herbivores) across habitats. Terrestrial food webs are built on an extremely nutrient poor autotroph base with C:P and C:N ratios higher than in lake particulate matter although the N:P ratios are nearly identical. Terrestrial herbivores (insects) and their freshwater counterparts (zooplankton) are nutrient rich and indistinguishable in C:N:P stoichiometry. In both lakes and terrestrial systems herbivores should have low growth efficiencies (10 30 PeRcEnT) when consuming autotrophs with typical carbon to nutrient ratios. These stoichiometric constraints on herbivore growth appear to be qualitatively similar and widespread in both environments. 1468:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human actions are causing declines in plant biodiversity increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and increases in nitrogen deposition; however the interactive effects of these factors on ecosystem processes are unknown(1 2). Reduced biodiversity has raised numerous concerns including the possibility that ecosystem functioning may be affected negatively(1 4) which might be particularly important in the face of other global changes(5 6). Here we present results of a grassland field experiment in Minnesota USA that tests the hypothesis that plant diversity and composition influence the enhancement of biomass and carbon acquisition in ecosystems subjected to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition. The study experimentally controlled plant diversity (1 4 9 or 16 species) soil nitrogen (unamended versus deposition of 4 g of nitrogen per m(2) per yr) and atmospheric CO2 concentrations using free air CO2 enrichment (ambient 368 mu mol mol( 1) versus elevated 560 mu mol mol( 1)). We found that the enhanced biomass accumulation in response to elevated levels of CO2 or nitrogen or their combination is less in species poor than in species rich assemblages. 148:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Observations of the tropical nitrogen NI cycle over the past half century indicate that intact tropical forests tend to accumulate and recycle large quantities of N relative to temperate forests as evidenced by plant and soil N to phosphorus (P) ratios by P limitation of plant growth in some tropical forests by an abundance of N fixing plants and by sustained export of bioavailable N at the ecosystem scale. However this apparent up regulation of the ecosystem N cycle introduces a biogeochemical paradox when considered from the perspective of physiology and evolution of individual plants: The putative source for tropical N richness symbiotic N fixation should in theory be physiologically down regulated as internal pools of bioavailable N build. We review the evidence for tropical N richness and evaluate several hypotheses that may explain its emergence and maintenance. We propose a leaky nitrostat model that is capable of resolving the paradox at scales of both ecosystems and individual N fixing organisms. 1496:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nonstructural carbohydrate reserves support tree metabolism and growth when current photosynthates are insufficient offering resilience in times of stress. We monitored stemwood nonstructural carbohydrate (starch and sugars) concentrations of the dominant tree species at three sites in the northeastern United States. We estimated the mean age of the starch and sugars in a subset of trees using the radiocarbon (14C) bomb spike. With these data we then tested different carbon (C) allocation schemes in a process based model of forest C cycling. We found that the nonstructural carbohydrates are both highly dynamic and about a decade old. Seasonal dynamics in starch (two to four times higher in the growing season lower in the dormant season) mirrored those of sugars. Radiocarbon based estimates indicated that the mean age of the starch and sugars in red maple (Acer rubrum) was 714 similar to yr. A two pool (fast and slow cycling reserves) model structure gave reasonable estimates of the size and mean residence time of the total NSC pool and greatly improved model predictions of interannual variability in woody biomass increment compared with zero or one pool structures used in the majority of existing models. This highlights the importance of nonstructural carbohydrates in the context of forest ecosystem carbon cycling. 1497:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P Patterns in the natural abundance of nitrogen (N) isotopes (15N and 14N) can help in the understanding of ecosystem processes along environmental gradients because some processes fractionate against the heavier isotope. We measured delta 15N in many components of the Franz Josef soil chronosequence in New Zealand to see how each component varied along the sequence and within sites and to see what this variation can tell us about how ecosystem processes such as N losses change with soil age. We analyzed delta 15N in foliage from 18 woody species abscised leaves from seven woody species three soil horizons bryophytes lichens bulk deposition and nodules from the N fixing tree Coriaria arborea (Coriariaceae). Foliar delta 15N varied significantly across plant species. Foliage and bulk litter became 15N depleted as soil age increased. Soil N from organic and mineral horizons was significantly more 15N enriched than bulk litter N at each site. Increasing precipitation also decreased foliar and soil delta 15N. Comparing input and whole ecosystem delta 15N revealed limited evidence for net fractionation during N losses. These trends are consistent with some combination of increasing fractionation during plant N uptake mycorrhizal transfer within plant processing and soil decomposition as soils age. 1503:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although biogeochemistry is an integrative discipline terrestrial and aquatic subdisciplines have developed somewhat independently of each other. Physical and biological differences between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems explain this history. In both aquatic and terrestrial biogeochemistry key questions and concepts arise from a focus on nutrient limitation ecosystem nutrient retention and controls of nutrient transformations. Current understanding is captured in conceptual models for different ecosystem types which share some features and diverge in other ways. Distinctiveness of subdisciplines has been appropriate in some respects and has fostered important advances in theory. On the other hand lack of integration between aquatic and terrestrial biogeochemistry limits our ability to deal with biogeochemical phenomena across large landscapes in which connections between terrestrial and aquatic elements are important. Separation of the two approaches also has not served attempts to scale up or to estimate fluxes from large areas based on plot measurements. Understanding connectivity between the two system types and scaling up biogeochemical information will rely on coupled hydrologic and ecological models and may be critical for addressing environmental problems associated with locally regionally and globally altered biogeochemical cycles. 1512:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Quantitative integration of the literature on the effect of elevated CO(2) on woody plants is important to aid our understanding of forest health in coming decades and to better predict terrestrial feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. We used meta analytic methods to summarize and interpret more than 500 reports of effects of elevated CO(2) on woody plant biomass accumulation and partitioning gas exchange and leaf nitrogen and starch content. The CO(2) effect size metric we used was the log transformed ratio of elevated compared to ambient response means weighted by the inverse of the variance of the log ratio. Variation in effect size among studies was partitioned according to the presence of interacting stress factors length of CO(2) exposure functional group status pot size and type of CO(2) exposure facility. Both total biomass (WT) and net CO(2) assimilation (A) increased significantly at about twice ambient CO(2) regardless of growth conditions. Low soil nutrient availability reduced the CO(2) stimulation of WT by half from 31 PeRcEnT under optimal conditions to 16 PeRcEnT while low light increased the response to 52 PeRcEnT. We found no significant shifts in biomass allocation under high CO(2). Interacting stress factors had no effect on the magnitude of responses of A to CO(2) although plants grown in growth chambers had significantly lower responses ( 19 PeRcEnT) than those grown in greenhouses or in open top chambers ( 54 PeRcEnT). We found no consistent evidence for photosynthetic acclimation to CO(2) enrichment except in trees grown in pots   0.51 ( 36 PeRcEnT) and no significant CO(2) effect on stomatal conductance. Both leaf dark respiration and leaf nitrogen were significantly reduced under elevated CO(2) ( 18 PeRcEnT and 16 PeRcEnT respectively data expressed on a leaf mass basis) while leaf starch content increased significantly except in low nutrient grown gymnosperms. Our results provide robust statistically defensible estimates of elevated CO(2) effect sizes against which new results may be compared or for use in forest and climate model parameterization. 152:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,154:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A variety of transport processes operate within the biosphere at all temporal and spatial scales. Temporary events or chronic conditions both scale dependent instigate the transport of entities having material energetic or informational properties via several different transport vectors. The fluxes and influences imparted by these transport phenomena shape the physical environment underlie gene flow facilitate animal communication and constrain the nature of local systems. These transport phenomena have been highly altered in the last century as humankind has become an ever more potent force in the earth system. As a result issues of environmental and earth system science are to. a considerable extent aspects of transport phenomena. A general appreciation for transport phenomena broadly defined is vital to gaining an appropriate perspective on the fluid nature of the earth system and to defining system structure and function through present and past events. 1556:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The tissue chemistry of plants can influence ecosystem processes including growth herbivory and decomposition. Our comparison of nitrogen and phosphorus in over 1700 autotroph taxa demonstrates that latitudinal trends in tissue chemistry are consistent across non vascular and vascular species in freshwater terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Tissue chemistry varies most within species and taxonomic lineages yet the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio within individuals is strikingly similar among species in different ecosystems. These results shed new light on existing hypotheses suggesting that light  photon flux) and growing season duration are primary drivers of latitudinal gradients in tissue chemistry but providing little support for temperature nutrient supply or soil substrate age. Photoautotroph nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) tissue concentrations can influence ecosystem function via processes including growth decomposition and consumption and may reflect traits maintaining coexistence. Studies in terrestrial systems have led to hypotheses that latitudinal trends in the N and P content of leaves may be driven by soil substrate age environmental temperature or season length; however terrestrial patterns alone cannot differentiate these mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that broad geographical patterns of N and P in freshwater and marine multicellular photoautotrophs are concordant with those in terrestrial ecosystems. Our   6800 record database reveals that mean tissue N and P increase with latitude in all ecosystems but P increases more rapidly causing N:P to decline; mean N:P scaling within individuals also is identical among systems despite very different evolutionary environments. A partitioning of the variance in these data suggests that species composition and local environmental context likely lead to the variation observed within a latitudinal band. However the consistency of trends in photosynthetic tissue chemistry across Earths ecosystems suggests that biogeographical gradients in insolation and growing season length may constrain tissue N and P whereas global trends in temperature nutrient supply and soil substrate age are unlikely to generate the consistent latitudinal trends among ecosystems. Thus this cross ecosystem comparison suggests a new hypothesis global patterns of insolation while also providing a new perspective on other mechanisms that have been hypothesized to underlie latitudinal trends in photosynthetic tissue chemistry. 161:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mechanistic models predicting copper (Cu) toxicity to aquatic biota in natural waters require organic and inorganic water chemistry and quantified values for Cu binding by sensitive biological receptors. In bioaccumulation experiments using larval fathead minnows (FHM; Pimephales promelas) we investigated time to asymptotic accumulation of Cu and quantified the conditional stability constants (binding affinity; log Kcu FHM) and binding site densities of Cu FHM complexation. Cu bioaccumulation increased rapidly approaching an asymptote in exposures longer than 12 h indicating that Cu loading at 24 h is an appropriate exposure duration for modeling Cu complexation by larval FHM. Results of Langmuir and Scatchard analyses of other bioaccumulation experiments produced log KCu FHM values of 6.52 and binding site densities of 0.39 mu mol g( 1) dry weight. These whole body log KCu FHM values are approximately an order of magnitude lower than those reported for adult FHM gills. However binding site densities for larval and adult FHM are similar. Under similar test conditions comparable concentrations of aqueous Cu cause 50 PeRcEnT mortality in adult and larval FHM suggesting that binding site densities determine comparable metal tissue loadings and have greater influence on Cu bioavailability than binding affinity. 1639:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Research on permafrost carbon has dramatically increased in the past few years. A new estimate of 1672 Pg C of belowground organic carbon in the northern circumpolar permafrost region more than doubles the previous value and highlights the potential role of permafrost carbon in the Earth System. Uncertainties in this new estimate remain due to relatively few available pedon data for certain geographic sectors and the deeper cryoturbated soil horizons and the large polygon size in the soil maps used for upscaling. The large permafrost carbon pool is not equally distributed across the landscape: peat deposits cryoturbated soils and the loess like deposits of the yedoma complex contain disproportionately large amounts of soil organic matter often exhibiting a low degree of decomposition. Recent findings in Alaska and northern Sweden provide strong evidence that the deeper soil carbon in permafrost terrain is starting to be released supporting previous reports from Siberia. The permafrost carbon pool is not yet fully integrated in climate and ecosystem models and an important objective should be to define typical pedons appropriate for model setups. The thawing permafrost carbon feedback needs to be included in model projections of future climate change.  1684:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixing trees are rare in late successional temperate forests even though these forests are often N limited. Two hypotheses could explain this paradox. The phylogenetic constraints hypothesis states that no late successional tree taxa in temperate forests belong to clades that are predisposed to N fixation. Conversely the selective constraints hypothesis states that such taxa are present but N fixing symbioses would lower their fitness. Here we test the phylogenetic constraints hypothesis. Using U.S. forest inventory data we derived successional indices related to shade tolerance and stand age for N fixing trees non fixing trees in the potentially N fixing clade (smallest angiosperm clade that includes all N fixers) and non fixing trees outside this clade. We then used phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) to test for associations between these successional indices and N fixation. Four results stand out from our analysis of U. S. trees. First N fixers are less shade tolerant than non fixers both inside and outside of the potentially N fixing clade. Second N fixers tend to occur in younger stands in a given geographical region than non fixers both inside and outside of the potentially N fixing clade. Third the potentially N fixing clade contains numerous late successional non fixers. Fourth although the N fixation trait is evolutionarily conserved the successional traits are relatively labile. These results suggest that selective constraints not phylogenetic constraints explain the rarity of late successional N fixing trees in temperate forests. Because N fixing trees could overcome N limitation to net primary production if they were abundant this study helps to understand the maintenance of N limitation in temperate forests and therefore the capacity of this biome to sequester carbon. 1703:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nutrient limitation to net primary production (NPP) displays a diversity of patterns as ecosystems develop over a range of timescales. For example some ecosystems transition from N limitation on young soils to P limitation on geologically old soils whereas others appear to remain N limited. Under what conditions should N limitation and P limitation prevail? When do transitions between N and P limitation occur? We analyzed transient dynamics of multiple timescales in an ecosystem model to investigate these questions. Post disturbance dynamics in our model are controlled by a cascade of rates from plant uptake (very fast) to litter turnover (fast) to plant mortality (intermediate) to plant unavailable nutrient loss (slow) to weathering (very slow). Young ecosystems are N limited when symbiotic N fixation (SNF) is constrained and P weathering inputs are high relative to atmospheric N deposition and plant N: P demand but P limited under opposite conditions. In the absence of SNF N limitation is likely to worsen through succession (decades to centuries) because P is mineralized faster than N. Over long timescales (centuries and longer) this preferential P mineralization increases the N: P ratio of soil organic matter leading to greater losses of plant unavailable N versus P relative to plant N: P demand. These loss dynamics favor N limitation on older soils despite the rising organic matter N: P ratio. However weathering depletion favors P limitation on older soils when continual P inputs (e. g. dust deposition) are low so nutrient limitation at the terminal equilibrium depends on the balance of these input and loss effects. If NPP switches from N to P limitation over long time periods the transition time depends most strongly on the P weathering rate. At all timescales SNF has the capacity to overcome N limitation so nutrient limitation depends critically on limits to SNF. 1734:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Global biogeochemical models have improved dramatically in the last decade in their representation of the biosphere. Although leaf area data are an important input to such models and are readily available globally global root distributions for modeling water and nutrient uptake and carbon cycling have not been available. This analysis provides global distributions for fine root biomass length and surface area with depth in the soil and global estimates of nutrient pools in fine roots. Calculated root surface area is almost always greater than leaf area more than an order of magnitude so in grasslands. The average C:N:P ratio in living fine roots is 450:11:1 and global fine root carbon is more than 5 PeRcEnT of all carbon contained in the atmosphere. Assuming conservatively that fine roots turn over once per year they represent 33 PeRcEnT of global annual net primary productivity. 1780:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the storage flux and turnover of nutrients in organisms is important for quantifying contributions of biota to biogeochemical cycles. Here we present a model that predicts the storage of phosphorus rich RNA and whole body phosphorus content in eukaryotes based on the mass and temperature dependence of ATP production in mitochondria. Data from a broad assortment of eukaryotes support the models two main predictions. First whole body RNA concentration is proportional to mitochondrial density and consequently scales with body mass to the 1 4 power. Second whole body phosphorus content declines with increasing body mass in eukaryotic unicells but approaches a relatively constant value in large multicellular animals because the fraction of phosphorus in RNA decreases relative to the fraction in other pools. Extension of the model shows that differences in the flux of RNA associated phosphorus are due to the size dependencies of metabolic rate and RNA concentration. Thus the model explicitly links two biological currencies at the individual level: energy in the form of ATIP and materials in the form of phosphorus both of which are critical to the functioning of ecosystems. The model provides a framework for linking attributes of individuals to the storage and flux of phosphorus in ecosystems. 17:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nitrogen inputs to the US from human activity doubled between 1961 and 1997 with most of the increase in the 1960s and 1970s. The largest increase was in use of inorganic N fertilizer but emissions of NO from fossil fuel combustion also increased substantially. In 1961 N fixation in agricultural systems was the largest single source of reactive N in the US. By 1997 even though N fixation had increased fertilizer use and NOx emissions had increased more rapidly and were both larger inputs. In both 1961 and 1997 two thirds of reactive N inputs were denitrified or stored in soils and biota while one third was exported. The largest export was in riverine flux to coastal oceans followed by export in food and feeds and atmospheric advection to the oceans. The consumption of meat protein is a major driver behind N use in agriculture in the US Without change in diet or agricultural practices fertilizer use will increase over next 30 years and fluxes to coastal oceans may increase by another 30 PeRcEnT. However substantial reductions are possible. 181:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A regression model (RivR N) was developed that predicts the proportion of N removed from streams and reservoirs as an inverse function of the water displacement time of the water body (ratio of water body depth to water time of travel). When applied to 16 drainage networks in the eastern U.S. the RivR N model predicted that 37 PeRcEnT to 76 PeRcEnT of N input to these rivers is removed during transport through the river networks. Approximately half of that is removed in 1st through 4th order streams which account for 90 PeRcEnT of the total stream length. The other half is removed in 5th order and higher rivers which account for only about 10 PeRcEnT of the total stream length. Most N removed in these higher orders is predicted to originate from watershed loading to small and intermediate sized streams. The proportion of N removed from all streams in the watersheds (37 76 PeRcEnT) is considerably higher than the proportion of N input to an individual reach that is removed in that reach (generally  20 PeRcEnT) because of the cumulative effect of continued nitrogen removal along the entire flow path in downstream reaches. This generally has not been recognized in previous studies but is critical to an evaluation of the total amount of N removed within a river network. At the river network scale reservoirs were predicted to have a minimal effect on N removal. A fairly modest decrease ( 10 percentage points) in the N removed at the river network scale was predicted when a third of the direct watershed loading was to the two highest orders compared to a uniform loading. 182:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Growing populations in northeast Asia have greatly altered the nitrogen cycle with increases in agricultural production to feed the Population and with increases in N emissions and transboundary air pollution. For example during the 1900s over 50 PeRcEnT of the N deposition over Republic of Korea was imported from abroad. In this paper we present biogeochemical budgets of N for the South Korean peninsula (the Republic of Korea) and for the Yellow Sea region. We quantify N inputs from atmospheric deposition fertilizers biological fixation and imports of food feed and products. We quantify outputs in riverine export crop uptake denitrification volatilization runoff sedimentation and sea water exchange. Calculations were conducted using mean values from 1994 1997. All of the nitrogen budgets were positive with N inputs exceeding outputs. The excess N inputs gave rise to increases in N storage in landfills and in groundwater. Annual accumulation of N in the Yellow sea including inputs from South Korea and other drainage areas was 1229 kt yr( 1) with a residence time for N of approximately 1.5 years thus doubling N content in marine waters every 3 years during 1994 1997. The human derived N inputs leads to excessive eutrophication and pollution of the Yellow Sea. 183:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human activities have greatly altered the nitrogen (N) cycle accelerating the rate of N fixation in landscapes and delivery of N to water bodies. To examine relationships between anthropogenic N inputs and riverine N export we constructed budgets describing N inputs and losses for 16 catchments which encompass a range of climatic variability and are major drainages to the coast of the North Atlantic Ocean along a latitudinal profile from Maine to Virginia. Using data from the early 1990s we quantified inputs of N to each catchment from atmospheric deposition application of nitrogenous fertilizers biological nitrogen fixation and import of N in agricultural products (food and feed). We compared these inputs with N losses from the system in riverine export. The importance of the relative sources varies widely by catchment and is related to land use. Net atmospheric deposition was the largest N source ( 60 PeRcEnT) to the forested basins of northern New England  Penobscot and Kennebec); net import of N in food was the largest source of N to the more populated regions of southern New England  Charles Blackstone); and agricultural inputs were the dominant N sources in the Mid Atlantic region  Schuylkill and Potomac). Over the combined area of the catchments net atmospheric deposition was the largest single source input (31 PeRcEnT) followed by net imports of N in food and feed (25 PeRcEnT) fixation in agricultural lands (24 PeRcEnT) fertilizer use (15 PeRcEnT) and fixation ill forests (5 PeRcEnT). The combined effect of fertilizer use fixation in crop lands and animal feed imports makes agriculture the largest overall source of N. Riverine export of N is well correlated with N inputs but it accounts for only a fraction (25 PeRcEnT) of the total N inputs. This work provides an understanding of the sources of N in landscapes and highlights how human activities impact N cycling in the northeast region. 184:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Litter decomposition contributes to one of the largest fluxes of carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and is a primary control on nutrient cycling. The inability of models using climate and litter chemistry to predict decomposition in dry environments has stimulated investigation of non traditional drivers of decomposition including photodegradation the abiotic decomposition of organic matter via exposure to solar radiation. Recent work in this developing field shows that photodegradation may substantially influence terrestrial C fluxes including abiotic production of carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and methane especially in arid and semi arid regions. Research has also produced contradictory results regarding controls on photodegradation. Here we summarize the state of knowledge about the role of photodegradation in litter decomposition and C cycling and investigate drivers of photodegradation across experiments using a meta analysis. Overall increasing litter exposure to solar radiation increased mass loss by 23 PeRcEnT with large variation in photodegradation rates among and within ecosystems. This variation was tied to both litter and environmental characteristics. Photodegradation increased with litter C to nitrogen (N) ratio but not with lignin content suggesting that we do not yet fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Photodegradation also increased with factors that increased solar radiation exposure (latitude and litter area to mass ratio) and decreased with mean annual precipitation. The impact of photodegradation on C (and potentially N) cycling fundamentally reshapes our thinking of decomposition as a solely biological process and requires that we define the mechanisms driving photodegradation before we can accurately represent photodegradation in global C and N models. 185:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, N limitation to primary production and other ecosystem processes is widespread. To understand the causes and distribution of N limitation we must understand the controls of biological N fixation. The physiology of this process is reasonably well characterized but our understanding of ecological controls is sparse except in a few cultivated ecosystems. We review information on the ecological controls of N fixation in free living cyanobacteria vascular plant symbioses and heterotrophic bacteria with a view toward developing improved conceptual and simulation models of ecological controls of biological N fixation. A model (Howarth . 1999) of cyanobacterial fixation in lakes (where N fixation generally increases substantially when N:P ratios are low) versus estuaries (where planktonic N fixation is rare regardless of N:P ratios) concludes that an interaction of trace element limitation and zooplankton grazing could constrain cyanobacteria in estuaries and so sustain N limitation. Similarly. a model of symbiotic N fixation on land (Vitousek and Field 1999) suggests that shade intolerance P limitation and grazing on N rich plant tissues could suppress symbiotic N fixers in late successional forest ecosystems. This congruence of results raises the question why do late successional tropical forests often contain many potentially N fixing canopy legumes while N fixers are absent from most late successional temperate and boreal forests? We suggest that relatively high N availability in lowland tropical forests permits legumes to maintain an N demanding lifestyle (McKey 1994) without always being required to pay the costs of fixing N. Overall both the few simulation models and the more numerous conceptual models of ecological controls of biological N fixation suggest that there are substantial common features across N fixing organisms and ecosystems. Despite the many groups of organisms capable of fixing N and the very different ecosystems in which the process is important we suggest that these common controls provide a foundation for the development of regional and global models that incorporate ecological controls of biological N fixation. 186:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Organic forms of nitrogen are widespread in the atmosphere and their deposition may constitute a substantive input of atmospheric N to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Recent studies have expanded the pool of available measurements and our awareness of their potential significance. Here we use these measurements to provide a coherent picture of the processes that produce both oxidized and reduced forms of organic nitrogen in the atmosphere examine how those processes are linked to human activity and how they may contribute to the N load from the atmosphere to ecosystems. We summarize and synthesize data from 41 measurements of the concentrations and fluxes of atmospheric organic nitrogen (AON). In addition we examine the contribution of reduced organic nitrogen compounds such as amino acids bacterial particulate N and oxidized compounds such as organic nitrates to deposition fluxes of AON. The percentage contribution of organic N to total N loading varies from site to site and with measurement methodology but is consistently around a third of the total N load with a median value of 30 PeRcEnT (Standard Deviation of 16 PeRcEnT). There are no indications that AON is a proportionally greater contributor to N deposition in unpolluted environments and there are not strong correlations between fluxes of nitrate and AON or ammonium and AON. Possible sources for AON include byproducts of reactions between NOx and hydrocarbons marine and terrestrial sources of reduced (amino acid) N and the long range transport of organic matter (dust pollen etc.) and bacteria. Both dust and organic nitrates such as PAN appear to play an important role in the overall flux of AON to the surface of the earth. For estimates of organic nitrate deposition we also use an atmospheric chemical transport model to evaluate the spatial distribution of fluxes and the globally integrated deposition values. Our preliminary estimate of the magnitude of global AON fluxes places the flux between 10 and 50 Tg of N per year with substantial unresolved uncertainties but clear indications that AON deposition is an important aspect of local and global atmospheric N budgets and deserves further consideration. 188:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Since the Changjiang River Huanghe River and Zhujiang River are the three major rivers in China that are flowing into the Pacific Ocean this paper addresses nitrogen budgeting source (input) and sink (output and storage) in these three river valleys and the China watershed as well. In the China watershed the anthropogenic reactive N has far exceeded the terrestrial bio fixed N in nature and human activities have significantly altered the N cycling in this region. In 1995 the total amount of anthropogenic reactive N in China reached 31.2 Tg with 22.2 Tg coming from synthetic fertilizers and 4.18 Tg from NOx emission from fossil fuel combustion and the input of recycling N amounted to 30.5 Tg consisting mainly of human and animal excrement N reflecting the intensity of the human activity. The sink of N includes N in the harvested crop denitrification and storage in agricultural soils transportation into waterbodies and volatilization of NH3. N output and storage in soil reached up to 48 53 Tg. Of this amount 14 Tg was in the harvested crops 12 Tg stored in agricultural soils 11 Tg transported into waterbodies 5 10 Tg denitrified in the soils and a limited amount exported through food feed. In this paper besides the N budget in the China watershed the N budgets and especially N transports into waterbodies in the Changjiang Huanghe and Zhujiang river valleys are estimated. 1893:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A cornerstone of our understanding of the contemporary global carbon cycle is that the terrestrial land surface is an important greenhouse gas (GHG) sink. The global land sink is estimated to be 2.6 T 1.7 Pg of C year 1 (variability T range excluding C emissions because of deforestation). Lakes impoundments and rivers are parts of the terrestrial landscape but they have not yet been included in the terrestrial GHG balance. Available data suggest however that freshwaters can be substantial sources of CO2 and CH4. Over time soil carbon reaches freshwaters by lateral hydrological transport where it can meet several fates including burial in sediments further transport to the sea or evasion to the atmosphere as CO2 or CH4. CH4 emissions may be small in terms of carbon but CH4 is a more potent GHG than CO2 over century time scales. This study indicates that global CH4 emissions expressed as CO2 equivalents correspond to at least 25 PeRcEnT of the estimated terrestrial GHG sink. CH4 can be emitted from freshwaters through several different pathways including ebullition (bubble flux from sediments) diffusive flux and plant mediated transport through emergent aquatic plants. Additional pathways may be important for hydroelectric reservoirs such as emissions upon passage through turbines and downstream of reservoirs. We compiled CH4 emission estimates from 474 freshwater ecosystems for which the emission pathways were clearly defined. By using recent data on the area and distribution of inland waters we estimate the total CH4 emission from freshwaters to be 103 Tg of CH4 year 1. Expressed as CO2 equivalents (eq) this corresponds to 0.65 Pg of C (CO2 eq) year 1 or 25 PeRcEnT of the estimated land GHGsink assuming that 1 kg of CH4 corresponds to 25 kg of CO2 over a 100 year period. Ebullition and plant flux which are both poorly represented in the data set dominate the other flux pathways that have been studied more frequently. Ebullition is most likely to be underestimated because it is episodic and not representatively captured by the usual short term measurements. Accordingly our global estimate of freshwater CH4 emissions is probably conservative. For further discussion of the results see supporting online material (SOM) text. This study indicates that CH4 emissions from freshwaters can substantially affect the global land GHG sink estimate. Moreover proper consideration of ebullition and plant mediated emission will most likely result in increased future estimates of CH4 emission. Combining the present CH4 emission estimate of 0.65 Pg of C (CO2 eq) year 1 with the most recent estimate of freshwater CO2 emissions 1.4 Pg of C (CO2 eq) year 1 together corresponding to 79 PeRcEnT of the estimated land GHG sink__it becomes clear that freshwaters are an important component of the continental GHG balance. Accordingly the terrestrial GHG sink may be smaller than currently believed and data on GHG release from inland waters are needed in future revision of net continental GHG fluxes.  189:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The eastern U.S. receives elevated rates of N deposition compared to preindustrial times yet relatively little of this N is exported in drainage waters. Net uptake of N into forest biomass and soils could account for a substantial portion of the difference between N deposition and solution exports. We quantified forest N sinks in biomass accumulation and harvest export for 16 large river basins in the eastern U.S. with two separate approaches: (1) using growth data from the USDA Forest Services Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program and (2) using a model of forest nitrogen cycling (PnET CN) linked to FIA information on forest age class structure. The model was also used to quantify N sinks in soil and dead wood and nitrate losses below the rooting zone. Both methods agreed that net growth rates were highest in the relatively young forests on the Schuylkill watershed and lowest in the cool forests of northern Maine. Across the 16 watersheds wood export removed an average of 2.7 kg N ha( 1) yr( 1) (range: 1 5 kg N ha( 1) yr( 1)) and standing stocks increased by 4.0 kg N ha( 1) yr( 1) ( 3 to 8 kg N ha( 1) yr( 1)). Together these sinks for N in woody biomass amounted to a mean of 6.7 kg N ha( 1) yr( 1) (2 9 kg N ha( 1) yr( 1)) or 73 PeRcEnT (15 115 PeRcEnT) of atmospheric N deposition. Modeled rates of net N sinks in dead wood and soil were small; soils were only a significant net sink for N during simulations of reforestation of degraded agricultural sites. Predicted losses of nitrate depended on the combined effects of N deposition and both short and long term effects of disturbance. Linking the model with forest inventory information on age class structure provided a useful step toward incorporating realistic patterns of forest disturbance status across the landscape. 1904:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human activities particularly burning fossil fuel have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Because CO2 traps heat continued emissions are expected to change global climate. The extent of this change will depend not only on the rate of emissions but also on carbon uptake by the oceans and the land. According to some models land ecosystems can sequester carbon fast enough to help to counteract CO2 emissions. Models featured in the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that increasing atmospheric CO2 alone could cause 350 to 890 Pg of carbon (1 Pg equals 1015 g) to accumulate in the terrestrial biosphere by 2100. These amounts are equivalent to 22 to 57 PeRcEnT of expected anthropogenic CO2 emissions in an intermediate emissions scenario. The models suggest that atmospheric CO2 and climate change together could cause 260 to 530 Pg of carbon to accumulate or 16 to 34 PeRcEnT of emissions. These models probably exaggerate the terrestrial biospheres potential to slow atmospheric CO2 rise. Ecosystem carbon accumulation may be constrained by nutrients particularly nitrogen through mechanisms that are not well developed in or absent from the models. How much nitrogen do the model projections require? The models distribute the future terrestrial carbon sink roughly equally between trees and soils. With no change in the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios of trees (200) and soils the CO2 only projections require 7.7 to 37.5 Pg of nitrogen; the CO2 climate projections require 2.3 to 16.9 Pg of nitrogen (see the figure). Can increasing ecosystem C:N ratios reduce the nitrogen required? Tree C:N increases with atmospheric CO2 concentration. But even allowing all the simulated increase in tree carbon to occur as wood (C:N equals 500) only slightly reduces the amount of additional nitrogen required. Soil C:N could also increase with rising atmospheric CO2 concentration allowing soil carbon accumulation without additional nitrogen. This mechanism could allow some nitrogen transfer from soil to trees lowering the nitrogen demand associated with increased tree carbon. However experimental studies show that when CO2 enrichment increases soil C:N decomposing microorganisms require more nitrogen. This effect can reduce nitrogen mineralization the main source of nitrogen for plants. It is thus unlikely that increases in soil C:N could yield large increases in ecosystem carbon stocks. With little contribution from increasing C:N the carbon uptake projections almost certainly require nitrogen accumulation. Nitrogen enters the terrestrial biosphere through atmospheric deposition and biological fixation and is mainly lost through leaching and gaseous fluxes. We have estimated high and low nitrogen fluxes for each of these mechanisms. To estimate future anthropogenic nitrogen deposition based on population growth projections we assume that per capita nitrogen deposition remains constant (low) or increases linearly to that of North America today (high). We assume that 5 PeRcEnT (low) to 10 PeRcEnT (high) of that deposited nitrogen supports increased carbon storage. We estimate biological nitrogen fixation to increase linearly by 10 PeRcEnT (low) or 45 PeRcEnT (high) with CO2 doubling. We further assume that nitrogen leaching losses are currently 36 Tg of nitrogen per year and that nitrogen leaching would decline linearly with CO2 doubling by 0 (low) to 20 PeRcEnT (high). Combining our high estimates 6.1 Pg of nitrogen could accumulate by 2100. This amount is less than is required by all CO2 only simulations and by four of the six CO2 climate simulations. Our low estimates of nitrogen accumulation yield only 1.2 Pg of nitrogen insufficient for all simulations. We have focused on nitrogen but the situation may be worse for other nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus which are less subject to human or biological control than is nitrogen fixation. Models that incorporate nutrient cycling predict much less CO2 carbon uptake than models lacking these feedbacks. The next IPCC assessment must include models taking into account these feedbacks.  190:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The feasibility of using nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate (NO3 ) for elucidating sources and transformations of riverine nitrate was evaluated in a comparative study of 16 watersheds in the northeastern U.S.A. Stream water was sampled repeatedly at the outlets of the watersheds between January and December 1999 for determining concentrations delta(15)N values and delta(18)O values of riverine nitrate. In conjunction with information about land use and nitrogen fluxes delta(15)N(nitrate) and delta(18)O(nitrate) values provided mainly information about sources of riverine nitrate. In predominantly forested watersheds riverine nitrate had mean concentrations of less than 0.4 mg NO3 N L 1 delta(15)N(nitrate) values of less than 5parts per thousand and delta(18)O(nitrate) values between 12 and 19parts per thousand. This indicates that riverine nitrate was almost exclusively derived from soil nitrification processes with potentially minor nitrate contributions from atmospheric deposition in some catchments. In watersheds with significant agricultural and urban land use. concentrations of riverine nitrate were as high as 2.6 mg NO3 N L 1 with delta(15)N(nitrate) values between 5 and 8parts per thousand 3 and delta(18)O(nitrate) values generally below 15parts per thousand. Correlations between nitrate concentrations delta(15)N(nitrate) values and N fluxes suggest that nitrate in waste water constituted a major and nitrate in manure a minor additional source of riverine nitrate. Atmospheric nitrate deposition or nitrate containing fertilizers were not a significant source of riverine nitrate in watersheds with significant agricultural and urban land use. Although complementary studies indicate that in stream denitrification was significant in all rivers the isotopic composition of riverine nitrate sampled at the Outlet of the 16 watersheds did not provide evidence for denitrification in the form of elevated delta(15)N(nitrate) and delta(18)O(nitrate) values. Relatively low isotopic enrichment factors for nitrogen and oxygen during in stream denitrification and continuous admixture of nitrate from the above described sources are thought to be responsible for this finding 191:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The human induced input of reactive N into the global biosphere has increased to approximately 150 Tg N each year and is expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The need to feed (similar to 125 Tg N) and to provide energy (similar to 25 Tg N) for the growing world population drives this trend. This increase in reactive N comes at in some instances significant costs to society through increased emissions of NOx NH3 N2O and NO3 and deposition of NOy and NHx. In the atmosphere increases in tropospheric ozone and acid deposition (NOy and NHx) have led to acidification of aquatic and soil systems and to reductions in forest and crop system production. Changes in aquatic systems as a result of nitrate leaching have led to decreased drinking water quality eutrophication hypoxia and decreases in aquatic plant diversity for example. On the other hand increased deposition of biologically available N may have increased forest biomass production and may have contributed to increased storage of atmospheric CO2 in plant and soils. Most importantly synthetic production of fertilizer N has contributed greatly to the remarkable increase in food production that has taken place during the past 50 years. The development of policy to control unwanted reactive N release is difficult because much of the reactive N release is related to food and energy production and reactive N species can be transported great distances in the atmosphere and in aquatic systems. There are many possibilities for limiting reactive N emissions from fuel combustion and in fact great strides have been made during the past decades. Reducing the introduction of new reactive N and in curtailing the movement of this N in food production is even more difficult. The particular problem comes from the fact that most of the N that is introduced into the global food production system is not converted into usable product but rather reenters the biosphere as a surplus. Global policy on N in agriculture is difficult because many countries need to increase food production to raise nutritional levels or to keep up with population growth which may require increased use of N fertilizers. Although N cycling occurs at regional and global scales policies are implemented and enforced at the national or provincial state levels. Multinational efforts to control N loss to the environment are surely needed but these efforts will require commitments from individual countries and the policy makers within those countries. 192:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The human induced input of reactive N into the global biosphere has increased to approximately 150 Tg N each year and is expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.

However selected groups of Bacteria including cyanobacteria and Archaea can utilize dinitrogen (N(2)) as an alternative N source. In the marine environment these microorganisms can have profound effects on net community production processes and can impact the coupling of C N P cycles as well as the net oceanic sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. As one component of an integrated Nitrogen Transport and Transformations project we have begun to re assess our understanding of (1) the biotic sources and rates of N(2) fixation in the worlds oceans (2) the major controls on rates of oceanic N(2) fixation (3) the significance of this N(2) fixation for the global carbon cycle and (4) the role of human activities in the alteration of oceanic N(2) fixation. Preliminary results indicate that rates of N(2) fixation especially in subtropical and tropical open ocean habitats have a major role in the global marine N budget. Iron (Fe) bioavailability appears to be an important control and is therefore critical in extrapolation to global rates of N(2) fixation. Anthropogenic perturbations may alter N(2) fixation in coastal environments through habitat destruction and eutrophication and open ocean N(2) fixation may be enhanced by warming and increased stratification of the upper water column. Global anthropogenic and climatic changes may also affect N(2) fixation rates for example by altering dust inputs  Fe) or by expansion of subtropical boundaries. Some recent estimates of global ocean N(2) fixation are in the range of 100 200 Tg N (1 2 x 10(14) g N) yr( 1) but have large uncertainties. These estimates are nearly an order of magnitude greater than historical pre 1980 estimates but approach modern estimates of oceanic denitrification. 1940:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, For the period 1980 89 we estimate a carbon sink in the coterminous United States between 0.30 and 0.58 petagrams of carbon per year (petagrams of carbon equals 10(15) grams of carbon). The net carbon flux from the atmosphere to the Land was higher 0.37 to 0.71 petagrams of carbon per year because a net flux of 0.07 to 0.13 petagrams of carbon per year was exported by rivers and commerce and returned to the atmosphere elsewhere. These Land based estimates are Larger than those from previous studies (0.08 to 0.35 petagrams of carbon per year) because of the inclusion of additional processes and revised estimates of some component fluxes. Although component estimates are uncertain about one half of the total is outside the forest sector. We also estimated the sink using atmospheric models and the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (the tracer transport inversion method). The range of results from the atmosphere based inversions contains the Land based estimates. Atmosphere and land based estimates are thus consistent within the Large ranges of uncertainty for both methods. Atmosphere based results for 1980 89 are similar to those for 1985 89 and 1990 94 indicating a relatively stable U.S. sink throughout the period. 194:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To assess the fate of the large amounts of nitrogen (N) brought into the environment by human activities we constructed N budgets for sixteen large watersheds (475 to 70 189 km(2)) in the northeastern U.S.A. These watersheds are mainly forested (48 87 PeRcEnT) but vary widely with respect to land use and population density. We combined published data and empirical and process models to set up a complete N budget for these sixteen watersheds. Atmospheric deposition fertilizer application net feed and food inputs. biological fixation river discharge wood accumulation and export changes in soil N and denitrification losses in the landscape and in rivers were considered for the period 1988 to 1992. For the whole area on average 3420 kg of N is imported annually per km(2) of land. Atmospheric N deposition N 2 fixation by plants and N imported in commercial products (fertilizers food and feed) contributed to the input in roughly equal contributions. We quantified the fate of these inputs by independent estimates of storage and loss terms except for denitrification from land which was estimated from the difference between all inputs and all other storage and loss terms. Of the total storage and losses in the watersheds about half of the N is lost in gaseous form (51 PeRcEnT largely by denitrification). Additional N is lost in riverine export (20 PeRcEnT) in food exports (6 PeRcEnT) and in wood exports (5 PeRcEnT). Change in storage of N in the watersheds in soil organic matter (9 PeRcEnT) and wood (9 PeRcEnT) accounts for the remainder of the sinks. The presence of appreciable changes in total N storage on land which we probably under rather than overestimated shows that the N budget is not in steady state so that drainage and denitrification exports of N may well increase further in the future. 1952:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Litter decomposition provides the primary source of mineral nitrogen (N) for biological activity in most terrestrial ecosystems. A 10 year decomposition experiment in 21 sites from seven biomes found that net N release from leaf litter is dominantly driven by the initial tissue N concentration and mass remaining regardless of climate edaphic conditions or biota. Arid grasslands exposed to high ultraviolet radiation were an exception where net N release was insensitive to initial N. Roots released N linearly with decomposition and exhibited little net N immobilization. We suggest that fundamental constraints on decomposer physiologies lead to predictable global scale patterns in net N release during decomposition. 195:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Watersheds of the US Geological Surveys Hydrologic Benchmark Network program were used in estimating annual yield of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions (ammonium nitrate dissolved organic N particulate N) in relation to amount of runoff elevation and watershed area. Only watersheds minimally disturbed with respect to the nitrogen cycle were used in the analysis (mostly natural vegetation cover no point Sources of N atmospheric deposition of inorganic N   10 kg ha( 1) y( 1)). Statistical analysis of the yields of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions showed that elevation and watershed area beat no significant relationship to nitrogen yield for these watersheds. The yields of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions are however strongly related to runoff (r(2) equals 0.91 for total N). Annual yield increases as runoff increases but at a rate lower than runoff; annual discharge weighted mean concentrations decline as annual runoff increases. Yields of total nitrogen and most nitrogen fractions bear a relationship to runoff that is nearly indistinguishable from a relationship that was documented previously for minimally disturbed watersheds of the American tropics. Overall the results suggest strong interlatitudinal convergence of yields and percent fractionation for nitrogen in relation to runoff. 196:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We evaluated the accuracy of six watershed models of nitrogen export in streams (kg km(2) yr( 1)) developed for use in large watersheds and representing various empirical and quasi empirical approaches described in the literature. These models differ in their methods of calibration and have varying levels of spatial resolution and process complexity which potentially affect the accuracy (bias and precision) of the model predictions of nitrogen export and source contributions to export. Using stream monitoring data and detailed estimates of the natural and cultural sources of nitrogen for 16 watersheds in the northeastern United States (drainage sizes equals 475 to 70 000 km(2)) we assessed the accuracy of the model predictions of total nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen export. The model validation included the use of an error modeling technique to identify biases caused by model deficiencies in quantifying nitrogen sources and biogeochemical processes affecting the transport of nitrogen in watersheds. Most models predicted stream nitrogen export to within 50 PeRcEnT of the measured export in a majority of the watersheds. Prediction errors were negatively correlated with cultivated land area indicating that the watershed models tended to over predict export in less agricultural and more forested watersheds and under predict in more agricultural basins. The magnitude of these biases differed appreciably among the models. Those models having more detailed descriptions of nitrogen sources land and water attenuation of nitrogen and water flow paths were found to have considerably lower bias and higher precision in their predictions of nitrogen export. 197:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Yields and retention of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NO3 NH4 ) and nitrate concentrations in surface runoff are summarized for 28 high elevation watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California and Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado. Catchments ranged in elevation from 2475 to 3603 m and from 15 to 1908 ha in area. Soil cover varied from 5 PeRcEnT to nearly 97 PeRcEnT of total catchment area. Runoff from these snow dominated catchments ranged from 315 to 1265 mm per year. In the Sierra Nevada annual volume weighted mean (AVWM) nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 13 muM (overall average 5.4 muM) and peak concentrations measured during snowmelt ranged from 1.0 to 38 muM. Nitrate levels in the Rocky Mountain watersheds were about twice those in the Sierra Nevada; average AVWM NO3 was 9.4 muM and snowmelt peaks ranged from 15 to 50 muM. Mean DIN loading to Rocky Mountain watersheds 3.6 kg ha( 1) yr( 1) was double the average measured for Sierra Nevada watersheds 1.8 kg ha( 1) yr( 1). DIN yield in the Sierra Nevada 0.69 kg ha( 1) yr( 1) was about 60 PeRcEnT that measured in the Rocky Mountains 1.1 kg ha( 1) yr( 1). Net inorganic N retention in Sierra Nevada catchments was 1.2 kg ha( 1) yr( 1) and represented about 55 PeRcEnT of annual DIN loading. DIN retention in the Rocky Mountain catchments was greater in absolute terms 2.5 kg ha( 1) yr( 1) and as a percentage of DIN loading 72 PeRcEnT. A correlation analysis using DIN yield DIN retention and surface water nitrate concentrations as dependent variables and eight environmental features (catchment elevation slope aspect roughness area runoff soil cover and DIN loading) as independent variables was conducted. For the Sierra Nevada elevation and soil cover had significant (p   0.1) Pearson product moment correlations with catchment DIN yield AVWM and peak snowmelt nitrate concentrations and DIN retention rates. Log linear regression models using soil cover as the independent variable explained 82 PeRcEnT of the variation in catchment DIN retention 92 PeRcEnT of the variability in AVWM nitrate and 85 PeRcEnT of snowmelt peak NO3 . In the Rocky Mountains soil cover was significantly (p   0.05) correlated with DIN yield AVWM NO3 and DIN retention expressed as a percentage of DIN loading (PeRcEnT DIN retention). Catchment mean slope and terrain roughness were positively correlated with steam nitrate concentrations and negatively related to PeRcEnT DIN retention. About 91 PeRcEnT of the variation in DIN yield and 79 PeRcEnT of the variability in AVWM NO3 were explained by log linear models based on soil cover. A log linear regression based on soil cover explained 90 PeRcEnT of the variation of PeRcEnT DIN retention in the Rocky Mountains. 198:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Bubbling is an important pathway of methane emissions from wetland ecosystems. However the concentration based threshold function approach in current biogeochemistry models of methane is not sufficient to represent the complex ebullition process. Here we revise an extant process based biogeochemistry model the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model into a multi substance model (CH(4) O(2) CO(2) and N(2)) to simulate methane production oxidation and transport (particularly ebullition) with different model complexities. When ebullition is modeled with a concentration based threshold function and if the inhibition effect of oxygen on methane production and the competition for oxygen between methanotrophy and heterotrophic respiration are retained the model becomes a two substance system. Ignoring the role of oxygen while still modeling ebullition with a concentration based threshold function reduces the model to a one substance system. These models were tested through a group of sensitivity analyses using data from two temperate peatland sites in Michigan. We demonstrate that only the four substance model with a pressure based ebullition algorithm is able to capture the episodic emissions induced by a sudden decrease in atmospheric pressure or by a sudden drop in water table. All models captured the retardation effect on methane efflux from an increase in surface standing water which results from the inhibition of diffusion and the increase in rhizospheric oxidation. We conclude that to more accurately account for the effects of atmospheric pressure dynamics and standing water on methane effluxes the multi substance model with a pressure based ebullition algorithm should be used in the future to quantify global wetland CH(4) emissions. Further to more accurately simulate the pore water gas concentrations and different pathways of methane transport an exponential root distribution function should be used and the phase related parameters should be treated as temperature dependent. 199:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The carbon burial in vegetated sediments ignored in past assessments of carbon burial in the ocean was evaluated using a bottom up approach derived from upscaling a compilation of published individual estimates of carbon burial in vegetated habitats (seagrass meadows salt marshes and mangrove forests) to the global level and a top down approach derived from considerations of global sediment balance and a compilation of the organic carbon content of vegeatated sediments. Up scaling of individual burial estimates values yielded a total carbon burial in vegetated habitats of 111 Tmol C y( 1). The total burial in unvegetated sediments was estimated to be 126 Tg C y( 1) resulting in a bottom up estimate of total burial in the ocean of about 244 Tg C y( 1) two fold higher than estimates of oceanic carbon burial that presently enter global carbon budgets. The organic carbon concentrations in vegetated marine sediments exceeds by 2 to 10 fold those in shelf deltaic sediments. Top down recalculation of ocean sediment budgets to account for these previously neglected organic rich sediments yields a top down carbon burial estimate of 216 Tg C y( 1) with vegetated coastal habitats contributing about 50 PeRcEnT. Even though vegetated carbon burial contributes about half of the total carbon burial in the ocean burial represents a small fraction of the net production of these ecosystems estimated at about 3388 Tg C y( 1) suggesting that bulk of the benthic net ecosystem production must support excess respiration in other compartments such as unvegetated sediments and the coastal pelagic compartment. The total excess organic carbon available to be exported to the ocean is estimated at between 1126 to 3534 Tg C y( 1) the bulk of which must be respired in the open ocean. Widespread loss of vegetated coastal habitats must have reduced carbon burial in the ocean by about 30 Tg Cy 1 identifying the destruction of these ecosystems as an important loss of CO2 sink capacity in the biosphere. 200:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The direct CO2 released by respiration of humans and domesticated animals as well as CO2 derived from the decomposition of their resulting wastes was calculated in order to ascertain the direct and indirect metabolic contribution of humanity to CO2 release. Human respiration was estimated to release 0.6 Gt C year( 1) and that of their associated domestic animals was estimated to release 1.5 Gt C year( 1) to which an indirect release of 1.0 Gt C year derived from decomposition of the organic waste and garbage produced by humans and their domestic animals must be added. These combined direct and indirect metabolic sources estimated at 3.1 Gt C year( 1) have increased 7 fold since pre industrial times and are predicted to continue to rise over the 21st century. 2073:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Reservoirs are sustainable only as long as they offer sufficient water storage space to achieve their design objectives. Life expectancy related to sedimentation is a measure of reservoir sustainability. We used data from the Army Corps of Engineers U. S. Bureau of Reclamation and U. S. Geological Survey (Reservoir Sedimentation Survey Information System II (RESIS II)) to explore the sustainability of American reservoirs. Sustainability varied by region with the longest life expectancies in New England and the Tennessee Valley and the shortest in the interior west. In the Missouri and Colorado River basins sedimentation and rates of loss of reservoir storage capacity were highly variable in time and space. In the Missouri River Basin the larger reservoirs had the longest life expectancies with some exceeding 1000 years while smaller reservoirs in the basin had the shortest life expectancies. In the Colorado River Basin at the site of Glen Canyon Dam sediment inflow varied with time declining by half beginning in 1942 because of hydroclimate and upstream geomorphic changes. Because of these changes the estimated life expectancy of Lake Powell increased from 300 to 700 years. Future surprise changes in sedimentation delivery and reservoir filling area are expected. Even though large western reservoirs were built within a limited period their demise will not be synchronous because of varying sedimentation rates. Popular literature has incorrectly emphasized the possibility of rapid synchronous loss of reservoir storage capacity and underestimated the sustainability of the water control infrastructure. 233:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,251:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,263:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A highly controversial issue in global biogeochemistry is the regulation of terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration by soil nitrogen (N) availability. This controversy translates into great uncertainty in predicting future global terrestrial C sequestration. We propose a new framework that centers on the concept of progressive N limitation (PNL) for studying the interactions between C and N in terrestrial ecosystems. In PNL available soil N becomes increasingly limiting as C and N are sequestered in long lived plant biomass and soil organic matter. Our analysis focuses on the role of PNL in regulating ecosystem responses to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration but the concept applies to any perturbation that initially causes C and N to accumulate in organic forms. This article examines conditions under which PNL may or may not constrain net primary production and C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. While the PNL centered framework has the potential to explain diverse experimental results and to help researchers integrate models and data direct tests of the PNL hypothesis remain a great challenge to the research community. 280:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Thawing permafrost and the resulting microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon (C) is one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. In this article we present an overview of the global permafrost C pool and of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high latitude inventory estimates with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost such as growing season length plant growth rates and species composition and ecosystem energy exchange. However these processes do not appear to be able to compensate for C release from thawing permafrost making it likely that the net effect of widespread permafrost thawing will be a positive feedback to a warming climate. 297:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,301:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,313:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,324:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Copper (Cu) complexation with natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) mitigates Cu bioavailability to aquatic biota by decreasing the activity of the cupric ion ( Cu2 ). However DOM is photochemically unstable. In a previous study we demonstrated that irradiation (similar to 13 days sunlight) of DOM collected from a river decreased its binding site density for Cu by 45 PeRcEnT but increased binding site density in wetland DOM by 147 PeRcEnT. Binding site densities correlated positively with ketones and aldehydes (C II groups). Herein we determined the mortality of larval fathead minnows (FHM; Pimephales promelas) as a function of Cu2 in 96 h static renewal toxicity tests without DOM. Next we calculated Cu2 in control and photooxidized DOM and then predicted mortality of larval FHM in toxicity tests. Observed mortalities agreed with predictions (r(2) equals 0.96) in treatments with lowest binding site densities and proportions of C II groups (highest Cu2 ). However treatments with 50 PeRcEnT lower Cu2 containing higher proportions of C II groups had equally high mortalities and poorer fits with predictions (r(2) approximate to 0.75) possibly indicating that Cu bound to C II groups are bioavailable. To our knowledge this study is the first to predict and then directly test the effects of DOM photooxidation on Cu toxicity. 329:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this perspective article I argue that dissolved organic carbon occupies a central role in the functioning of lake ecosystems comparable in importance to that played by nutrients. Because lakes receive so much dissolved organic carbon from the terrestrial landscape its accumulation in water bodies usually represents the largest pool of lacustrine organic matter within the water column. The transformation of even a small fraction of this external carbon by the microbial community can alter significantly the metabolic balance of lake ecosystems simultaneously releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and burying organic carbon in lake sediments. At the landscape level even if they occupy a small fraction of the landscape lakes play a surprisingly important role in the regional carbon budget particularly when considered at the appropriate temporal scale. 344:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Unique and interactive effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) temperature and water column mixing on phytoplankton abundance and community composition were quantified using regression and multivariate analysis for lakes of differing transparencies and UVR exposure regimes located at the Experimental Lakes Area in Canada. Abundance of planktonic diatoms and chrysophytes (as fucoxanthin) and total algae (as chlorophylls) were negatively correlated with UVB exposure (R(2) equals 0.57 and R(2) equals 0.64 respectively) in slightly stained lakes. In contrast concentrations of both filamentous Cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates were positively correlated with UVB levels in eutrophic and humic lakes (dissolved organic carbon  9 mg . L( 1)) (R(2) equals 0.23 and R(2) equals 0.27) whereas all algal groups were uncorrelated with UVB in oligotrophic ecosystems. Although univariate analyses suggested that surface water temperature explained more variation in algal abundance than UVB principal components analyses revealed that the two factors often covaried and could not be statistically disentangled. Instead it appears that strong UVB effects on lake algal communities occur commonly when optical and thermal properties interact to maximize exposure to high irradiances. Unexpectedly UVR could either suppress or stimulate surface algal growth depending on the precise combination of lake parameters and algal community composition. 352:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We measured surface soil (0 15 cm) C and N pools and processes inside and outside an area that had been trenched 13 years earlier in an old growth conifer forest ( 450 years) to assess the long term impacts of reduced root inputs on C and N turnover. Trenching combined with frequent clipping of understory plants was originally conducted to prevent nutrient uptake by plants as part of a study of the role of vegetation in ecosystem retention of N. Thirteen years following trenching the median values of bulk density pH total C and N concentrations annual rates of in situ net N mineralization and nitrification microbial biomass C and N microbial respiration and anaerobically mineralizable N in the trenched plot were all within the 25 75 PeRcEnT interquartile range of values found in the replicated untrenched plots. The trenched plot had higher rates of net N mineralization (41 PeRcEnT higher in October 484 PeRcEnT higher in June) and net nitrification (25 PeRcEnT higher in October and lower net NO3 immobilization in June) during laboratory incubation and a 22 PeRcEnT higher water content in October. In June soil water content in the trenched plot was about 8 PeRcEnT lower than in the untrenched plots. Our results suggest that soil C and N dynamics in these old growth forests are relatively resistant to perturbations resulting from major reductions in root input to the soil. 353:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,355:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,386:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,395:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Dense aggregations of waterfowl often caused by loss of native wetlands and increased waterfowl numbers can result in the destruction of wetland vegetation and agricultural crops increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks and decrease water quality. Problems related to water quality may be particularly severe in arid regions of the southwestern United States where water quality and quantity are contentious issues. Over 40 000 Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross Geese (Chen rossii) winter annually at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge New Mexico. Daily feeding bouts by geese move large quantities of nutrients from farm fields where they feed to managed wetlands where they roost. Using energy and mass balance models population estimates daily and seasonal migration patterns and feeding behaviors we estimated the mass and ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus of nutrients loaded by geese into the wetlands of the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. Loading rates peaked in late November 1995 at more than 300 kg nitrogen per day and over 30 kg phosphorus per day. As feeding behaviors changed through the winter and bird densities declined loading rates fell. Our estimates suggest that in the winter of 1995 1996 bird borne nutrients supplied nearly 40 PeRcEnT of the nitrogen and 75 PeRcEnT of the phosphorus entering the primary wetland used for geese roosting. High loading rates by geese are a consequence of their colonial roosting behavior; over 90 PeRcEnT of the geese roost on 10 PeRcEnT of the wetland area. The effects of nutrient loading could be reduced by increasing flushing rates or dispersal of roosting waterfowl. The loss of natural wetlands however limits options for expanding wetland area available to waterfowl and it may be difficult to increase flushing rates in this arid region. Thus management of waterfowl and the nutrients they move will continue to be an important issue for wetlands of wildlife refuges. 39:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,402:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,408:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,451:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,471:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,50:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Classic resource competition theory typically treats resource supply rates as independent; however nutrient supplies can be affected by plants indirectly with important consequences for model predictions. We demonstrate this general phenomenon by using a model in which competition for nitrogen is mediated by soil moisture with competitive outcomes including coexistence and multiple stable states as well as competitive exclusion. In the model soil moisture regulates nitrogen availability through soil moisture dependence of microbial processes leaching and plant uptake. By affecting water availability plants also indirectly affect nitrogen availability and may therefore alter the competitive outcome. Exotic annual species from the Mediterranean have displaced much of the native perennial grasses in California. Nitrogen and water have been shown to be potentially limiting in this system. We parameterize the model for a Californian grassland and show that soil moisture mediated competition for nitrogen can explain the annual species dominance in drier areas with coexistence expected in wetter regions. These results are concordant with larger biogeographic patterns of grassland invasion in the Pacific states of the United States in which annual grasses have invaded most of the hot dry grasslands in California but perennial grasses dominate the moister prairies of northern California Oregon and Washington. 517:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Current remote sensing technologies are effective tools for contributing to the estimation of terrestrial carbon stocks and carbon stock changes. This paper provides an overview of information requirements sensor capabilities and limitations and analysis approaches for the use of remotely sensed data in the generation of tropical carbon sequestration monitoring systems. While it is evident that remotely sensed data have tremendous utility for monitoring carbon stock changes it is important to be aware of their limitations. Three critical limitations are: (1) the definition of methods and algorithms to accurately estimate forest age (2) the provision of techniques that can yield accurate estimation of deforestation rates in both tropical dry and wet forest environments and (3) the strong need to develop new approaches to link biophysical variables (e. g. leaf area index) to spectral reflectance to support spatially distributed carbon sequestration models. The validity of final estimates of carbon and carbon stock changes rests on complex issues at several levels from the data themselves to the analysis interpretation and validation of the data. Consideration of these issues as well as the need for sound project planning and development within budget constraints will be important in the development of carbon stock monitoring programs in the tropics. 523:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,550:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,557:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The extent and consequences of global land cover and land use change are increasingly apparent. One consequence not so apparent is the altered structure of plants belowground. This paper examines such belowground changes emphasizing the interaction of altered root distributions with other factors and their treatment in models. Shifts of woody and herbaceous vegetation with deforestation afforestation and woody plant encroachment typically alter the depth and distribution of plant rests influencing soil nutrients the water balance and net primary productivity (NPP). For example our analysis of global soil data sets shows that the major plant nutrients C N P and K are more shallowly distributed than are Ca Mg and Na but patterns for each element vary with the dominant vegetation type. After controlling for climate soil C and N are distributed more deeply in arid shrublands than in arid grasslands and subhumid forests have shallower nutrient distributions than do subhumid grasslands. Consequently changes in vegetation may influence the distribution of soil carbon and nutrients over time (perhaps decades to centuries). Shifts in the water balance are typically much more rapid. Catchment studies indicate that the water yield decreases 25 40 mm for each 10 PeRcEnT increase in tree cover and increases in transpiration of water taken up by deep roots may account for as much as 50 PeRcEnT of observed responses. Because models are increasingly important for predicting the consequences of vegetation change we discuss the treatment of belowground processes and how different treatments affect model outputs. Whether models are parameterized by biome or plant life form (or neither) use single or multiple soil layers or include N and water limitation will all affect predicted outcomes. Acknowledging and understanding such differences should help constrain predictions of vegetation change. 562:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The three objectives of this paper were: to summarize net primary production (NPP) and carbon allocation patterns for boreal forests to examine relationships between climatic and biological variables and NPP and to examine carbon allocation coefficients for all boreal forests or types of boreal forests that can be used to estimate NPP from easily measured components of NPP. Twenty four Class I stands (complete NPP budgets) and 45 Class II boreal forest stands (aboveground NPP NPPA and budget only) were identified. The geographic distribution of the Class I stands was not uniform 46 PeRcEnT of the stands were from two studies in North America and only one stand was from the important larch forests of Eurasia. Total (above and belowground) net primary production (NPPT) ranged from 52 to 868 g C .m( 2 .)yr( 1) and averaged 424 g C .m( 2). yr( 1). NPPA was consistently larger for deciduous than for evergreen boreal forests in each of the major boreal regions especially for boreal forests in Alaska. Belowground net primary production:total net primary production (NPPB : NPPT) ratios were consistently larger for evergreen (0.36) than deciduous (0.19) boreal forests. NPP of different aged stands in age sequence varied from 44 PeRcEnT to 77 PeRcEnT a magnitude equal to or greater than that of climatic factors or vegetation type. NPP and NPPA were positively correlated (r(2) equals 0.66 0.68) to mean annual aboveground increment for Class I stands and this empirical relationship explained 81 PeRcEnT of the observed variation of NPPA for Class II stands. These robust relationships provide an approach for increasing the number and spatial coverage of boreal forest NPP data needed to evaluate NPP estimates from ecosystem models. Notable deficiencies of boreal forest NPP data were ground layer vegetation and belowground NPP data NPP data for boreal forest age sequences and NPP data for boreal larch ecosystems in Eurasia. 565:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There are pressing reasons for developing a better understanding of net primary production (NPP) in the worlds forests. These ecosystems play a large role in the worlds carbon budget and their dynamics which are likely to be responding to global changes in climate and atmospheric composition have major economic implications and impacts on global biodiversity Although there is a long history of forest NPP studies in the ecological literature current understanding of ecosystem level production remains limited Forest NPP cannot be directly measured; it must be approached by indirect methods. To date field measurements have been largely restricted to a few aspects of NPP; methods are still lacking for field assessment of others and past studies have involved confusion about the types of measurements needed. As a result existing field based estimates of forest NPP are likely to be significant underestimates. In this paper we provide a conceptual framework to guide efforts toward improved estimates of forest NPP. We define the quantity NPP as the summed classes of organic material that should be measured or estimated in field studies for an estimate of total NPP. We discuss the above and belowground components of NPP and the available methods for measuring them in the field We then assess the implications of the limitations of past studies for current understanding of NPP in forest ecosystems discuss how field NPP measurements can be used to complement tower based studies of forest carbon flux and recommend design criteria for future field studies of forest NPP. 566:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is general agreement that terrestrial systems in the Northern Hemisphere provide a significant sink for atmospheric CO2; however estimates of the magnitude and distribution of this sink vary greatly. National forest inventories provide strong measuretment based constraints on the magnitude of net forest carbon uptake. We brought together forest sector C budgets for Canada the United States Europe Russia and China that were derived from forest inventory information allometric relationships and supplementary data sets and models. Together these suggest that northern forests and woodlands provided a total sink for 0.6 0.7 Pg of C per year (1 Pg equals 10(15) g) during the early 1990s consisting of 0.21 Pg C yr in living biomass 0.08 Pg C yr in forest products 0.15 Pg C yr in dead wood and 0.13 Pg C yr in the forest floor and soil organic matter. Estimates of changes in soil C pools have improved but remain the least certain terms of the budgets. Over 80 PeRcEnT of the estimated sink occurred in one third of the forest area in temperate regions affected by fire suppression agricultural abandonment and plantation forestry. Growth in boreal regions was offset by fire and other disturbances that vary considerably from year to year. Comparison with atmospheric inversions suggests significant land C sinks may occur outside the forest sector. 585:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A global unified metamodel of the biosphere (GUMBO) was developed to simulate the integrated earth system and assess the dynamics and values of ecosystem services. It is a metamodel in that it represents a synthesis and a simplification of several existing dynamic global models in both the natural and social sciences at an intermediate level of complexity. The current version of the model contains 234 state variables 930 variables total and 1715 parameters. GUMBO is the first global model to include the dynamic feedbacks among human technology economic production and welfare and ecosystem goods and services within the dynamic earth system. GUMBO includes modules to simulate carbon water and nutrient fluxes through the Atmosphere Lithosphere Hydrosphere and Biosphere of the global system. Social and economic dynamics are simulated within the Anthroposphere. GUMBO links these five spheres across eleven biomes which together encompass the entire surface of the planet. The dynamics of eleven major ecosystem goods and services for each of the biomes are simulated and evaluated. Historical calibrations from 1900 to 2000 for 14 key variables for which quantitative time series data was available produced an average R 2 of 0.922. A range of future scenarios representing different assumptions about future technological change investment strategies and other factors have been simulated. The relative value of ecosystem services in terms of their contribution to supporting both conventional economic production and human well being more broadly defined were estimated under each scenario and preliminary conclusions drawn. The value of global ecosystem services was estimated to be about 4.5 times the value of Gross World Product (GWP) in the year 2000 using this approach. The model can be downloaded and run on the average PC to allow users to explore for themselves the complex dynamics of the system and the full range of policy assumptions and scenarios. 601:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,620:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Litter decomposition is an important process in the global carbon cycle. It accounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in formation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest terrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks to climate change because it is a climate dependent process. To investigate the global patterns of litter decomposition we developed a description of this process and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar litter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from approximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model called Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the effects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little systematic error over the first 10 decomposition years using only initial litter chemistry air temperature and precipitation as input variables. Illustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates our example calculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68 PeRcEnT of its initial mass still remaining after 2 decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous litter had only 15 PeRcEnT remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates a direct result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model varied according to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions and ranged from 2 PeRcEnT in tundra to 4 PeRcEnT in the tropics. This reliability was adequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences in litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as statistically significant. 638:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Studies in global plant biogeography have almost exclusively analyzed relationships of abiotic and biotic factors with the distribution and structure of vegetation aboveground. The goal of this study was to extend such analyses to the belowground structure of vegetation by determining the biotic and abiotic factors that influence vertical root distributions in them soil including soil climate and plant properties. The analysis used a database of vertical root profiles from the literature with 475 profiles from 209 geographic locations. Since most profiles were not sampled to the maximum rooting depth several techniques were used to estimate the amount of roots at greater depths to a maximum of 3 in in some systems. The accuracy of extrapolations was tested using a subset of deeply ( 2 m) sampled or completely sampled profiles. Vertical root distributions for each profile were characterized by the interpolated 50 PeRcEnT and 95 PeRcEnT rooting depths (the depths above which 50 PeRcEnT or 95 PeRcEnT of all roots were located). General linear models incorporating plant life form dominance climate and soil variables explained as much as 50 PeRcEnT of the variance in rooting depths for various biomes and life forms. Annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation together accounted for the largest proportion of the variance (12 16 PeRcEnT globally and 38 PeRcEnT in some systems). Mean 95 PeRcEnT rooting depths increased with decreasing latitude from 80 degrees to 30 degrees but showed no clear trend in the tropics. Annual PET annual precipitation and length of the warm season were all positively correlated with rooting depths. Rooting depths in tropical vegetation were only weakly correlated with climatic variables but were strongly correlated with sampling depths suggesting that even after extrapolation sampling depths there were often insufficient to characterize root profiles. Globally  90 PeRcEnT of all profiles had at least 50 PeRcEnT of all roots in the upper 0.3 m of the soil profile (including organic horizons) and 95 PeRcEnT of all roots in the upper 2 m. Deeper rooting depths were mainly found in water limited ecosystems. Deeper 95 PeRcEnT rooting depths were also found for shrublands compared to grasslands in sandy soils vs. clay or loam soils and in systems with relatively shallow organic horizons compared with deeper organic horizons. 670:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological communities are frequently exposed to environmental changes that cause measurable responses in properties of the community (hereafter called environmental drivers). Predicting how communities respond to changing environmental drivers is a fundamental goal of ecology. Making predictions however. can be very difficult particularly when multiple environmental drivers change simultaneously and there are interactions among the drivers. We investigated the effects of the interaction between changes in nutrient loading and changes in colored dissolved organic matter (measured as dissolved organic carbon. DOC) on the dynamics of phytoplankton communities over a 7 yr period. In 1991 Long Lake a small seepage lake in northern Michigan was divided vertically from sediment surface to water surface with plastic curtains as part of a whole lake experiment. The accompanying changes in hydrology led to increases in DOC concentration in one of the basins. Nutrients were added to both basins from 1993 to 1997 causing dramatic changes in phytoplankton community composition. We used multivariate autoregressive models to help interpret the patterns of phytoplankton community composition observed during the experiment. DOC and nutrient addition had diverse effects on phytoplankton: some taxonomic and morphological groups were directly affected by the changes in DOC and nutrients. whereas other groups experienced indirect effects via their interactions with groups that were directly affected. Model results suggest that there was an interaction between the effects of DOC and nutrients for many groups of phytoplankton Such that differences in DOC concentration accounted for differences between basins in response to nutrient addition. The effects of DOC can be explained by changes in physical structure  thermocline depth and transparency) and water chemistry  pH) that accompanied changes in DOC concentration. The interaction between DOC and nutrients suggests that predicting community responses to multiple drivers cannot be achieved by simply adding up the effects of single drivers. 672:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the major nitrogen (N) input in many terrestrial ecosystems yet we know little about the mechanisms and feedbacks that control this process in natural ecosystems. We here examine BNF in four taxonomically and ecologically different groups over the course of forest ecosystem development. At nine sites along the Franz Josef soil chronosequence (South Westland New Zealand) that range in age from 7 to 120 000 yr old we quantified BNF from the symbiotic plant Coriaria arborea cyanolichens (primarily Pseudocyphellaria spp.) bryophytes (many species) and heterotrophic bacteria in leaf litter. We specifically examined whether these groups could act as   nitrostats at the ecosystem level turning BNF on when N is scarce (early in primary succession) and off when N is plentiful (later in succession and retrogression). Coriaria was abundant and actively. xing (similar to 11 kg N.ha( 1).yr( 1)) in the youngest and most N poor site (7 yr old) consistent with nitrostat dynamics. Coriaria maintained high BNF rates independent of soil N availability however until it was excluded from the community after a single generation. We infer that Coriaria is an obligate N fixer and that the nitrostat feedback is mechanistically governed by species replacement at the community level rather than down regulation of BNF at the physiological scale. Biological nitrogen fixation inputs from lichens (means of 0 2 kg N.ha( 1).yr( 1)) bryophytes (0.7 10 kg N.ha( 1).yr( 1)) and litter (1 2 kg N.ha( 1).yr( 1)) were driven primarily by changes in density which peaked at intermediate aged sites (and increased with soil N availability) for both lichens and bryophytes and grew monotonically with soil age (but did not change with soil N) for litter. This non nitrostatic link between soil N availability and lichen bryophyte BNF likely stems from increased tree biomass in more fertile sites which increases epiphytic moisture conditions and habitable surface area. This apparent positive feedback could produce N rich conditions. 691:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Effects of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition and the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to store carbon (C) depend in part on the amount of N retained in the system and its partitioning among plant and soil pools. We conducted a meta analysis of studies at 48 sites across four continents that used enriched N 15 isotope tracers in order to synthesize information about total ecosystem N retention  total ecosystem N 15 recovery in plant and soil pools) across natural systems and N partitioning among ecosystem pools. The greatest recoveries of ecosystem N 15 tracer occurred in shrublands (mean 89.5 PeRcEnT) and wetlands (84.8 PeRcEnT) followed by forests (74.9 PeRcEnT) and grasslands (51.8 PeRcEnT). In the short term ( 1 week after N 15 tracer application) total ecosystem N 15 recovery was negatively correlated with fine root and soil N 15 natural abundance and organic soil C and N concentration but was positively correlated with mean annual temperature and mineral soil C:N. In the longer term (3 18 months after N 15 tracer application) total ecosystem N 15 retention was negatively correlated with foliar natural abundance N 15 but was positively correlated with mineral soil C and N concentration and C:N showing that plant and soil natural abundance N 15 and soil C:N are good indicators of total ecosystem N retention. Foliar N concentration was not significantly related to ecosystem N 15 tracer recovery suggesting that plant N status is not a good predictor of total ecosystem N retention. Because the largest ecosystem sinks for N 15 tracer were below ground in forests shrublands and grasslands we conclude that growth enhancement and potential for increased C storage in aboveground biomass from atmospheric N deposition is likely to be modest in these ecosystems. Total ecosystem N 15 recovery decreased with N fertilization with an apparent threshold fertilization rate of 46 kg N.ha( 1).yr( 1) above which most ecosystems showed net losses of applied N 15 tracer in response to N fertilizer addition. 697:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fine roots are an important source and sink for nutrients in terrestrial biogeochemistry. We examined the following hypotheses for fine root nutrients by analyzing data from 56 published studies: (1) that there is a general inverse relationship of fine root nutrient concentrations with root diameter and (2) that retranslocation of nutrients out of fine roots is minimal. We analyzed nutrient concentrations of roots less than or equal to 5 mm in diameter as a function of root diameter and root status (live dead and undifferentiated) including a comparison for coniferous and broad leaved trees. For fine roots  2 mm in diameter average C:N and C:N:P ratios were 43:1 and 522:12:1 significantly narrower than for 2 5 mm roots (79:1 and 920:12:1). Live roots  2 mm in diameter contained significantly more N P and Mg and less C than did roots 2 5 mm in diameter but no significant differences were observed for K or Ca. Mean N and P concentrations were 11.0 and 0.9 g kg respectively for live roots  2 mm diameter compared to 6.5 and 0.6 g kg in roots 2 5 mm in diameter. Mean N concentrations in live and dead fine roots were identical and may imply little retranslocation of root N with senescence but conflicting evidence from Ca:N ratios highlights the need for further research. These results have practical implications for various ecological methods and for the representation of roots in biogeochemical models. 721:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Net primary production (NPP) the difference between CO2 fixed by photosynthesis and CO2 lost to autotrophic respiration is one of the most important components of the carbon cycle. Our goal was to develop a simple regression model to estimate global NPP using climate and land cover data. Approximately 5600 global data points with observed mean annual NPP land cover class precipitation and temperature were compiled. Precipitation was better correlated with NPP than temperature and it explained much more of the variability in mean annual NPP for grass or shrub dominated systems (r(2) equals 0.68) than for tree dominated systems (r(2) equals 0.39). For a given precipitation level tree dominated systems had significantly higher NPP (similar to 100 150 g C center dot m( 2)center dot yr( 1)) than non tree dominated systems. Consequently previous empirical models developed to predict NPP based on precipitation and temperature (e. g. the Miami model) tended to overestimate NPP for non tree dominated systems. Our new model developed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (the NCEAS model) predicts NPP for tree dominated systems based on precipitation and temperature; but for non tree dominated systems NPP is solely a function of precipitation because including a temperature function increased model error for these systems. Lower NPP in non tree dominated systems is likely related to decreased water and nutrient use efficiency and higher nutrient loss rates from more frequent. re disturbances. Late 20th century aboveground and total NPP for global potential native vegetation using the NCEAS model are estimated to be similar to 28 Pg and similar to 46 Pg C yr respectively. The NCEAS model estimated an similar to 13 PeRcEnT increase in global total NPP for potential vegetation from 1901 to 2000 based on changing precipitation and temperature patterns. 754:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The capability of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon (C) plays a critical role in regulating future climatic change yet depends on nitrogen (N) availability. To predict long term ecosystem C storage it is essential to examine whether soil N becomes progressively limiting as C and N are sequestered in long lived plant biomass and soil organic matter. A critical parameter to indicate the long term progressive N limitation (PNL) is net change in ecosystem N content in association with C accumulation in plant and soil pools under elevated CO We compiled data from 104 published papers that study C and N dynamics at ambient and elevated CO2 The compiled database contains C contents N contents and C:N ratio in various plant and soil pools and root:shoot ratio. Averaged C and N pool sizes in plant and soil all significantly increase at elevated CO2 in comparison to those at ambient CO2 ranging from a 5 PeRcEnT increase in shoot N content to a 32 PeRcEnT increase in root C content. The C and N contents in litter pools are consistently higher in elevated than ambient CO2 among all the surveyed studies whereas C and N contents in the other pools increase in some studies and decrease in other studies. The high variability in CO induced changes in C and N pool sizes results from diverse responses of various C and N processes to elevated CO2. Averaged C:N ratios are higher by 3 PeRcEnT in litter and soil pools and 11 PeRcEnT in root and shoot pools at elevated relative to ambient CO2 Elevated CO2 slightly increases root:shoot ratio. The net N accumulation in plant and soil pools at least helps prevent complete down regulation of and likely supports long term CO2 stimulation of C sequestration. The concomitant C and N accumulations in response to rising atmospheric CO2 may reflect intrinsic nature of ecosystem development as revealed before by studies of succession over hundreds to millions of years. 757:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The depth of the well mixed surface layer of lakes and oceans fundamentally affects phytoplankton populations. Specific nutrient supply specific algal production and specific sinking losses all decrease with increasing mixing depth. I use a dynamical model to investigate how phytoplankton biomass light availability and the distribution Of nutrients among various pools vary along a mixing depth gradient and how the relationships of these variables to mixing depth depend on algal sinking velocity abiotic light absorbents nutrient enrichment and the mode of nutrient supply (closed system with recycling vs. open system with external input). If phytoplankton is dominated by sinking algae the primary causes of biomass limitation shift with increasing mixing depth from sinking loss limitation to nutrient limitation to light limitation. Consequently algal biomass in the mixed layer (expressed per volume or area) and sedimented nutrients are unimodally related to mixing depth whereas dissolved inorganic and total water column nutrients show the inverse pattern. Compared to closed systems the maximum in the biomass concentration mixing depth relationship occurs at much shallower depths in open systems without recycling of sedimented nutrients (such as mixed surface layers on top of stratified water columns). With increased algal sinking velocity algal biomass decreases and light penetration and dissolved nutrients both increase whereas sedimented and total water column nutrients may increase or decrease. Increased abiotic turbidity reduces light penetration algal biomass and sedimented nutrients but increases dissolved and total water column nutrients. Finally with nutrient enrichment algal biomass and all nutrient compartments increase whereas light penetration decreases. I use a graphical isocline approach to show that increasing external light supply decreasing abiotic turbidity and decreasing mixing depth represent three conceptually different forms of enrichment with light. Of those decreasing abiotic turbidity is conceptually similar to enrichment with a mineral nutrient. 769:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers surface grazing snails and filter feeding mussels to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then using data from 25 north temperate lakes. I evaluate how delta(15)N and delta(13)C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature I show that the mean trophic fractionation of delta(15)N is 3.4parts per thousand (1 SD equals 1parts per thousand) and of delta(13)C is 0.4parts per thousand (1 SD equals 1.3parts per thousand) and that both even though variable are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of delta(15)N moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of delta(13)C when delta(13)C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology. 874:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Rates of ecosystem recovery following disturbance affect many ecological processes including carbon cycling in the biosphere. Here we present a model that predicts the temperature dependence of the biomass accumulation rate following disturbances in forests. Model predictions are derived based on allometric and biochemical principles that govern plant energetics and are tested using a global database of 91 studies of secondary succession compiled from the literature. The rate of biomass accumulation during secondary succession increases with average growing season temperature as predicted based on the biochemical kinetics of photosynthesis in chloroplasts. In addition the rate of biomass accumulation is greater in angiosperm dominated communities than in gymnosperm dominated ones and greater in plantations than in naturally regenerating stands. By linking the temperature dependence of photosynthesis to the rate of whole ecosystem biomass accumulation during secondary succession our model and results provide one example of how emergent ecosystem level rate processes can be predicted based on the kinetics of individual metabolic rate. 887:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Synergistic interactions between multiple limiting resources are common highlighting the importance of co limitation as a constraint on primary production. Our concept of resource limitation has shifted over the past two decades from an earlier paradigm of single resource limitation towards concepts of co limitation by multiple resources which are predicted by various theories. Herein we summarise multiple resource limitation responses in plant communities using a dataset of 641 studies that applied factorial addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in freshwater marine and terrestrial systems. We found that more than half of the studies displayed some type of synergistic response to N and P addition. We found support for strict definitions of co limitation in 28 PeRcEnT of the studies: community biomass responded to only combined N and P addition or to both N and P when added separately. Our results highlight the importance of interactions between N and P in regulating primary producer community biomass and point to the need for future studies that address the multiple mechanisms that could lead to different types of co limitation. 889:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The cycles of the key nutrient elements nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) have been massively altered by anthropogenic activities. Thus it is essential to understand how photosynthetic production across diverse ecosystems is or is not limited by N and P. Via a large scale meta analysis of experimental enrichments we show that P limitation is equally strong across these major habitats and that N and P limitation are equivalent within both terrestrial and freshwater systems. Furthermore simultaneous N and P enrichment produces strongly positive synergistic responses in all three environments. Thus contrary to some prevailing paradigms freshwater marine and terrestrial ecosystems are surprisingly similar in terms of N and P limitation. 913:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tropical rain forests play a dominant role in global biosphere atmosphere CO(2) exchange. Although climate and nutrient availability regulate net primary production (NPP) and decomposition in all terrestrial ecosystems the nature and extent of such controls in tropical forests remain poorly resolved. We conducted a meta analysis of carbon nutrient climate relationships in 113 sites across the tropical forest biome. Our analyses showed that mean annual temperature was the strongest predictor of aboveground NPP (ANPP) across all tropical forests but this relationship was driven by distinct temperature differences between upland and lowland forests. Within lowland forests (  1000 m) a regression tree analysis revealed that foliar and soil based measurements of phosphorus (P) were the only variables that explained a significant proportion of the variation in ANPP although the relationships were weak. However foliar P foliar nitrogen (N) litter decomposition rate (k) soil N and soil respiration were all directly related with total surface (0 10 cm) soil P concentrations. Our analysis provides some evidence that P availability regulates NPP and other ecosystem processes in lowland tropical forests but more importantly underscores the need for a series of large scale nutrient manipulations especially in lowland forests to elucidate the most important nutrient interactions and controls. 916:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We assess the importance of anthropogenic land use altered productivity and species invasions for observed productivity richness relationships in California. To this end we model net primary productivity (NPP) c. 1750 AD and at present (1982 1999) and map native and exotic vascular plant richness for 230 subecoregions. NPP has increased up to 105 PeRcEnT in semi arid areas and decreased up to 48 PeRcEnT in coastal urbanized areas. Exotic invasions have increased local species diversity up to 15 PeRcEnT. Human activities have reinforced historical gradients in species richness but reduced the spatial heterogeneity of NPP. Structural equation modelling suggests that prior to European settlement NPP and richness were primarily controlled by precipitation and other abiotic variables with NPP mediating richness. Abiotic variables remain the strongest predictors of present NPP and richness but intermodel comparisons indicate a significant anthropogenic impact upon statewide distributions of NPP and richness. Exotic and native species each positively correlate to NPP after controlling for other variables which may help explain recent reports of positively associated native and exotic richness. 938:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earths surface area inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes rivers and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange sediment accumulation and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources on the order of 1.9 Pg C y( 1) from the terrestrial landscape of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y( 1) is delivered to the oceans roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further the inclusion of inland freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage oxidation and transport of terrestrial C and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described. 943:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Grasslands are globally widespread and capable of storing large amounts of carbon (C) in soils and are generally experiencing increasing atmospheric CO2 nitrogen (N) deposition and biodiversity losses. To better understand whether grasslands will act as C sources or sinks in the future we measured microbial respiration in long term laboratory incubations of soils collected from a grassland field experiment after 9 years of factorial treatment of atmospheric CO2 N deposition and plant species richness on a deep and uniformly sandy soil. We fit microbial soil respiration rates to three pool models of soil C cycling to separate treatment effects on decomposition and pool sizes of fast slow and resistant C pools. Elevated CO2 decreased the mean residence time (MRT) of slow C pools without affecting their pool size. Decreasing diversity reduced the size and MRT of fast C pools (comparing monocultures to plots planted with 16 species) but increased the slow pool MRT. N additions increased the size of the resistant pool. These effects of CO2 N and species richness treatments were largely due to plant biomass differences between the treatments. We found no significant interactions among treatments. These results suggest that C sequestration in sandy grassland soils may not be strongly influenced by elevated CO2 or species losses. However high N deposition may increase the amount of resistant C in these grasslands which could contribute to increased C sequestration. 944:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human activity is drastically altering global nitrogen (N) availability. The extent to which ecosystems absorb additional N and with it additional CO(2) depends on whether net primary production (NPP) is N limited so it is important to understand conditions under which N can limit NPP. Here I use a general dynamical model to show that N limitation at steady state such as in old growth forests depends on the balance of biotically controllable versus uncontrollable N inputs and losses. Steady state N limitation is only possible when uncontrollable inputs (for example atmospheric deposition) exceed controllable losses (for example leaching of plant available soil N) which is the same as when uncontrollable losses (for example leaching of plant unavailable soil N) exceed controllable inputs (biological N fixation). These basic results are robust to many model details such as the number of plant unavailable soil N pools and the number and type of N fixers. Empirical data from old growth tropical (Hawaii) and temperate (Oregon Washington Chile) forests support the model insights. Practically this means that any N fixer symbiotic or not could overcome ecosystem N limitation so understanding N limitation requires understanding controls on all N fixers. Further comparing losses of plant available N to abiotic inputs could offer a rapid diagnosis of whether ecosystems can be N limited although the applicability of this result is constrained to ecosystems with a steady state N cycle such as old growth forests largely devoid of disturbance. 950:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Rates and reactions of biogeochemical processes vary in space and time to produce both hot spots and hot moments of elemental cycling. We define biogeochemical hot spots as patches that show disproportionately high reaction rates relative to the surrounding matrix whereas hot moments are defined as short periods of time that exhibit disproportionately high reaction rates relative to longer intervening time periods. As has been appreciated by ecologists for decades hot spot and hot moment activity is often enhanced at terrestrial aquatic interfaces. Using examples from the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles we show that hot spots occur where hydrological flowpaths converge with substrates or other flowpaths containing complementary or missing reactants. Hot moments occur when episodic hydrological flowpaths reactivate and or mobilize accumulated reactants. By focusing on the delivery of specific missing reactants via hydrologic flowpaths we can forge a better mechanistic understanding of the factors that create hot spots and hot moments. Such a mechanistic understanding is necessary so that biogeochemical hot spots can be identified at broader spatiotemporal scales and factored into quantitative models. We specifically recommend that resource managers incorporate both natural and artificially created biogeochemical hot spots into their plans for water quality management. Finally we emphasize the needs for further research to assess the potential importance of hot spot and hot moment phenomena in the cycling of different bioactive elements improve our ability to predict their occurrence assess their importance in landscape biogeochemistry and evaluate their utility as tools for resource management. 951:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent parallel developments in the study of freshwater and marine ecosystems have provided evidence that net heterotrophic systems (those in which respiratory organic matter destruction exeeds photosynthetic production) are more prevalent than hitherto believed including most rivers oligo to mesotrophic lakes and some oligotrophic regions of the ocean. In parallel these aquatic ecosystems have been shown to act as CO2 sources to the atmosphere as expected from the heterotrophic nature of the communities they contain. The prevalence of net heterotrophic aquatic ecosystems indicates that they must receive significant inputs of organic carbon from adjacent ecosystems assigning an important role to the lateral exchanges of carbon between land and aquatic ecosystems between coastal and open ocean ecosystems as well as internal redistribution within large or complex aquatic ecosystems in determining their metabolic status and the gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. The examination of the carbon budget of ecosystems requires therefore an integrative approach that accounts for exchanges between compartments often studied in isolation. These recent findings conform a new paradigm of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and the metabolic connectivity between ecosystems in the biosphere. 953:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The influence of inland water bodies on the global carbon cycle and the great potential for long term carbon burial in them is an important component of global limnology. We used paleolimnological methods to estimate changes in carbon burial rates through time in a suite of natural lakes in the US state of Iowa which has watersheds that have been heavily modified over the last 150 years. Our results show increasing carbon burial for all lakes in our study as agriculture intensified. Our estimates of carbon burial rates before land clearance are similar to the published worldwide averages for nutrient poor lakes. In nearly all the cases burial rates increased to very high levels (up to 200 g C m( 2) y( 1)) following agricultural development. These results support the idea that the increased autochthonous and allochthonous carbon flux related to anthropogenic change leads to higher rates of carbon burial. Further these results imply that the fraction of global carbon buried by lakes will be increasingly important in the future if worldwide trends in anthropogenic eutrophication continue. 957:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding of general ecosystem principles may be improved by comparing disparate ecosystems. We compared nutrient cycling in lakes and streams to evaluate whether contrasts in hydrologic properties lead to different controls and different rates of internal nutrient cycling. Our primary focus was nutrient cycling that results in increased productivity so we quantified nutrient cycling by defining the recycling ratio (rho) as the number of times a nutrient molecule is sequestered by producers before export. An analytic model of nutrient cycling predicted that in lakes rho is governed by the processes that promote the mineralization and retard the sedimentation of particulate bound nutrients whereas in streams rho is governed by processes that promote the uptake and retard the export of dissolved nutrients. These differences were the consequence of contrast between lakes and streams in the mass specific export rates (mass exported standing stock( 1) . time( 1)) of dissolved and particulate nutrients. Although rho is calculated from readily measured ecosystem variables we found very few published data sets that provided the necessary data for a given ecosystem. We calculated and compared rho in two well studied P limited ecosystems Peter Lake and West Fork Walker Branch (WFWB). When ecosystems were scaled so that water residence time was equal between these two ecosystems rho was three orders of magnitude greater in WFWB. However when we scaled by P residence time rho was nearly equal between these two ecosystems. This suggests broad similarities in rho across ecosystem types when ecosystem boundaries are defined so that turnover times of limiting nutrients are the same. 96:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,982:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With the analytical tool Frankfurt Harvested Wood Products Model FPM the carbon stocks and carbon stock changes of Harvested Wood Products HWP either in USE or in LANDFILLS L F have been evaluated each separately from the readily available statistical data base of the FAO FAOSTAT on the wood commodities:   Sawnwood and Wood based Panels SWP   and the paper commodities   Paper and Paperboard PAP  . The focus was on the newly founded Asia Pacific Partnership countries for Clean Development and Climate (in short AP6) including Canada which wants to join the AP6 in relation to the countries of the European Union EU 25. It could be shown that the stocks and stock changes of the HWP in USE follow a simple algorithm of the annual consumption or production and their mean annual growth for the categories SWP and PAP provided the mean residence times of the HWP in USE can be estimated. With the information on the fraction of residues entering the landfills and their estimated residence times an equivalent simple expression has been derived for stocks and stock changes of the HWP in LANDFILLS L F. Their values have been calculated to be approximately 0.5 to 0.7 times smaller than those of the HWP in USE. Still all stock changes of the HWP in L F were positive and thus accumulating carbon. However when methane outgasing within the HWP in L F had been considered the calculated Greenhouse Gas Balance was zero or negative under the estimated parameters thus to at least partly compensate the positive storage of carbon in HWP in USE. The percentage of CO2 removed by the HWP in USE in comparison to the annual greenhouse gas emissions varied from 0.3 to 1.7 PeRcEnT with a mean value of 0.8 PeRcEnT for the AP6 countries including Canada in contrast to 1.0 PeRcEnT of the EU 25 countries. Despite of the relative small magnitude in relation to the total emission of all GHG this contribution should not be neglected in the GHG Budget of a country. 983:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With the analytical tool: Frankfurt Harvested Wood Products (HWP) Model carbon stocks and carbon stock changes of HWP either in USE or in LANDFILLS have been evaluated from the readily available statistical data base of the FAO FAOSTAT on the wood commodities:   Sawnwood and Wood based Panels   and the paper commodities:   Paper and Paperboard  . Essential differences have been found between the individual 15 EU countries in the comparison of the Stock Change Approach and the Production Approach as well as in the comparison of the stock changes of HWP with the National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) budgets. The stock changes for the HWP in USE within the EU 15 Community have been calculated to be 10.83 Mt C a (39.71 Mt CO2 a) based on the Stock Change Approach and 9.81 Mt C a (35.97 Mt CO2 a) for the Production Approach respectively. These numbers can be compared to the total GHG Inventory of the EU 15 of 4 095 Mt CO2 equivalents including all six Kyoto gases which shows that the carbon sequestration of HWP in USE is of the order of 1 PeRcEnT relative to GHG Inventory. The GHG balance for the carbon stock changes of HWP in LANDFILLS is of similar magnitude as for the HWP in USE and therefore a sink when methane outgasing is disregarded. However when methane outgasing is considered which is formed as a 1:1 mixture with CO2 under the prevailing anaerobic conditions the GHG balance results in minus 10.0 Mt C equivalent a and minus 10.6 Mt C equivalent a for the Stock Change Approach and the Production Approach under the parameters chosen in this study. 1003:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, While evolutionary ecologists emphasize different ways in which plants can evolutionarily respond to herbivory such as resistance or tolerance community ecology has lagged in its understanding of how these different plant traits can influence interactions abundance composition and diversity within more complex food webs. In this paper we present a series of models comparing community level outcomes when plants either resist or tolerate herbivory. We show that resistance and tolerance can lead to very different outcomes. A particularly important result is that resistant species should often coexist locally with other less resistant competitors whereas tolerant species should not be able to coexist locally with less tolerant competitors although priority effects allow them to coexist regionally. We also use these models to suggest some insights into the evolution of these traits within more complex communities. We emphasize how understanding the differential effects of plant tolerance and resistance in food webs provides greater appreciation of a variety of empirical patterns that heretofore have appeared enigmatic. 1015:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  (1) What impact does adaptive movement away from areas of high predation risk have on the dynamics of a prey species and its resource? (2) What can experiments that introduce or remove predator cues tell us about the answer to question (1)? Mathematical methods: These questions are addressed using a two patch meta community model in which predators and or their cues are incorporated into a system consisting of a prey species and its resource. Predators and or cues may be introduced to one or both patches. Key assumptions: Prey species move adaptively to maximize their instantaneous rate of increase but also make some random movement. Predators move randomly or do not move. Resources seldom or never move between patches. Consumer species have saturating functional responses. (1) Adaptive movement can stabilize or destabilize the dynamics of the tri trophic system. (2) Monitoring densities in a single patch may give a misleading indication of the global change in densities. (3) Adaptive prey movement in response to predator cues may increase or decrease prey density. (4) Predator introduction may cause an increase or decrease in the size of the prey population. (5) Short term experiments with local measurements may greatly overestimate the impact of predators on prey and the behavioural component of that impact. (6) The dynamics and interspecific effects in a system with predators and adaptive avoidance by prey cannot in general be deduced from separate experiments with cues alone and with predators in the absence of the cues. (7) Conclusions from recent empirical studies should be reassessed in light of these results. 101:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This study explores the consequences of predator mediated coexistence among competitors for patterns of incidence and diversity at local and regional scales. We develop a model that draws on elements of metapopulation models of competitors and food chains by allowing competitors to coexist locally in the presence of predators but not in their absence. The model predicts that predators promote regional coexistence by greatly expanding the range of conditions under which two competitors persist at equilibrium. Predators could have positive or negative effects on mean local diversity within the region depending on their dispersal rates those of the prey and their effects on prey extinction rates. The presence of predators increased the abundance of inferior competitors thereby expanding the conditions for positive relationships between local and regional diversity. The model also predicted positive correlations between local diversity of predators and prey. These predictions were supported by patterns of phytoplankton zooplankton and fish species richness among lakes. The model may help to resolve the apparent contrast between linear patterns of local and regional richness and experimental evidence for strong invasion resistance and rapid dispersal in zooplankton. 102:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,104:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Two competing consumer species may coexist using a single homogeneous resource when the more efficient consumer the one having the lowest equilibrium resource density has a more non linear functional response that generates consumer resource cycles. We extend this model of nonequilibrium coexistence as proposed by Armstrong and McGehee by putting the interaction into a spatial context using two frameworks: a spatially explicit individual based model and a spatially implicit metapopulation model. We find that Armstrong and McGehees mechanism of coexistence can operate in a spatial context. However individual based simulations suggest that decreased dispersal restricts coexistence in most cases whereas differential equation models of metapopulations suggest that a low rate of dispersal between subpopulations often increases the coexistence region. This difference arises in part because of two potentially opposing effects on coexistence due to the asynchrony in the temporal dynamics at different locations. Asynchrony implies that the less efficient species is more likely to be favored in some spatial locations at any given time which broadens the conditions for coexistence. On the other hand asynchrony and dispersal can also reduce the amplitude of local population cycles which restricts coexistence. The relative influence of these two effects depends on details of the population dynamics and the representation of space. Our results also demonstrate that coexistence via the Armstrong McGehee mechanism can occur even when there is little variation in the global densities of either the consumers or the resource suggesting that empirical studies of the mechanisms should measure densities on several spatial scales. 108:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examine the role of stochasticity and competitive ability in affecting competition between two species using models derived for population genetics. Just as changing population size affects the fixation of a new mutation we show that changing the total number of competitors  community size) can alter the course of competitive exclusion across a wide range of initial starting densities of the two competing species. Shifts in competitive exclusion occur because changes in community size affect the relative importance of competitive ability and stochasticity in affecting the outcome of competition potentially allowing inferior invaders to usurp superior residents. By shifting the role of stochasticity and competitive ability any process that changes the total number of competitors in a habitat ( e. g. disturbance eutrophication fragmentation predation) may lead to shifts in competitive exclusion and the composition of communities. 120:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Foragers can often show a broad range of strategies when searching for resources. The simplest foraging strategy is to search randomly within a habitat; however foragers can often assess habitat quality over various spatial scales and use this information to keep themselves in or direct themselves to regions of high resource abundance or low predation risk. We investigated models that describe a population of consumers competing for a renewable resource that is distributed among discrete patches. Our aim was to identify what foraging strategy or strategies are expected to persist within a population where strategies differ in the degree of habitat assessment  none local or global). We were interested in how the optimal strategies are dependent on the cost of assessment and habitat structure  the variation in renewal rates and predation risks among patches). The models showed that the simple random foraging strategy  make no habitat assessments) often persisted even when the cost of habitat assessment was low. Persistence could occur when habitat assessment and population dynamics generated an ideal free distribution because it could be exploited by the random foragers. Habitat assessment was more advantageous when consumers could not achieve ideal free distributions which was more likely as patches became less productive. When productivity was low we sometimes observed the situation where different foraging strategies generated resource heterogeneities that promoted their coexistence and this could occur even when all patches were intrinsically identical. 1210:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Heterogeneous predation risks can select for predator specific plastic defences in prey populations. However diverse predation threats can generate diffuse selection which in turn can lead to the evolution of more generalized reaction norms. Unreliable predator cues also can select for more generalized plasticity in prey. Here I evaluated the extent to which variation in risk from a focal predator vs. variation in risk from predator diversity and composition were associated with variation in body mass reaction norms in 18 prey populations. Toward this end I assayed the body mass reaction norms in a common garden experiment for spotted salamander larvae Ambystoma maculatum in response to marbled salamander predators Ambystoma opacum local predator richness and the densities of two auxiliary predator species. When raised under controlled conditions prey larvae generally were smaller when exposed to A. opacum kairomones. Among populations the mean and slope of body mass variation was unrelated to A. opacums local density. Predator richness and several key environmental factors were not associated with reaction norm variation. Instead the density of an auxiliary newt predator species was correlated with reduced mass reaction norm slopes. Results suggest that diffuse selection from auxiliary predators can modify the evolution of life history plasticity. 1212:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Much of the debate surrounding the consequences of biodiversity loss centres around the issue of whether different species are functionally similar in their effects on ecological processes. In this study we examined whether populations consisting of smaller more abundant individuals are functionally similar to populations of the same species with larger fewer individuals. We manipulated the biomass and density of banded sunfish (Enneacanthus obesus) and measured their impact on populations of Southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) larvae. We also evaluated the ability of models relating metabolic rate to body size to predict the relative impacts of populations that differ in average body size and population density. Our results indicate that population biomass density and their interaction each play a large role in determining the effect of a predator population on its food resource. Populations with smaller but more abundant individuals had effects as large or larger than those populations with larger but fewer individuals. Although we found qualitative agreement between the observed relative effects of populations with that predicted by allometric models we also found that density dependence can cause effects of a population to differ from that expected based on allometry. The substitutability of populations differing in average body size appears to depend on complex relationships between metabolic rate population density and the strength of density dependence. The restrictive conditions necessary to establish functional equivalence among different populations of the same species suggests that functional equivalence should be rare in most communities. 1219:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Top down control of trophic structure is often highly variable both within and among ecosystems. We explored the roles of relative body sizes of predators and prey their metabolic types the production to biomass ratio (P : B) of plants and system productivity in determining the strength of the indirect effects of predators on plants. We used a well studied food chain model with three trophic levels that is parameterized based on allometric relationships for rates of ingestion and metabolic efficiency. The model predicts that invertebrate and ectotherm predators and herbivores should propagate cascades to a greater degree than vertebrates and endotherms because of their higher metabolic efficiency. Increasing the herbivore to plant body size ratio strengthened the effects of cascades while predator body size was predicted to have no effect. Increasing system productivity or plant P : B magnified cascades. Because herbivore : plant body size ratios and plant P : B are both generally greater in aquatic than terrestrial systems (especially those with unicellular producers) the model predicts stronger cascades in water than on land. This prediction is supported by a recent cross system comparison of trophic cascade experiments. We discuss features of natural systems that are not incorporated into the model and their implications for the intensity of trophic cascades across ecosystems. 130:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We analyze a game theory model in which individuals foraging on a habitat continuum choose behaviors that are the   best responses   to the behaviors and densities of competitors. These behaviors determine community invasibility and coexistence. By making fitness an explicit function of maintenance metabolic cost we can show that changes in maintenance cost have an indirect but important effect on the best response behaviors and hence on community dynamics. In particular decreasing maintenance cost has the effect of decreasing habitat resource levels by increasing the efficiency with which individuals convert resources into offspring. The resulting decrease in habitat resource levels increases each phenotypes relative foraging advantage in whatever habitat(s) it holds an absolute advantage. As a result more phenotypes can successfully invade the community. Indeed low enough maintenance costs results in species inhabiting evolutionary minima in the adaptive landscape which promotes disruptive selection and provides the potential for an evolutionary bifurcation. 1337:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A mean field metapopulation model of a predator prey interaction is developed in order to understand the consequences of habitat destruction at different trophic levels. Such a model allows us to explore different ecological scenarios (donor control vs. top down control) by changing a single parameter. The response to habitat destruction is qualitatively the same for both predator and prey although there are interesting differences linked to the trophic position. A similar decrease in the colonization rate affects the two species quite differently. Predators diminish faster than prey and furthermore the fraction of occupied sites decreases more sharply as colonization rates are lowered there is a nonlinear relationship between regional abundance and colonization rate. There is a well defined threshold in the colonization rate below which the predator becomes extinct. Thus dispersal rate is critical for predicting the consequences of habitat destruction. Finally these results are compared with the behavior of a spatially explicit simulation. The only difference between the analytical model and the simulation is that colonization is no longer a global phenomenon in the latter but it is a local process constrained to the nearest patches. The bulk of the results are similar to the mean field behavior and we comment on some differences related with non homogeneity and real space. Some general implications for conservation biology and biological control are outlined. 1342:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Models are examined in which two prey species compete for two nutrient resources and are preyed upon by a predator that recycles both nutrients. Two factors determine the effective relative supply of the nutrients hence competitive outcomes: the external nutrient supply ratio and the relative recycling of the two nutrients within the system. This second factor is governed by predator stoichiometry its relative requirements for nutrients in its own biomass. A model with nutrient resources that are essential for the competing prey is detailed. Criteria are given to identify the limiting nutrient for a food chain of one competitor with the predator. Increased supply of this limiting nutrient increases predator density and concentration of this nutrient at equilibrium while decreasing the concentration of a non limiting nutrient. Changes in supply or recycling of a non limiting nutrient affect only the concentration of that nutrient. Criteria for the invasion of a second prey competitor are presented. When different nutrients limit growth of the resident prey and the invader increased supply or recycling of the invaders limiting nutrient assists invasion while increased supply or recycling of the residents limiting nutrient hinders invasion. If the same nutrient limits both resident and invader then changes in supply and recycling have complex effects on invasion depending on species properties. In a parameterized model of a planktonic ecosystem green algae and cyanobacteria coexist over a wide range of nitrogen: phosphorus supply ratios without predators. When the herbivore Daphnia is added coexistence is eliminated or greatly restricted and green algae dominate over a wide range of supply conditions because the effective supply of P is greatly reduced as Daphnia rapidly recycles N. 1370:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Anthropogenic alterations of nutrient inputs and food web structure are two of the primary stressors affecting lake phytoplankton. This paper explores the independent and interactive effects of nutrients and food web structure (as indexed by zooplankton size) on phytoplankton size structure by fitting time series models to data from three lakes where both factors have been manipulated. I assessed phytoplankton size structure using three different approaches: small and large size classes normalized size spectra and average phytoplankton size. Increased phosphorus loading and increased zooplankton size had positive effects on large phytoplankton slope of size spectra and mean phytoplankton size but negative effects on the relative abundance of small phytoplankton. The absolute abundance of small phytoplankton was increased by increased nutrients and decreased by increased zooplankton size. There was some evidence for nutrient x zooplankton interactions particularly from interlake comparisons which revealed that phytoplankton size structure responded to enrichment in qualitatively similar but quantitatively different ways in lakes with different food webs. Specifically small phytoplankton increased more strongly with enrichment in lakes with many planktivores and few large zooplankton while large phytoplankton increased more in lakes with few planktivores and many large zooplankton. Thus food web structure may influence the extent to which small vs large phytoplankton respond to nutrient enrichment. Overall size structure was an excellent descriptor of shifts in phytoplankton communities following manipulation of nutrient inputs and food web structure. Size spectra and size classes were highly effective approaches for summarizing size structure; average phytoplankton size was somewhat less effective. 1390:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biodiversity at multiple levels genotypes within species species within functional groups habitats within a landscape enhances productivity resource use and stability of seagrass ecosystems. Several themes emerge from a review of the mostly indirect evidence and the few experiments that explicitly manipulated diversity in seagrass systems. First because many seagrass communities are dominated by 1 or a few plant species genetic and phenotypic diversity within such foundation species has important influences on ecosystem productivity and stability. Second in seagrass beds and many other aquatic systems consumer control is strong extinction is biased toward large body size and high trophic levels and thus human impacts are often mediated by interactions of changing vertical diversity (food chain length) with changing horizontal diversity (heterogeneity within trophic levels). Third the openness of marine systems means that ecosystem structure and processes often depend on interactions among habitats within a landscape (landscape diversity). There is clear evidence from seagrass systems that advection of resources and active movement of consumers among adjacent habitats influence nutrient fluxes trophic transfer fishery production and species diversity. Future investigations of biodiversity effects on processes within seagrass and other aquatic ecosystems would benefit from broadening the concept of biodiversity to encompass the hierarchy of genetic through landscape diversity focusing on links between diversity and trophic interactions and on links between regional diversity local diversity and ecosystem processes. Maintaining biodiversity and biocomplexity of seagrass and other coastal ecosystems has important conservation and management implications. 1394:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Previous studies suggest that food web theory has yet to account for major differences in food web properties of marine versus other types of ecosystems. We examined this issue by analyzing the network structure of food webs for the Northeast US Shelf a Caribbean reef and Benguela off South Africa. The values of connectance (links per species(2)) link density (links per species) mean chain length and fractions of intermediate omnivorous and cannibalistic taxa of these marine webs are somewhat high but still within the ranges observed in other webs. We further compared the marine webs by using the empirically corroborated niche model that accounts for observed variation in diversity (taxon number) and complexity (connectance). Our results substantiate previously reported results for estuarine fresh water and terrestrial datasets which suggests that food webs from different types of ecosystems with variable diversity and complexity share fundamental structural and ordering characteristics. Analyses of potential secondary extinctions resulting from species loss show that the structural robustness of marine food webs is also consistent with trends from other food webs. As expected given their relatively high connectance marine food webs appear fairly robust to loss of most connected taxa as well as random taxa. Still the short average path length between marine taxa (1.6 links) suggests that effects from perturbations such as over fishing can be transmitted more widely throughout marine ecosystems than previously appreciated. 1398:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The functioning of the global ecosystem is mediated in large part by pelagic marine organisms through their influence on biomass production elemental cycling and atmospheric composition. Growing theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the stability and functioning of this complex system may depend not only on aggregate biomass and production of pelagic producers and consumers but also on the composition and richness of taxa within those compartments Yet rigorous experimental tests of relationships between diversity and these aspects of pelagic ecosystem functioning are virtually unknown Here we argue for more attention to such research and we marshal preliminary evidence that several mechanisms underlying diversity effects on ecosystem processes in marine benthic and terrestrial systems also may operate in pelagic systems. We review selected examples of how genetic species and functional group diversity may affect ocean ecosystem processes. We consider 3 types of examples that detail how (1) producer richness or composition can directly affect ecosystem processes (2) consumer diversity can directly and indirectly affect these same processes and (3) diversity at and below the species level can reduce variation of communities through time and enhance their resistance to perturbations. We suggest several promising avenues for assessing the role of biodiversity in pelagic ecosystems. Understanding and predicting responses of the global ocean ecosystem to accelerating climate and environmental change will be enhanced by more explicit and systematic attention to the functional diversity of microbial and macroscopic marine life. 142:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence which may be stable or unstable Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency dependent predation as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence in which species diversity slowly decays over time have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover. 145:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1473:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most species live in species rich food webs; yet for a century most mathematical models for population dynamics have included only one or two species(1 3). We ask whether such models are relevant to the real world. Two species population models of an interacting consumer and resource collapse to one species dynamics when recruitment to the resource population is unrelated to resource abundance thereby weakening the coupling between consumer and resource(4 6). We predict that in nature generalist consumers that feed on many species should similarly show one species dynamics. We test this prediction using cyclic populations in which it is easier to infer underlying mechanisms(7) and which are widespread in nature(8). Here we show that one species cycles can be distinguished from consumer resource cycles by their periods. We then analyse a large number of time series from cyclic populations in nature and show that almost all cycling generalist consumers examined have periods that are consistent with one species dynamics. Thus generalist consumers indeed behave as if they were one species populations and a one species model is a valid representation for generalist population dynamics in many species food webs. 1477:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predation can be intense creating strong direct and indirect effects throughout food webs(1 4). In addition ecologists increasingly recognize that fluxes of organisms across ecosystem boundaries can have major consequences for community dynamics(5 6). Species with complex life histories often shift habitats during their life cycles(7) and provide potent conduits coupling ecosystems(5 6). Thus local interactions that affect predator abundance in one ecosystem ( for example a larval habitat) may have reverberating effects in another ( for example an adult habitat). Here we show that fish indirectly facilitate terrestrial plant reproduction through cascading trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries. Fish reduce larval dragonfly abundances in ponds leading to fewer adult dragonflies nearby. Adult dragonflies consume insect pollinators and alter their foraging behaviour. As a result plants near ponds with fish receive more pollinator visits and are less pollen limited than plants near fish free ponds. Our results confirm that strong species interactions can reverberate across ecosystems and emphasize the importance of landscape level processes in driving local species interactions. 1502:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Above lowshore levels of wave beaten rocky shores desiccation from tidal exposure and hydrodynamics stresses from wave action are thought to create refuges from predation allowing concentrations of sedentary prey such as mussel beds. Underwater time lapse photography on rocky shores in Southern California revealed that dense aggregations of spiny lobsters prey on mussels during nocturnal high tides. In contradiction of the refuge hypothesis the densest aggregations occurred on midshore levels of the most wave exposed site a semi protected site showed intermediate densities and a protected site showed only sparse numbers of lobsters. On wave beaten shores the lobsters high mobility and rapid prey handling allowed them to exploit intertidal prey in the brief period at extreme high tide when both desiccation and hydrodynamic stresses were at a minimum. The spatial differences in lobster densities were however positively related to the recruitment rates of juvenile mussels the preferred prey. A field experiment demonstrated that predation by lobsters within a mussel bed affects the age size structure of the bed without changing primary percent coverage. Therefore concentrations of adult prey on some wave swept sites appear to result from elevated rates of prey recruitment that surpass rates of predation rather than absolute refuges from predation. 1505:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Defensive modifications in prey traits that reduce predation risk can also have negative effects on prey fitness. Such nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of predators are common often quite strong and can even dominate the net effect of predators. We develop an intuitive graphical model to identify and explore the conditions promoting strong NCEs. The model illustrates two conditions necessary and sufficient for large NCEs: (1) trait change has a large cost and (2) the benefit of reduced predation outweighs the costs such as reduced growth rate. A corollary condition is that potential predation in the absence of trait change must be large. In fact the sum total of the consumptive effects (CEs) and NCEs may be any value bounded by the magnitude of the predation rate in the absence of the trait change. The model further illustrates how depending on the effect of increased trait change on resulting costs and benefits any combination of strong and weak NCEs and CEs is possible. The model can also be used to examine how changes in environmental factors  refuge safety) or variation among predator prey systems  different benefits of a prey trait change) affect NCEs. Results indicate that simple rules of thumb may not apply; factors that increase the cost of trait change or that increase the degree to which an animal changes a trait can actually cause smaller (rather than larger) NCEs. We provide examples of how this graphical model can provide important insights for empirical studies from two natural systems. Implementation of this approach will improve our understanding of how and when NCEs are expected to dominate the total effect of predators. Further application of the models will likely promote a better linkage between experimental and theoretical studies of NCEs and foster synthesis across systems. 1511:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Parasites that are transmitted through predator prey interactions may be used as indicators of trophic relationships between organisms. Yet they are rarely used as such in the construction of topological (predator prey) food webs. We constructed food webs of vertebrate trophic interactions using observed diet alone trophically transmitted parasites alone and the combination of the two based on data from 31 species of fish from the Bothnian Bay Finland. The fish food web contained 530 links derived from observed diet 724 links inferred from parasitism and 1 058 links calculated from a combination of both stomach contents and parasites. This sub web constructed from stomach contents had a mean of 17.1 links per fish species while that using parasites had 23.4 links per fish. Combining the two diet indicators yielded 34.1 links per fish species illustrating the complementarity of the two methods. Mean number of prey species per fish species was 12.5 using observed diet items 15.8 using parasites and 24.5 using both measures together. Mean number of predators per fish species was 7.4 using observed diet 11.7 using parasites and 15.0 using both. A positive correlation was found between the mean number of parasites and the number of prey taxa in the diet among the fishes. Omnivorous fish had the highest diversity of both parasite species and prey items while benthophagous fish had among the lowest. Mean total abundance and mean total prevalence of parasites correlated positively with fish size with piscivores being the largest with the highest abundance and prevalence while planktivores and benthivores had the lowest. Trophically transmitted parasites may be used to help construct vertebrate sub webs and derive information about food web processes. Parasites alone provided equivalent if not more information than observed diet. However resolution is improved by using parasites and observed diet together. 1516:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Theoretical efforts suggest that the relative sizes of predators and their prey can shape community dynamics the structure of food webs and the evolution of life histories. However much of this work has assumed static predator and prey body sizes. The timing of recruitment and the growth patterns of both predator and prey have the potential to modify the strength of predator prey interactions. In this study I examined how predator size dynamics in 40 temporary ponds over a 3 year period affected the survival of spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) larvae. Across communities gape limited predator richness but not size was correlated with habitat duration (pond permanence). Within communities mean gape limited predator size diminished as the growing season progressed. This size reduction occurred because prey individuals grew into a body size refuge and because the largest of the predators left ponds by mid season. Elevated gape limited predation risk across time and space was predicted by the occurrence of two large predatory salamanders: marbled salamander larvae (Ambystoma opacum) and red spotted newt adults (Notophthalmus viridescens). The presence of the largest gape limited predator A. opacum predicted A. maculatum larval survival in the field. The distribution of large predatory salamanders among ponds and across time is expected to lead to differing community dynamics and to generate divergent natural selection on early growth and body size in A. maculatum. In general a dynamic perspective on predator size often will be necessary to understand the ecology and evolution of species interactions. This will be especially true in frequently disturbed or seasonal habitats where phenology and ontogeny interact to determine body size asymmetries. 1518:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The topological analysis of food webs is a recently reinvigorated and rapidly growing area of inquiry in community ecology. Topological studies assess system properties using the number and distribution of connections among nodes in an interconnected network. Analysis of a food web as a network of links (feeding relationships) and nodes (species) is not a new approach; however recent advances by physicists in the study of complex networks have revived this area of theoretical community ecology. Here we discuss a few characteristics of food webs that may cause them to respond differently to node loss than other types of networks. We also suggest ways in which empiricists can provide data to test predictions derived from complex network theory. Complex network analysis has shown that the sensitivity of a network to node loss depends on the frequency distribution of connections among nodes. Current theoretical developments suggest that networks can be classified into two broad categories based on the frequency distribution of links: exponential or scale free. Each node in an exponential network has a similar number of links to other nodes. The frequency distribution of the number of links per node in this type of network has an exponential decay. Because nodes in an exponential network have similar numbers of links the loss of any given node from this type of network causes a monotonic increase in the number of links required to connect any two nodes in the network. In contrast a scale free network has a few nodes with a large number of links and many nodes with only a few links. Although connectivity in scale free networks does not decrease with the random loss of nodes as in an exponential network scale free networks are extremely sensitive to the loss of highly connected hub nodes. In recent work researchers have used frequency distribution models to describe the properties of a broad array of complex networks such as social networks the World Wide Web transportation networks and enzymatic pathways. The obvious extension of this theory to food web dynamics has renewed interest in the topology of trophic webs. Williams and Martinez show that a simple topological model can reproduce properties of complex food webs. But when we examine empirical webs does the frequency distribution of trophic connections show a general pattern? If so is the structure of food webs generally exponential or scale free? A recent assessment of several food webs suggests that they share the scale free properties of many other complex networks implying that their structure should be resistant to random attacks but quite sensitive to loss of hub species. The general applicability of recent findings in complex network theory to food web studies depends on whether topological descriptions capture key aspects of communities and ecosystems such as the flow of energy or factors regulating populations. An increase in biological realism may be merged with suitable data in future food web analyses to better understand processes structuring communities. Further work in this area will allow us to determine the appropriate role of complex network theory in the modeling and conservation of ecological communities. In addition future advances in community ecology that develop from network theory depend on successful communication between theoreticians and empiricists. In particular although theoreticians must determine whether the observed structure of food webs supports existing theory empiricists must recognize and provide information appropriate for parameterizing and testing theoretical models. Complex network theory may provide an avenue for collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists that could lead to rapid advances in our understanding of ecological communities.  1522:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, According to our analysis link density in food webs decreases with trophic position so that it is greatly reduced toward the top of the trophic hierarchy. This outcome that seems to challenge previous conclusions based on null models strongly depends on link quantification. Including interaction strengths may improve substantially our understanding of food web organization and possibly contradict results based on the analysis of binary webs. 1532:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conventional theories of population and community dynamics are based on a single currency such as number of individuals biomass carbon or energy. However organisms are constructed of multiple elements and often require them (in particular carbon phosphorus and nitrogen) in different ratios than provided by their resources; this mismatch may constrain the net transfer of energy and elements through trophic levels. Ecological stoichiometry the study of the balance of elements in ecological processes offers a framework for exploring ecological effects of such constraints. We review recent theoretical and empirical studies that have considered how stoichiometry may affect population and community dynamics. These studies show that stoichiometric constraints can affect several properties of populations (e. g. stability oscillations consumer extinction) and communities (e. g. coexistence of competitors competitive interactions between different guilds). We highlight gaps in general knowledge and focus on areas of population and community ecology where incorporation of stoichiometric constraints may be particularly fruitful such as studies of demographic bottlenecks spatial processes and multi species interactions. Finally we suggest promising directions for new research by recommending potential study systems (terrestrial insects detritivory based webs soil communities) to improve our understanding of populations and communities. Our conclusion is that a better integration of stoichiometric principles and other theoretical approaches in ecology may allow for a richer understanding of both population and community structure and dynamics. 1535:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological stoichiometry has emerged as a tool for exploring nutrient demand and evolutionary responses to nutrient limitation. Previous studies of insects have found predictable variability in stoichiometry both in relation to body size and trophic mode at ordinal levels or higher. Our study further examines the evolutionary and ecological lability in these traits by comparing the effects of body size trophic mode (larval and adult) and larval habitat on the stoichiometry of insects within one order (Diptera). The study also expands on previous work by analyzing trophic mode both at coarse (detritivore herbivore predator) and fine (high vs low nutrient quality resources within trophic categories) scales and by comparing nutrient stoichiometry in two geographical regions Sweden and Arizona. As predicted adults feeding on nectar or pollen had the lowest body N content in the dataset. Additionally for Diptera with predatory larvae species low N diets had lower body N content than those with high N diets. However body N content was not consistently lower for all species with low N resources as species feeding on plant material were indistinguishable in stoichiometry from predators with high N diets. We suggest that these results emerge because larval resource exploitation is poorly understood in herbivorous Diptera species. Body P content for Swedish Diptera decreased with body size for all trophic modes and the only difference among trophic modes was that blood feeders had higher P content than other groups. The regional comparison further showed that the allometry of body P content is a labile trait that may vary at regional scales as there was no allometric scaling of body P content in the Arizona data set in contrast to the Swedish data set. These results are not easily explained by existing theoretical frameworks but instead point to a general context dependence of P stoichiometry which should now be a focus for future work. 1536:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Experiments and theory in single trophic level systems dominate biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research and recent debates. All natural ecosystems contain communities with multiple trophic levels however and this can have important effects on ecosystem structure and functioning. Furthermore many experiments compare assembled communities rather than examining loss of species directly. We identify three questions around which to organise an investigation of how species loss affects the structure and functioning of multitrophic systems. 1) What is the distribution of species richness among trophic levels; 2) from which trophic levels are species most often lost; and 3) does loss of species from different trophic levels influence ecosystem functioning differently? Our analyses show that: 1) Relatively few high quality data are available concerning the distribution of species richness among trophic levels. A new data set provides evidence of a decrease in species richness as trophic height increases. 2) Multiple lines of evidence indicate that species are lost from higher trophic levels more frequently than lower trophic levels. 3) A theoretical model suggests that both the structure of food webs (occurrence of omnivory and the distribution of species richness among trophic levels) and the trophic level from which species are lost determines the impact of species loss on ecosystem functioning which can even vary in the sign of the effect. These results indicate that at least for aquatic systems models of single trophic level ecosystems are insufficient for understanding the functional consequences of extinctions. Knowledge is required of food web structure which species are likely to be lost and also whether cascading extinctions will occur. 1540:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, General predictions of community dynamics require that insights derived from local habitats can be scaled up to explain phenomena across geographic scales. Across these larger spatial extents adaptation can play an increasing role in determining the outcome of species interactions. If local adaptation is common then our ability to generalize measures of species interaction strength across communities will be limited without an additional understanding of the genetic variation underlying interaction traits. In the context of predator prey interactions prey individuals commonly are expected to reduce risky foraging behaviors and subsequent growth under predation threat. However rapid growth into a large body size can defend against gape limited predators creating a tradeoff between increased predation risk due to elevated foraging activity and decreased predation risk due to large size. Here I combine field observations natural selection experiments and common garden assays to understand potential adaptations of spotted salamander Ambystoma maculatum larvae to gape limited and gape unconstrained predators. Field observations and natural selection trials suggested antagonistic selection on prey body size among ponds dominated by gape limited predator salamanders A. opacum and gape unconstrained beetle larvae Dytiscus. In common garden experiments prey from sites with high gape limited predation risk grew larger than those from other sites suggesting the evolution of rapid growth into a Prey size refuge. Larvae from all sites grew to a large size when exposed to the gape limited N. viridescens predators kairomones. Hence induced rapid growth into a size refuge may be an adaptive response to gape limited predation risk. Results point to an important role for cross community generalizations based on functional classifications of predators by their gape constraints and inter site genetic variation in prey growth rates and behaviors. 1541:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Habitat temperature is often assumed to serve as an effective proxy for organism body temperature when making predictions of species distributions under future climate change. However the determinants of body temperature are complex and organisms in identical microhabitats can occupy radically different thermal niches. This can have major implications of our understanding of how thermal stress modulates predator prey relationships under field conditions. Using body temperature data from four different sites on Santa Cruz Island California we show that at two sites the body temperatures of a keystone predator (the seastar Pisaster ochraceus) and its prey (the mussel Mytilus californianus) followed very different trajectories even though both animals occupied identical microhabitats. At the other two sites body temperatures of predator and prey were closely coupled across a range of scales. The dynamical differences between predator and prey body temperatures depended on the location of pairs of sites at the extremes of a persistent landscape scale weather pattern observed across the island. Thus the well understood predator prey interaction between Pisaster and Mytilus cannot be predicted based on habitat level information alone as is now commonly attempted with landscape level (climate envelope) models. 1548:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most studies on ecological networks consider only a single interaction type  competitive predatory or mutualistic) and try to developrules for system stability based exclusively on properties of this interaction type. However the stability of ecological networks may be more dependent on the way different interaction types are combined in real communities. To address this issue we start by compiling an ecological network in the Donana Biological Reserve southern Spain with 390 species and 798 mu tualistic and antagonistic interactions. We characterize network structure by looking at how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are combined across all plant species. Both the ratio of mutualistic to antagonistic interactions per plant and the number of basic modules with an antagonistic and a mutualistic interaction are very heterogeneous across plant species with a few plant species showing very high values for these parameters. To assess the implications of these network patterns on species diversity we study analytically and by simulation a model of this ecological network. We find that the observed correlation between strong interaction strengths and high mutualistic to antagonistic ratios in a few plant species significantly increases community diversity. Thus to predict the persistence of biodiversity we need to understand how interaction strength and the architecture of ecological networks with different interaction types are combined. 1552:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent meta analyses confirm that the strength of trophic cascades (indirect positive effects of predators on plant biomass through control of herbivores) varies among ecosystem types. In particular most terrestrial systems show smaller cascades than most aquatic ones. Ecologists still remain challenged to explain this variation. Here we examine a food quality hypothesis which states that higher quality plants should promote stronger trophic cascades. Food quality involves two components: digestion resistance of plants and magnitude of stoichiometric imbalance between plants and herbivores (where stoichiometry involves ratios of nutrient: carbon ratio of tissues). Both factors vary among ecosystems and could mediate conversion efficiency of plants into new herbivores (and hence control of plants by herbivores). We explored the food quality hypothesis using two models one assuming that plant stoichiometry is a fixed trait the other one allowing this trait to vary dynamically (but with a minimal nutrient: carbon ratio of structural mass). Both models produce the same suite of results. First as expected systems with more easily digested plants promote stronger cascades. Second contrary to expectations higher (fixed or minimal) nutrient: carbon ratio of plants do not promote stronger cascades largely because of the net result of ecosystem feedbacks. Still the model with dynamic stoichiometry permits positive correlations of realized plant nutrient: carbon ratio and cascade strength (as predicted) mediated through digestion resistance. Third lower nutrient: carbon ratio of herbivores promotes stronger cascades. However this result likely cannot explain variation in cascade strength because nutrient: carbon stoichiometry of herbivores does not vary greatly between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Finally we found that predation promotes nutrient limitation of herbivores. This finding highlights that food web processes such as predation can influence stoichiometry mediated interactions of plants and herbivores. 1555:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species distributional limits may coincide with hard dispersal barriers or physiological thresholds along environmental gradients but they may also be influenced by species interactions. We explore a number of models of interspecific interactions that lead to (sometimes abrupt) distribution limits in the presence and absence of environmental gradients. We find that gradients in competitive ability can lead to spatial segregation of competitors into distinct ranges but that spatial movement tends to broaden the region of sympatry between the two species and that Allee effects tend to sharpen these boundaries. We generalize these simple models to include metapopulation dynamics and other types of interactions including predator prey and host parasite interactions. We derive conditions for range limits in each case. We also consider models that include coevolution and gene flow and find that character displacement along environmental gradients can lead to stable parapatric distributions. We conclude that it is essential to consider coevolved species interactions as a potential mechanism limiting species distributions particularly when barriers to dispersal are weak and environmental gradients are gradual. 1562:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding how diversity interacts with energy supply is of broad ecological interest. Most studies to date have investigated patterns within trophic levels reflecting a lack of food webs which include information on energy flow. We added parasites to a published marine energy flow food web to explore whether parasite diversity is correlated with energy flow to host taxa. Parasite diversity was high with 36 parasite taxa affecting 40 of the 51 animal taxa. Adding parasites increased the number of trophic links per species trophic link strength connectance and food chain lengths. There was evidence of an asymptotic relationship between energy flowing through a food chain and parasite diversity although there were clear outliers. High parasite diversity was associated with host taxa which were highly connected within the food web. This suggests that energy flow through a taxon may favour parasite diversity up to a maximal value. The evolutionary and energetic basis for that limitation is of key interest in understanding the basis for parasite diversity in natural food webs and thus their role in food web dynamics. 1563:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the factors that constrain and drive changes in food chain length represents an open challenge in ecology. Although several explanatory hypotheses have been proposed no synthesis has yet been achieved. The role of body size has been well studied in recent years because the hierarchy of trophic connections in which large animals consume small ones suggests a positive relationship between trophic position and body size. Empirical evidence however supports the existence of both positive and negative associations and some studies have even reported no significant relationship between trophic position and body size. These results suggest that the relationship may be non monotonic and driven by several interacting mechanisms. Here we analyze the effects of energetic limitations and structural constraints on species trophic positions. We show that the trophic position of small bodied animals can be limited by their ability to consume large prey whereas energetic limitations strongly constrain trophic positions for large bodied animals with the intensity of this constraint depending on the amount of energy available to top predators. These differences in limiting mechanisms can account for the observed variability in the association between the trophic position of top predators and size. Furthermore our derivation makes use of the Metabolic theory of ecology and predicts a negative relationship between temperature and the maximum achievable food chain length providing a mechanistic foundation for the observed reductions in food chain length with temperature. 1566:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a framework for explaining variation in predator invasion success and predator impacts on native prey that integrates information about predator prey naivete predator and prey behavioral responses to each other consumptive and non consumptive effects of predators on prey and interacting effects of multiple species interactions. We begin with the naive prey hypothesis that posits that naive native prey that lack evolutionary history with non native predators suffer heavy predation because they exhibit ineffective antipredator responses to novel predators. Not all naive prey however show ineffective antipredator responses to novel predators. To explain variation in prey response to novel predators we focus on the interaction between prey use of general versus specific cues and responses and the functional similarity of non native and native predators. Effective antipredator responses reduce predation rates (reduce consumptive effects of predators CEs) but often also carry costs that result in non consumptive effects (NCEs) of predators. We contrast expected CEs versus NCEs for non native versus native predators and discuss how differences in the relative magnitudes of CEs and NCEs might influence invasion dynamics. Going beyond the effects of naive prey we discuss how the naive prey enemy release and evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypotheses are inter related and how the importance of all three might be mediated by prey and predator naivete. These ideas hinge on the notion that non native predators enjoy a novelty advantage associated with the naivete of native prey and top predators. However non native predators could instead suffer from a novelty disadvantage because they are also naive to their new prey and potential predators. We hypothesize that patterns of community similarity and evolution might explain the variation in novelty advantage that can underlie variation in invasion outcomes. Finally we discuss management implications of our framework including suggestions for managing invasive predators predator reintroductions and biological control. 157:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Auklets (Alcidae) can be very abundant in north temperate to arctic seas. Their numbers and trophic impacts in a given area depend on their ability to forage profitably as a function of the dispersion depth and density of prey patches. Thus modeling these relationships is important when predicting the auklets response to environmental change. This paper presents a simulation model of the foraging costs and intake rates of Cassins auklets Ptychoramphus aleuticus (similar to 170 g) and least auklets Aethia pusilla (similar to 80 g) once they have located a patch of zooplankton prey. In the model water temperature and dive depth (max. 20 m) have important effects on dive costs mainly by affecting the duration and magnitude of costs during passive ascent. Within a prey patch modeled intake rates are limited at relatively low prey densities by pursuit and handling time after a prey item is detected. Because intake rate is limited by capture time and not prey visibility the model indicates that changes in light conditions over these depths have little direct effect on intake rates of zooplankton prey. However vertical migration of prey in response to diel light cycles can strongly affect profitability (energy gain minus cost) by altering the depth of dives to prey patches. Because pursuit and handling time limit modeled intake rate profitability cannot be increased further by finding patches of higher density but rather by extending time in patches by swimming farther or slower. The model suggests that auklet dispersion should be insensitive to variations in patch density above a threshold that is relatively low compared to the very high densities that can occur. However auklets may be attracted to higher density patches because the patches themselves are more visible or predictable or because other predators from seabirds to whales may gather in such patches and increase their visibility. 1642:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Darwin chose the metaphor of a tangled bank to conclude the Origin of species . Two centuries after Darwins birth we are still untangling the complex ecological networks he has pondered. In particular studies of food webs provide important insights into how natural ecosystems function. Although the nonlinear interactions between many species creates challenges of scale resolution of data and significant computational constraints the last 10 years have seen significant advances built on the earlier classic studies of Cohen May Pimm Polis Lawton and Yodzis. These gains stem from advances in computing power and the collation of more comprehensive data from a broader array of empirical food webs. Increasingly environmental disruption unravels the tangled bank. The authors of the papers collected in this synthesis were specifically requested to examine how studies and models of food webs can inform the management of natural ecosystems. A common question is what makes food webs collapse? Several authors in this synthesis also describe what food web studies have told us about the restoration of natural ecosystems and how species composition and interactions affect the provisioning of ecosystem services. If our understanding of food webs is to have a firm empirical basis we need to describe and attempt to model the structure of webs for a variety of natural and human modified ecosystems. At present a significant proportion of ecosystem management is based upon a blend of conventional wisdom insights from single species studies pressure to conserve charismatic vertebrates attempts to balance the integrity of the natural ecosystem with the benefits it is expected to provide to the local community (community conservation) and occasional adaptive management. While we do not suggest that food web theory should replace any of these approaches we do make a plea for it to be more widely considered in plans for the management of national parks and the biodiversity they seek to preserve. A considerable urgency drives attempts to assemble data for webs from large undisturbed and pristine ecosystems such as tropical grasslands forests and coral reefs. Moreover if the principal arguments for conserving natural ecosystems are based purely on economic benefits then we need to develop a theory that links ecosystem services to food web structure. To conclude we identify some priorities for foodweb research that apply to the conservation of biological diversity. (i) It is time to move ecosystem based management from a catch phrase to a sound science. Network theory is a logical first step towards a theory of ecosystem based management. Studies from food webs should provide insights into how to conserve assemblages of species needed to maintain the emergent ecosystem level properties of a system and in particular continue to provide the economic goods and services. Once we can map ecosystem services onto trophic levels food web theory can help explain how species extinctions or declines in abundance lead to reductions in the rate of delivery of economic services. (ii) A key area where food webs may inform ecosystem based management is in the ocean. The repeated failures of single species fisheries to sustain profitable harvest have led to an increased popularity of marine protected areas. In such areas fished species increase in abundance. But indirect effects are often common depending on the ecological role of fished species. This synthesis suggests using ecological networks to identify and predict the multiple indirect effects that result from fishing. (iii) Robustness is a key measure of secondary extinctions in food web models. It is one of the most obvious metrics that food web theory can provide to conservation biology. Topological studies of robustness can identify bottom up paths to secondary extinction such as how loss of basal and intermediate species leads to the secondary extinction of species dependent upon these for food and other resources (nest sites pollination parasites). Such studies describe how the architecture of the web determines its resilience to perturbations mediated by bottom up processes. While this is a powerful tool there is a need to develop mathematical mechanisms to examine how top down effects modify web structure as there is considerable empirical evidence for the importance of these top down effects in natural systems. In particular the detailed empirical studies of John Terborgh and his colleagues on the recently created islands in Lago Guri in Venezuela sharply illustrate the dominant effect that top down effects have on food web structure through their impact on the relative abundance of species on lower trophic levels. (iv) Static webs are typically the cumulative result of interactions in an arbitrary spatial and temporal scale. The last 3 years have seen an increasing emphasis on non equilibrium dynamics. The topology of food webs in nature can change dramatically in time and space as the result of fluctuations in the abundance of a keystone species and due to seasonal variation. A landscape theory of food webs would help to emphasize the role of mobility and adaptive behaviour in food web stability. Here the challenge is to balance biological realism and tractability when considering the merits of static and dynamic approaches. (v) Concerning dynamic approaches we can ask how far we can move beyond multi species Lotka Volterra systems and linear extrapolations of these. Modelling food webs using dynamical systems requires many species specific parameters such as the birth and death rate of each species and the functional responses that describe consumer resource interactions. The complete parametrization of real systems remains intractable. Allometric relations provide one way to reduce the dimensionality of parameter space in food web models. Other ways of modelling food webs have recently emerged including agentbased models and simple stochastic models (similar to the birth death processes popular for studying the neutral theory of biodiversity). Owing to the uncertainty in parameter values and functional forms efforts to relate structure to dynamics should focus on pattern oriented modelling to seek robust qualitative patterns. (vi) Parasites are increasingly recognized as common constituents of ecological networks. Are their roles different from those of free living species? How do they affect the robustness of webs or the probability of secondary extinctions? Parasites tend to use a lower diversity of resources than free living consumers. In addition many have complex life cycles making them dependent on species diversity. These factors make parasites particularly prone to bottom up secondary extinctions. The extent to which parasites can contribute to top down extinctions is difficult to determine from topological webs but may be relatively unlikely given results from various population models. On one hand parasites reduce robustness in a network due to their sensitivity to secondary extinction on the other hand they may play a critical role in regulating abundance. However few ecological networks include parasites thus we are unable as yet to generalize about their impacts. Given that parasitism is the most ubiquitous consumer strategy most food webs are probably grossly inadequate representations of natural communities. (vii) As mentioned in the introduction by May there is increasing interest in the insights that the structural properties of food webs can provide into other complex adaptive systems that have a network structure for example biochemical pathways in physiological systems and economic systems. The coupled and often nested pairs of fast and slow chains of dynamic interactions that seem increasingly important in stabilizing food web networks have important parallels with the way national economies are organized and divided into rapidly traded short stocks whose daily turnover is reported on the nightly news and the long term savings and loans of mortgages and pensions. If money markets do share similarities in their dynamic properties with food webs then we should not be entirely surprised that financial markets become unstable when the long term savings and loans are gambled by traders as short term hedge funds. On a more optimistic note the last decades have seen increased emphasis on the importance of recycling of used goods and their packaging. This uncannily echoes the evolution of the detritivores guilds that undertake crucial roles in the webs described by Olff . In a complementary fashion a commodity such as oil drives the dynamics of many individual economic pathways. Oil acts as rainfall or sunlight in ecological systems. When oil is abundant the system works quickly and efficiently; furthermore it creates additional economic inputs through jobs in exploitation and distribution. In contrast when oil is scarce competition increases among all parts of the economic food web ; this significantly reduces the elasticity of the system and produces levels of economic and social disruption which often harshly illustrate how distant nodes of the web are intimately coupled. Ultimately food webs represent deep problems in applied mathematics that involve many different populations interacting with each other at a variety of different rates on different spatial scales. We believe that these problems are as deep and as challenging as any in physics or pure mathematics. When Darwin stared at the tangled bank he began to appreciate the complexity of this challenge. Today he would be shocked at the urgency that we need to bring into solving the many facets of this problem and applying the insights gained into the conservation of biological diversity. The time available for many species may be less than the time since Darwin published the Origin . 1644:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In ecosystems a single extinction event can give rise to multiple secondary extinctions. Conservation effort would benefit from tools that help forecast the consequences of species removal. One such tool is the dominator tree a graph theoretic algorithm that when applied to food webs unfolds their complex architecture yielding a simpler topology made of linear pathways that are essential for energy delivery. Each species along these chains is responsible for passing energy to the taxa that follow it and as such it is indispensable for their survival. To assess the predictive potential of the dominator tree we compare its predictions with the effects that followed the collapse of the capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the Barents Sea ecosystem. To this end we first compiled a food web for this ecosystem then we built the corresponding dominator tree and finally we observed whether model predictions matched the empirical observations. This analysis shows the potential and the drawbacks of the dominator trees as a tool for understanding the causes and consequences of extinctions in food webs. 1649:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The central organizing theme of this paper is to discuss the dynamics of the Serengeti grassland ecosystem from the perspective of recent developments in food web theory. The seasonal rainfall patterns that characterize the East African climate create an annually oscillating large scale spatial mosaic of feeding opportunities for the larger ungulates in the Serengeti; this in turn creates a significant annual variation in the food available for their predators. At a smaller spatial scale periodic fires during the dry season create patches of highly nutritious grazing that are eaten in preference to the surrounding older patches of less palatable vegetation. The species interactions between herbivores and plants and carnivores and herbivores are hierarchically nested in the Serengeti food web with the largest bodied consumers on each trophic level having the broadest diets that include species from a large variety of different habitats in the ecosystem. The different major habitats of the Serengeti are also used in a nested fashion; the highly nutritious forage of the short grass plains is available only to the larger migratory species for a few months each year. The longer grass areas the woodlands and kopjes (large partially wooded rocky islands in the surrounding mosaic of grassland) contain species that are resident throughout the year; these species often have smaller body size and more specialized diets than the migratory species. Only the larger herbivores and carnivores obtain their nutrition from all the different major habitat types in the ecosystem. The net effect of this is to create a nested hierarchy of subchains of energy flow within the larger Serengeti food web; these flows are seasonally forced by rainfall and operate at different rates in different major branches of the web. The nested structure that couples sequential trophic levels together interacts with annual seasonal variation in the fast and slow chains of nutrient flow in a way that is likely to be central to the stability of the whole web. If the Serengeti is to be successfully conserved as a fully functioning ecosystem then it is essential that the full diversity of natural habitats be maintained within the greater Serengeti ecosystem. The best way to do this is by controlling the external forces that threaten the boundaries of the ecosystem and by balancing the economic services the park provides between local national and international needs. I conclude by discussing how the ecosystem services provided by the Serengeti are driven by species on different trophic levels. Tourism provides the largest financial revenue to the national economy but it could be better organized to provide more sustained revenue to the park. Ultimately ecotourism needs to be developed in ways that take lessons from the structure of the Serengeti food webs and in ways that provide tangible benefits to people living around the park while also improving the experience of all visitors. 1651:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The robustness of ecosystems to species losses is a central question in ecology given the current pace of extinctions and the many species threatened by human impacts including habitat destruction and climate change. Robustness from the perspective of secondary extinctions has been addressed in the context of food webs to consider the complex network of species interactions that underlie responses to perturbations. In silico removal experiments have examined the structural properties of food webs that enhance or hamper the robustness of ecosystems to species losses with a focus on the role of hubs the most connected species. Here we take a different approach and focus on the role of the connections themselves. We show that trophic links can be divided into functional and redundant based on their contribution to robustness. The analysis of empirical webs shows that hubs are not necessarily the most important species as they may hold many redundant links. Furthermore the fraction of functional connections is high and constant across systems regardless of size and interconnectedness. The main consequence of this scaling pattern is that ecosystem robustness can be considerably reduced by species extinctions even when these do not result in any secondary extinctions. This introduces the possibility of tipping points in the collapse of ecosystems. 1668:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Comparative research on food web structure has revealed generalities in trophic organization produced simple models and allowed assessment of robustness to species loss. These studies have mostly focused on free living species. Recent research has suggested that inclusion of parasites alters structure. We assess whether such changes in network structure result from unique roles and traits of parasites or from changes to diversity and complexity. We analyzed seven highly resolved food webs that include metazoan parasite data. Our analyses show that adding parasites usually increases link density and connectance (simple measures of complexity) particularly when including concomitant links (links from predators to parasites of their prey). However we clarify prior claims that parasites   dominate   food web links. Although parasites can be involved in a majority of links in most cases classic predation links outnumber classic parasitism links. Regarding network structure observed changes in degree distributions 14 commonly studied metrics and link probabilities are consistent with scale dependent changes in structure associated with changes in diversity and complexity. Parasite and free living species thus have similar effects on these aspects of structure. However two changes point to unique roles of parasites. First adding parasites and concomitant links strongly alters the frequency of most motifs of interactions among three taxa reflecting parasites roles as resources for predators of their hosts driven by trophic intimacy with their hosts. Second compared to free living consumers many parasites feeding niches appear broader and less contiguous which may reflect complex life cycles and small body sizes. This study provides new insights about generic versus unique impacts of parasites on food web structure extends the generality of food web theory gives a more rigorous framework for assessing the impact of any species on trophic organization identifies limitations of current food web models and provides direction for future structural and dynamical models. 1683:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Most ecological models assume that predator and prey populations interact solely through consumption: predators reduce prey densities by killing and consuming individual prey. However predators can also reduce prey densities by forcing prey to adopt costly defensive strategies. We build on a simple Lotka Volterra predator prey model to provide a heuristic tool for distinguishing between the demographic effects of consumption (consumptive effects) and of anti predator defenses (nonconsumptive effects) and for distinguishing among the multiple mechanisms by which anti predator defenses might reduce prey population growth rates. We illustrate these alternative pathways for nonconsumptive effects with selected empirical examples and use a meta analysis of published literature to estimate the mean effect size of each pathway. Overall predation risk tends to have a much larger impact on prey foraging behavior than measures of growth survivorship or fecundity. While our model provides a concise framework for understanding the many potential NCE pathways and their relationships to each other our results confirm empirical research showing that prey are able to partially compensate for changes in energy income mitigating the fitness effects of defensive changes in time budgets. Distinguishing the many facets of nonconsumptive effects raises some novel questions and will help guide both empirical and theoretical studies of how predation risk affects prey dynamics. 1687:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Uncertainty persists over the environmental effects of genetically engineered crops that produce the insecticidal Cry proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). We performed meta analyses on a modified public database to synthesize current knowledge about the effects of Bt cotton maize and potato on the abundance and interactions of arthropod non target functional guilds. We compared the abundance of predators parasitoids omnivores detritivores and herbivores under scenarios in which neither only the non Bt crops or both Bt and non Bt crops received insecticide treatments. Predators were less abundant in Bt cotton compared to unsprayed non Bt controls. As expected fewer specialist parasitoids of the target pest occurred in Bt maize fields compared to unsprayed non Bt controls but no significant reduction was detected for other parasitoids. Numbers of predators and herbivores were higher in Bt crops compared to sprayed non Bt controls and type of insecticide influenced the magnitude of the difference. Omnivores and detritivores were more abundant in insecticide treated controls and for the latter guild this was associated with reductions of their predators in sprayed non Bt maize. No differences in abundance were found when both Bt and non Bt crops were sprayed. Predator to prey ratios were unchanged by either Bt crops or the use of insecticides; ratios were higher in Bt maize relative to the sprayed non Bt control. Overall we find no uniform effects of Bt cotton maize and potato on the functional guilds of non target arthropods. Use of and type of insecticides influenced the magnitude and direction of effects; insecticde effects were much larger than those of Bt crops. These meta analyses underscore the importance of using controls not only to isolate the effects of a Bt crop per se but also to reflect the replacement of existing agricultural practices. Results will provide researchers with information to design more robust experiments and will inform the decisions of diverse stakeholders regarding the safety of transgenic insecticidal crops. 170:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In many natural systems individuals compete with conspecifics and heterospecifics for food and in some cases individuals have been observed to partition their foraging times or fight over food. In this study I investigated when it is optimal for a consumer to partition time and be aggressive. I formulated an individual based model of foraging and used game theory to find evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) that maximize the probability that consumers survive each day and acquire their daily food requirements. Consumers choose when to forage and when to behave aggressively during confrontations over food. Consumers are each associated with a state variable representing the amount of food eaten and a dominance ranking which describes how likely they are to forage and fight for food. The ESS is sensitive to food abundance consumer state and the dominance ranking. When food is abundant temporal partitioning is often an ESS where the dominant consumer forages first; however partitioning is unlikely to be an ESS when food abundance is low. Fights over food are typically avoided but may be part of an ESS when food abundance is low both consumers are hungry or the time available for foraging each day is drawing to a close. Because the ESS is sensitive to consumer state the stochastic nature of finding food often results in considerable variation in observed foraging dynamics from one day to the next even when consumers adopt the same state dependent strategy each day. Results are compared with empirical observations and I discuss implications for consumer coexistence. 1711:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Trophic structure or the distribution of biomass among producers and consumers determines key ecosystem values such as the abundance of infectious harvestable or conservation target species and the storage and cycling of carbon and nutrients. There has been much debate on what controls ecosystem trophic structure yet the answer is still elusive. Here we show that the nutritional quality of primary producers controls the trophic structure of ecosystems. By increasing the efficiency of trophic transfer higher producer nutritional quality results in steeper ecosystem trophic structure and those changes are more pronounced in terrestrial than in aquatic ecosystems probably due to the more stringent nutritional limitation of terrestrial herbivores. These results explain why ecosystems composed of highly nutritional primary producers feature high consumer productivity fast energy recycling and reduced carbon accumulation. Anthropogenic changes in producer nutritional quality via changes in trophic structure may alter the values and functions of ecosystems and those alterations may be more important in terrestrial ecosystems. 1728:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Consumer and resource control of diversity in plant communities have long been treated as alternative hypotheses. However experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that herbivores and nutrient resources interactively regulate the number and relative abundance of coexisting plant species. Experiments have yielded divergent and often contradictory responses within and among ecosystems and no effort has to date reconciled this empirical variation within a general framework. Using data from 274 experiments from marine freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems we present a cross system analysis of producer diversity responses to local manipulations of resource supply and or herbivory. Effects of herbivory and fertilization on producer richness differed substantially between systems: (i) herbivores reduced species richness in freshwater but tended to increase richness in terrestrial systems; (ii) fertilization increased richness in freshwater systems but reduced richness on land. Fertilization consistently reduced evenness whereas herbivores increased evenness only in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Producer community evenness and ecosystem productivity mediated fertilization and herbivore effects on diversity across ecosystems. Herbivores increased producer richness in more productive habitats and in producer assemblages with low evenness. These same assemblages also showed the strongest reduction in richness with fertilization whereas fertilization increased (and herbivory decreased) richness in producer assemblages with high evenness. Our study indicates that system productivity and producer evenness determine the direction and magnitude of top down and bottom up control of diversity and may reconcile divergent empirical results within and among ecosystems. 1745:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Longstanding theory in behavioral ecology predicts that prey should evolve decreased foraging rates under high predation threat. However an alternative perspective suggests that growth into a size refuge from gape limited predation and the future benefits of large size can outweigh the initial survival costs of intense foraging. Here I evaluate the relative contributions of selection from a gape limited predator (Ambystoma opacum) and spatial location to explanations of variation in foraging growth and survival in 10 populations of salamander larvae (Ambystoma maculatum). Salamander larvae from populations naturally exposed to intense A. opacum predation risk foraged more actively under common garden conditions. Higher foraging rates were associated with low survival in populations exposed to free ranging A. opacurn larvae. Results demonstrate that risky foraging activity can evolve in high predation risk habitats when the dominant predators are gape limited. This finding invites the further exploration of diverse patterns of prey foraging behavior that depends on natural variation in predator size selectivity. In particular prey should adopt riskier behaviors under predation threat than expected under existing risk allocation models if foraging effort directly reduces the duration of risk by growth into a size refuge. Moreover evidence from this study suggests that foraging has evolved over microgeographic scales despite substantial modification by regional gene flow. This interaction between local selection and spatial location suggests a joint role for adaptation and maladaptation in shaping species interactions across natural landscapes which is a finding with implications for dynamics at the population community and metacommunity levels. 1774:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The stability of ecological communities largely depends on the strength of interactions between predators and their prey. Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured nonrandomly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically the cooccurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence the potential for strong community wide effects remains a threat. 1781:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding what maintains species and perpetuates their coexistence in a network of feeding relationships (the food web) is of great importance for biodiversity conservation. A food web can be viewed as consisting of a number of simple subunits called trophic modules. Intraguild predation (IGP) in which a prey and its predator compete for the same resource is one of the best studied trophic modules. According to theory there are two ways to yield a large persistent system from such modules: (i) to use persistent subunits as building blocks or (h) to arrange the subunits in a way that externally supports the nonpersistent subunits. Here I show that the complex food web of the Caribbean marine ecosystem is constructed in both ways. I show that IGP modules which convey internal persistence because of the fact that prey are superior competitors for the resources are overrepresented in the Caribbean ecosystem. The other modules consisting of competitively inferior prey are not persistent in isolation. However competitively inferior prey in these modules tend to receive more advantage from extra module interactions which allows persistence of the IGP module. In addition those exterior interactions tend to be provided by intrinsically persistent IGP modules to prevent cascading extinction of interacting IGP modules. The food web can be viewed as a set of interacting modules nonrandomly arranged to enhance the maintenance of biodiversity. 1794:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecologists have greatly advanced our understanding of the processes that regulate trophic structure and dynamics in ecosystems. However the causes of systematic variation among ecosystems remain controversial and poorly elucidated. Contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in particular have inspired much speculation but only recent empirical quantification. Here we review evidence for systematic differences in energy flow and biomass partitioning between producers and herbivores detritus and decomposers and higher trophic levels. The magnitudes of different trophic pathways vary considerably with less herbivory more decomposers and more detrital accumulation on land. Aquatic terrestrial differences are consistent across the global range of primary productivity indicating that structural contrasts between the two systems are preserved despite large variation in energy input. We argue that variable selective forces drive differences in plant allocation patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments that propagate upward to shape food webs. The small size and lack of structural tissues in phytoplankton mean that aquatic primary producers achieve faster growth rates and are more nutritious to heterotrophs than their terrestrial counterparts. Plankton food webs are also strongly size structured while size and trophic position are less strongly correlated in most terrestrial (and many benthic) habitats. The available data indicate that contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are driven primarily by the growth rate size and nutritional quality of autotrophs. Differences in food web architecture (food chain length the prevalence of omnivory specialization or anti predator defences) may arise as a consequence of systematic variation in the character of the producer community. 1801:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Indirect effects may play an important role in structuring plant communities. Using a spatially explicit model of consumer foraging and plant competition we demonstrate how the relationship between the spatial area over which plants compete and the spatial scale of consumer behaviour can determine the outcome of competition when one plant species provides a refuge for mobile consumers  refuge mediated apparent competition). Once an initial population of the invader is established complete invasion may be inevitable because of an ever advancing invasion front ratchets forward driven by a feeding front of mobile consumers. Because the spatial extent of apparent competition determines the area available for colonization consumers may also dictate the rate at which an invasion occurs. We find that as long as refuge mediated apparent competition is sufficiently localized invasion is possible even in systems characterized by low overall levels of consumer pressure. Moreover we show that a stable equilibrium can result in which both resident and invading plants coexist suggesting that spatial heterogeneity created by refuge mediated apparent competition may be important in mediating coexistence in plant communities. The spatial interplay of consumer behaviour and plant competition may be an under appreciated mechanism affecting the composition diversity and spatial pattern of plant communities. 186:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1900:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Foster . and Steele . raise number of concerns about our recent study. An important aspect of our analyses is that our dependent variables were species abundances not the aggregate trophic values that are traditionally used. Our approach enhances the possibility of detecting either bottom up or top down patterns for individual or groups of species because assumptions about the nature (direct or indirect) of the relationships between species and trophic levels are unnecessary and because it can detect compensatory dynamics within a trophic level that could eliminate aggregate top down or bottom up effects. Foster .s concern about the species highlighted by our analyses likely arises from their expectation that direct trophic links must exist for the results to be valid. We were not assessing whether a trophic cascade existed but instead evaluating the direction of control within communities. Indeed our results may not have emerged from traditional approaches and they highlight the potential importance of indirect effects in controlling community structure. Both Letters express concern that we suggest cause and effect through correlations and not experiments. Despite reliance on correlational relationships large scale studies like ours have a long record of providing new insight through analysis over spatial and temporal scales beyond the reach and budget of experimental study. We focused on the hypothesized mechanisms that would be responsible for either bottomup or top down control__nutrient availability and predator abundance__and then determined the amount of variation explained by these two different groups of variables for algal and mid trophic level abundances. The expected cause and effect are certainly implicit in our study but will require significant resources before they can be tested experimentally. Steele . are correct in noting that multicolinearity can create problems. However our principal objective was to construct the best predictive model for both topdown and bottom up variables a situation in which multicolinearity can be effectively ignored. Nevertheless we limited multicolinearity problems within each different predictor group by eliminating highly multicolinear variables an approach that acts to conservatively decrease significant results (top down control in our case). Furthermore we reported pure top down and bottom up effects which are the amounts of explained variation after eliminating the multicolinearities between the different predictor groups. Contrary to Steele .s expectations top down and spatial or temperature variables were colinear while bottom up and temperature variables were not such that adding multicolinearity to our results would have suggested even stronger top down effects. In addition the results from our cited companion paper show that the combination of wave disturbance and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) explains only 6 PeRcEnT of the variance and in situ temperature explains less than 1 PeRcEnT of the variance in kelp forest community structure based on 18 years of data spanning several strong and weak ENSO events. As we noted the use of satellite derived productivity data in coastal waters has been extensively validated in our study region. Importantly the variation in primary production is sufficient to detect potential bottom up effects despite missing the extreme nutrient limitation encountered at the southern limit of M. pyrifera. Other variables such as geographic location are indeed at least as important as the top down variables we identified. However explaining 20 PeRcEnT of variation in community structure is a notable result and these other variables are largely outside the human influence and so less useful for management purposes. The claim that our results run counter to the literature on kelp forest ecology is untrue and we disagree with the suggestion that bottom up effects offer a more parsimonious explanation of our results. Also the referenced bottom up associations are not tests of nutrient versus predator effects on entire kelp forest communities and counter examples exist as with the monitoring of extreme eutrophication of kelp forests off San Diego that found no effect on kelp forest communities. Consequently compensatory mechanisms among species are likely more important than a simple trophic cascade framework would suggest with these effects driven by top down forces. Our novel approach allowed us to uncover these results and to open up the quest for the mechanisms driving them. 1916:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central problem in ecology is determining the processes that shape the complex networks known as food webs formed by species and their feeding relationships. The topology of these networks is a major determinant of ecosystems dynamics and is ultimately responsible for their responses to human impacts. Several simple models have been proposed for the intricate food webs observed in nature. We show that the three main models proposed so far fail to fully replicate the empirical data and we develop a likelihood based approach for the direct comparison of alternative models based on the full structure of the network. Results drive a new model that is able to generate all the empirical data sets and to do so with the highest likelihood. 1922:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although scores of experiments have examined the ecological consequences of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt) crops debates continue regarding the nontarget impacts of this technology. Quantitative reviews of existing studies are crucial for better gauging risks and improving future risk assessments. To encourage evidence based risk analyses we constructed a searchable database for nontarget effects of Bt crops. A meta analysis of 42 field experiments indicates that nontarget invertebrates are generally more abundant in Bt cotton and Bt maize fields than in nontransgenic fields managed with insecticides. However in comparison with insecticide free control fields certain nontarget taxa are less abundant in Bt fields. 1924:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and fishing influence marine ecosystems worldwide by altering resource availability and food web structure. Metaanalyses of 47 marine mesocosm experiments manipulating nutrients and consumers and of time series data of nutrients plankton and fishes from 20 natural marine systems revealed that nutrients generally enhance phytoplankton biomass and carnivores depress herbivore biomass. However resource and consumer effects attenuate through marine pelagic food webs resulting in a weak coupling between phytoplankton and herbivores. Despite substantial physical and biological variability in marine pelagic ecosystems alterations of resource availability and consumers result in general patterns of community change. 192:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,2003:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large complex networks of ecological interactions with random structure tend invariably to instability. This mathematical relationship between complexity and local stability ignited a debate that has populated ecological literature for more than three decades. Here we show that when species interact as predators and prey systems as complex as the ones observed in nature can still be stable. Moreover stability is highly robust to perturbations of interaction strength and is largely a property of structure driven by predator prey loops with the stability of these small modules cascading into that of the whole network. These results apply to empirical food webs and models that mimic the structure of natural systems as well. These findings are also robust to the inclusion of other types of ecological links such as mutualism and interference competition as long as consumer resource interactions predominate. These considerations underscore the influence of food web structure on ecological dynamics and challenge the current view of interaction strength and long cycles as main drivers of stability in natural communities. 2007:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species coexistence involving trophic interactions has been investigated under two theoretical frameworks partitioning shared resources and accessing exclusive resources. The influence of body size on coexistence is well studied under the exclusive resources framework but has received less attention under the shared resources framework. We investigate body size dependent allometric extensions of a classical MacArthur type model where two consumers compete for two shared resources. The equilibrium coexistence criteria are compared against the general predictions of the alternative framework over exclusive resources. From the asymmetry in body size allometry of resource encounter versus demand our model shows counterintuitively and contrary to the exclusive resource framework that a smaller consumer should be competitively superior across a wide range of supplies of the two resource types. Experimental studies are reviewed to resolve this difference among the two frameworks that arise from their respective assumptions over resource distribution. Another prediction is that the smaller consumer may have relatively stronger control over equilibrium resource abundance and the loss of smaller consumers from a community may induce relatively stronger trophic cascades. Finally from satiating consumers functional response our model predicts that greater difference among resource sizes can allow a broader range of consumer body sizes to coexist and this is consistent with the predictions of the alternative framework over exclusive resources. Overall this analysis provides an objective comparison of the two alternative approaches to understand species coexistence that have heretofore developed in relative isolation. It advances classical consumer resource theory to show how body size can be an important factor in resource competition and coexistence. 2013:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article analyzes the classical 2 resource 1 consumer apparent competition community module with the Holling type II functional response. Two types of resource regulation (top down vs. combined top down and bottom up) and two types of consumer behaviors (inflexible consumers with fixed preferences for resources vs. adaptive consumers) are considered. When resources grow exponentially and consumers are inflexible foragers one resource is always outcompeted due to strong apparent competition. Density dependent resource growth relaxes apparent competition so that resources can coexist. As multiple attractors (either equilibria or limit cycles) coexist population dynamics and community composition depend on initial population densities. Population dynamics change dramatically when consumers forage adaptively. In this case the results both for top down and combined top down and bottom up regulation are similar and they show that species persistence occurs for a much larger set of parameter values when compared with inflexible consumers. Moreover population dynamics will be chaotic when resource carrying capacities are high enough. This shows that adaptive consurner switching can destabilize population dynamics. 2014:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,This article explores effects of adaptive intraguild predation on species coexistence and community structure in three species food webs. Two Lotka Volterra models that assume a trade off between competition and predation strength are considered in detail. The first model does not explicitly model resource dynamics and is considered with both nonadaptive and adaptive intraguild predation; in the latter case predators choose their diet in order to maximize their instantaneous population growth rate. The second model includes resource population dynamics. Effects of adaptive intraguild predation on the community structure along a gradient in environment productivity are analyzed and compared with some experimental results of protist food webs. Conditions under which intraguild predation is adaptive are discussed for both models. It is proved that if intraguild predators are perfect optimizers then intraguild predation should decrease with increasing environmental productivity and adaptive intraguild predation is a stabilizing factor provided environmental productivity is high enough.2021:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As Wilby notes our article describes how pocket gophers directly affect the physical environment and thereby influence trophic and other ecological interactions. We agree with many of Wilbys comments particularly the notion that influences of ecosystem engineering can be mediated through effects on the physical environment and we find his remarks constructive. We understand the point that efforts by Wilby and his colleagues are directed toward formalizing the general concept of ecosystem engineering however strong or weak the influences. However we believe that many discussions about ecosystem engineering are trivialized by categorizing virtually every impact by organisms as engineering without quantifying the nature and scope of the influences. This is not to say that the broad definition is incorrect but rather that relatively few of all of the impacts that organisms have on the physical environment generate significant influences on ecological processes even though it is likely that virtually every impact on the physical environment modulates the availability of resources to other organisms. Given that physical alteration of the environment by organisms is widespread we believe that the most productive research at this point is to quantify the strength of these interactions on ecological systems. Are there systems in which impacts are particularly strong or persistent? Are there organisms that have particularly strong effects on the environment? For example the physical media in which organisms live vary greatly in their degree of elasticity. Alteration of relatively inelastic soil will have longer term effects than will alteration of fluid media such as water. Accordingly we suggest that the magnitude of the biotically driven physical influences must be relatively large to be of particular import. The same is true with trophic interactions. All organisms have some form of trophic interaction many are important but most are not very significant except to the consumer and the consumed. We should note that this does not imply that the pioneering work by Wilby and his colleagues is trivial but rather that the concept could become diluted much like the niche concept did decades ago by applying it to all cases. As an ancillary issue we believe that the term itself is unfortunate because engineering implies a purposeful act (although we are certain that this is not the intent of the phrase.) Furthermore we believe that trophic interactions and ecosystem engineering are not equivalent concepts. Rather ecosystem engineering is to a broader concept (disturbance?) what predation or herbivory are to trophic interactions. That is it is a specific subset of influences in a larger phenomenon. Perhaps as Wilby notes it is the term that is trivial rather than the concept. 2040:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Food chain length is a central characteristic of ecological communities that has attracted considerable attention for over 75 years because it strongly affects community structure ecosystem processes and contaminant concentrations. Conventional wisdom holds that either resource availability or dynamical stability limit food chain length; however new studies and new techniques challenge the conventional wisdom and broaden the discourse on food chain length. Recent results suggest that resource availability limits food chain length only in systems with very low resource availability and call into question the theoretical basis for dynamical stability as a determinant of food chain length. Evidence currently points towards a complex and contingent framework of interacting constraints that includes the history of community organization resource availability the type of predator prey interactions disturbance and ecosystem size. Within this framework the debate has shifted from a search for singular explanations to a search for when and where different constraints operate to determine food chain length. 2050:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, New studies are documenting trophic cascades in theoretically unlikely systems such as tropical forests and the open ocean. Together with increasing evidence of cascades there is a deepening understanding of the conditions that promote and inhibit the transmission of predatory effects. These conditions include the relative productivity of ecosystems presence of refuges and the potential for compensation. However trophic cascades are also altered by humans. Analyses of the extirpation of large animals reveal loss of cascades and the potential of conservation to restore not only predator populations but also the ecosystem level effects that ramify from their presence. 2059:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent advances in the ecology of food webs underscore the importance of detritus and indirect predator prey effects. However most research considers detritus as an invariable pool and predation as the only interaction between carnivores and prey. Carrion consumption scavenging is a type of detrital feeding that should have widespread consequences for the structure and stability of food webs. Providing access to high quality resources facultative scavenging is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically widespread strategy. In this review we argue that scavenging is underestimated by 16 fold in food web research producing inflated predation rates and underestimated indirect effects. Furthermore more energy is generally transferred per link via scavenging than predation. Thus future food web research should consider scavenging especially in light of how major global changes can affect scavengers. 2060:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent efforts to include parasites in food webs have drawn attention to a previously ignored facet of foraging ecology: parasites commonly function as prey within ecosystems. Because of the high productivity of parasites their unique nutritional composition and their pathogenicity in hosts their consumption affects both food web topology and disease risk in humans and wildlife. Here we evaluate the ecological evolutionary and epidemiological significance of feeding on parasites including concomitant predation grooming predation on free living stages and intraguild predation. Combining empirical data and theoretical models we show that consumption of parasites is neither rare nor accidental and that it can sharply affect parasite transmission and food web properties. Broader consideration of predation on parasites will enhance our understanding of disease control food web structure and energy transfer and the evolution of complex life cycles. 206:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,245:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,266:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,267:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,301:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Conservation of marine species through fisheries management and no take marine reserves have focused primarily on single species but such protection may influence the target species predators prey competitors or mutualists. Conversely successful protection may depend on responses of these other species. Empirical data and previous theory indicate that fisheries status and life history attributes strongly influence species responses to protection. Both direct effects and indirect effects of protection (through species interactions) have been documented. A predator prey model depicting the dynamics of two species in a two patch habitat (a no take reserve and a fished area) revealed conditions under which the predator and prey may decline after reserve establishment. Not surprisingly model results suggest that management scenarios and life history traits leading to high predator population growth are more likely to produce prey declines following reserve establishment. Interestingly trade offs between enhancing predator and enhancing prey occurred at low fishing intensities regardless of the prey and predator life history traits. At high fishing rates reserve establishment generally outweighed predation effects and resulted in increased abundance of both predator and prey. Simple spatial models can help determine the range of possible responses of interacting species to protection and can yield some general insights for their management. 30:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Some of the most interesting and important questions in ecology require examination of the strength of different processes across environmental gradients and among organisms with different traits. Metaanalysis combines results from independent studies to examine patterns of effect across taxa or environments and thus may represent a powerful tool to test ecological theory. A meta analysis requires that a common metric of effect size be extracted from each of the studies. Here we focus on choosing a metric that best facilitates ecological inferences. We begin with a brief description of the standard definition of effect size in meta analysis as used in recent papers. We then discuss potential problems with this approach and suggest an alternative that is more explicitly tied to the dynamics of ecological systems. Using two examples drawn from predator prey experiments we then illustrate the limitations of the standard metric and the conceptual advantages of one ecologically based alternative. We conclude by discussing the link between metrics of effect size and ecological models. 319:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,319:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Cannibalism is a widespread phenomenon that can have strong population and community effects. In this study I compare the prey size predator size relationships of diets with and without cannibalized prey for four piscivorous species and five populations that are commonly cannibalistic and where large databases exist. I then examine the resultant trophic niche breadths (range of relative prey size consumed) to quantify whether inclusion of cannibalized prey in the diet slows down the decline in trophic niche breadth that many large predators exhibit as they grow. When comparing diets including cannibalized prey with those without consistent differences were found among all predator species. In all cases the slope of the upper bound of the predator size prey size scatters was larger for cannibal predators compared with noncannibals suggesting selectivity for larger cannibal prey which may be driven by higher rates of size dependent capture success with familiar prey. The slopes of the upper bounds of the cannibal relative prey size vs. predator size scatter also tended to be larger than the upper bound slopes for diets without conspecific prey. Finally for all species mean trophic breadth of diets including cannibalized prey were larger than those not including cannibal prey suggesting that relatively large prey sizes may always be available for cannibals. 325:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,334:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predator dependent functional responses decouple predation mortality from fluctuations in predator abundance and therefore can prevent strong   top down   interaction strengths in food webs. We evaluated whether contrasts in the functional response of Baltic Sea cod (Gadus morhua) were consistent with the contrasting population dynamics of two prey species herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus): sprat abundance increased nearly threefold following a sharp decline in the cod population (a strong interaction) whereas herring abundance failed to increase (a weak interaction). We found striking differences in the functional response of cod on alternative prey and these were consistent with the observed patterns in interaction strengths. Cod predation was the dominant source of mortality for age 1 and age 2 sprat but was only important for age 1 herring. Moreover the magnitude of predation mortality on age 1 and age 2 sprat was highly sensitive to cod biomass whereas predation mortality on herring was only moderately sensitive to cod biomass. These analyses suggest the possibility that food webs are comprised of linkages that vary with respect to the magnitude and importance of predation mortality and how this mortality varies with changes in predator abundance. 335:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain diel vertical migration (DVM); however they have generally been applied to DVM behavior of a single trophic level. We evaluate the costs (predation risk) and benefits (foraging rate and growth rate potential) of different hypothetical and observed DVM trajectories for a three level pelagic food chain in Lake Superior containing opossum shrimp (Mysis relicta) deepwater ciscoes (Coregonus spp.) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Lake trout appear to be maximizing foraging and growth rates by tracking vertically migrating ciscoes while the DVM trajectories of ciscoes suggests a trade off between predation risk and growth. For ciscoes two alternative DVM trajectories both minimize the ratio of risk to growth: a shallow trajectory that follows low light levels down to 80 m during the day and a deep trajectory (below 150 m) that tracks highest Mysis densities. Observed cisco DVM trajectories appear to follow the shallow high risk high growth trajectory in 2001 but switch to the deep low risk low growth trajectory in 2004 when lake trout density was higher and the density of ciscoes was lower. 33:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A mathematical model is presented that describes a system where two consumer species compete exploitatively for a single renewable resource. The resource is distributed in a patchy but homogeneous environment; that is all patches are intrinsically identical. The two consumer species are referred to as diggers and grazers where diggers deplete the resource within a patch to lower densities than grazers. We show that the two distinct feeding strategies can produce a heterogeneous resource distribution that enables their coexistence. Coexistence requires that grazers must either move faster than diggers between patches or convert the resources to population growth much more efficiently than diggers. The model shows that the functional form of resource renewal within a patch is also important for coexistence. These results contrast with theory that considers exploitation competition for a single resource when the resource is assumed to be well mixed throughout the system. 340:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,340:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The distribution of fishes is influenced by a host of physico chemical and biological variables including temperature and oxygen prey abundance feeding or assimilation rates and predation risk. We used hydroacoustics and midwater trawls to measure the vertical distribution of pelagic fishes during a series of research cruises on Lake Superiors western arm in 2001 and 2004. Our objective was to assess vertical structuring in the fish assemblage over varying light levels. We observed variability in vertical structuring of both ciscoes (Coregonus spp.) and their primary predator the siscowet (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet). Our results indicate that deepwater predators and prey migrate extensively over a diel cycle. This migration pattern is most consistent with changes in the distribution of prey resources for siscowet and diel variability in predation risk controlled by changing light levels for ciscoes. The magnitude of vertical migration in ciscoes increased with higher abundance of siscowets supporting predation risk as a driver of cisco distribution. This study describes the extent of vertical migration in each group of fish provides a statistical description of the pattern and discusses the implications for trophic interactions in the Lake Superior food web. 342:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) is based on a bioenergetic expression of fish growth; therefore size at age data can theoretically be used to estimate fish consumption rates. We evaluated the accuracy of VBGF derived consumption rates by performing a meta analysis and sensitivity analysis of VBGF assumptions and we used Bayesian parameter estimation to quantify uncertainty in these estimates. The VBGF was robust to its assumption regarding the allometry of catabolism but was highly sensitive to the assumed allometry of consumption. Consequently the commonly used form (  specialized   VBGF) which makes a strong assumption regarding the allometric slope of consumption often grossly underestimates ( 50 PeRcEnT) consumption. The precision of the VBGF depended on characteristics of the size at age data used to parameterize the model. When data indicate decelerating growth consumption rates were estimated with good precision; we estimated a 70 PeRcEnT probability that bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) consumption rates were between 1 and 2 PeRcEnT body mass per day. Otherwise consumption estimates were poorly defined; yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) consumption rates between 2 and 7 PeRcEnT per day were all equally likely. We conclude that VBGF can be a useful tool for estimating fish consumption rates but potential biases and precision of these estimates should be evaluated on a case by case basis. 349:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, While crayfish are traditionally considered fish prey they are capable of feeding on substrate bound fish eggs and their introductions have been blamed for the decline in fish populations in Europe and North America. To investigate their potential effects on fish reproductive success we measured the effects of a native crayfish (Orconectes virilis) on the reproductive success of two substrate nesting sunfish pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in replicated pond experiments. Crayfish were observed feeding on eggs in both experiments. Crayfish presence delayed successful reproduction by pumpkinseeds in densely vegetated ponds resulting in lower young of the year biomass in ponds with crayfish. In the second experiment with bluegills in less vegetated ponds crayfish prevented successful reproduction entirely. However when we added crayfish proof exclosures to the crayfish ponds late in the summer bluegills located the crayfish free habitat and successfully reproduced inside the exclosures (1 month after first successful reproduction in control ponds). The results of these experiments demonstrate the potential strong negative effects of crayfish on sunfish reproduction and suggest that the spatial distribution of crayfish and other egg predators may influence fish nesting behaviors and habitat choices. Further studies are needed to determine the magnitude of crayfish effects in natural lakes and ponds where sunfish and crayfish co occur. 34:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A model for prey and predators is formulated in which three essential nutrients can limit growth of both populations. Prey take up dissolved nutrients while predators ingest prey assimilate a fraction of ingested nutrients that depends on their current nutrient status and recycle the balance. Although individuals are modeled as identical within populations amounts of nutrients within individuals vary over time in both populations with reproductive rates increasing with these amounts. Equilibria and their stability depend on nutrient supply conditions. When nutrient supply increases unusual results can occur such as a decrease of prey density. This phenomenon occurs if with increasing nutrient predators sequester rather than recycle nutrients. Furthermore despite use of a linear functional response for predators high nutrient supply can destabilize equilibria. Responses to nutrient supply depend on the balance between assimilation and recycling of nutrients by predators which differs depending on the identity of the limiting nutrient. Applied to microbial ecosystems the model predicts that the efficiency of organic carbon mineralization is reduced when supply of mineral nutrients is low and when equilibria are unstable. The extent to which predators recycle or sequester limiting nutrients for their prey is of critical importance for the stability of predator prey systems and their response to enrichment. 369:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,387:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,388:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,393:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,401:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,403:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,445:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,457:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,48:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Central place foragers such as ants beavers and colonial seabirds can act as biological conduits subsidizing local communities with allochthonous resources. To explore the consequences of such biologically vectored resource redistribution we draw on an example from cave ecology and develop a population level model of central place foraging based on the dispersal kernel framework. We explore how the size of the patch in which central place foraging occurs and the spatial distribution of foragers within that patch feed back to influence the population dynamics of the central place forager and the species richness of the associated recipient community. We demonstrate that the particular way in which a population of central place foragers uses space has two important effects. First space use determines the stability of the forager population and establishes patch size thresholds for persistence stable equilibria and limit cycles. Second alternative foraging kernels lead to qualitatively different scaling relationships between the size of the foraging patch and species richness back at the central place. These analyses provide a new link among elements of ecology related to animal behavior population dynamics and species diversity while also providing a novel perspective on the utility of integrodifference equations for problems in spatial ecology. 522:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Equilibrium models are increasingly employed in applied ecology but often because of experimental logistics only short term laboratory experiments are performed. Here we use simple models to examine the management relevance of this disconnection between theory and experiments in communities with intraguild predation (IGP). Equilibrium theory shows that IGP can promote coexistence of competitors on a shared resource. However adding the intraguild predator can result in higher resource densities than in a system with the intraguild prey alone with its resource. This has important management implications when the shared resource is a pest species whose population is controlled by natural enemies. Our models demonstrate why short term experiments and studies ignoring alternate resources may bear no relationship to a system at equilibrium. Short term experiments quantifying only attack rates can predict a broad range of outcomes. By ignoring conversion efficiency consumer longevity and immigration short term studies may for example cause erroneous decisions about the introduction of natural enemies in biological control. Thus attack rates conversion efficiencies and immigration rates must all be quantified for a thorough long term understanding of IGP in field systems. 524:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,56:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Concern about climate change has spurred experimental tests of how warming affects species abundance and performance. As this body of research grows interpretation and extrapolation to other species and systems have been limited by a lack of theory. To address the need for theory for how warming affects species interactions we used consumer prey models and the metabolic theory of ecology to develop quantitative predictions for how systematic differences between the temperature dependence of heterotrophic and autotrophic population growth lead to temperature dependent herbivory. We found that herbivore and plant abundances change with temperature in proportion to the ratio of autotrophic to heterotrophic metabolic temperature dependences. This result is consistent across five different formulations of consumer prey models and over varying resource supply rates. Two models predict that temperature dependent herbivory causes primary producer abundance to be independent of temperature. This finding contradicts simpler extensions of metabolic theory to abundance that ignore trophic interactions and is consistent with patterns in terrestrial ecosystems. When applied to experimental data the model explained 77 PeRcEnT and 66 PeRcEnT of the variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances respectively. We suggest that metabolic theory provides a foundation for understanding the effects of temperature change on multitrophic ecological communities. 579:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,59:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,59:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Disparities in nutrient content (nitrogen and phosphorus) between herbivores and their plant resources have lately proven to have major consequences for herbivore success consumer driven nutrient cycling and the fate of primary production in ecosystems. Here we extend these findings by examining patterns of nutrient content between animals at higher trophic levels specifically between insect herbivores and predators. Using a recently compiled database on insect nutrient content we found that predators exhibit on average 15 PeRcEnT greater nitrogen content than herbivores. This difference persists after accounting for variation from phylogeny and allometry. Among herbivorous insects we also found evidence that recently derived lineages (e. g. herbivorous Diptera and Lepidoptera) have on a relative basis 15 PeRcEnT 25 PeRcEnT less body nitrogen than more ancient herbivore lineages (e. g. herbivorous Orthoptera and Hemiptera). We elaborate several testable hypotheses for the origin of differences in nitrogen content between trophic levels and among phylogenetic lineages. For example interspecific variation in insect nitrogen content may be directly traceable to differences in dietary nitrogen (including dilution by gut contents) selected for directly in response to the differential scarcity of dietary nitrogen or an indirect consequence of adaptation to different feeding habits. From some functional perspectives the magnitude rather than the source of the interspecific differences in nitrogen content may be most critical. We conclude by discussing the implications of the observed patterns for both the trophic complexity of food webs and the evolutionary radiation of herbivorous insects. 609:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,615:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Current human land use activities are altering many components of the river landscape resulting in unstable channels. Instability may have serious negative consequences for water quality aquatic and riparian habitat and for river related human infrastructure such as bridges and roads. Resource management agencies have developed rapid bioassessment surveys to help assess stability in a fast and cost effective way. While this assessment can be done for a single site fairly rapidly it is still time consuming to apply over large watersheds and assessment activities must be prioritized. We constructed a system that employs commonly available map data as inputs to cost sensitive variants of decision tree algorithms to predict the relative channel stability of different sites. In particular we use bagged lazy option trees (LOTs) and bagged probability estimation trees (PETs) to identify all unstable channels while making the smallest number of errors of classifying stable channels as unstable thereby minimizing cost and maximizing safety. We measured the performance of the classifiers using ROC curves and found that the PETs performed better than the LOTs in situations where the number of instances of the stable and unstable classes were relatively balanced but the LOTs did better where unstable examples were relatively rare compared to stable perhaps due to the LOTs ability to focus on individual examples. 629:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Traditionally optimal foraging theory has been applied to situations in which a forager makes decisions about current resource consumption based on tradeoffs in resource attributes  caloric intake versus handling time). Food storage which permits animals to manage the availability of food in space and time adds a complex dimension to foraging decisions and may influence the predictions of traditional foraging theory. One key question about the role of caching behavior in optimal foraging theory is the degree to which information about future value might influence foraging decisions. To investigate this question we use a simple prey selection model that minimizes the time spent foraging and is modified to include food storage and changes in nutritional value through time. We used simulations to evaluate time spent in foraging activities per prey item and optimal foraging strategies  cache versus consume immediately) for 3125 parameter combinations representing different abundance levels handling times. and nutritional values. Using discriminant function analysis it was possible to distinguish situations where   caching   versus   immediate consumption   were optimal strategies with abundance as the single predictive variable. The circumstances where caching was optimal were characterized by a decline in prey abundance and an increase in nutritional value through time. These results provide a framework for identifying subtle differences in foraging behavior when future value is accounted for thereby improving our predictive understanding of how caching animals forage. 62:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Herbivory often operates through a feedback in which herbivores affect the success and location of plants which in turn affects the foraging behavior of animals. Factors other than food such as social behavior may influence the interactions between herbivores and the plants they consume. We used a simulation model to compare the effects of foraging and social behavior on plant distribution and foraging efficiency by gophers (Thomomys bottae) in a system characteristic of California grasslands. In this system annual forbs are the preferred food items and their abundance increases in areas disturbed by gopher burrowing. In addition gopher social interactions generate buffer zones between adjacent burrows. During the first year of the simulations before gophers affected the plant community feeding efficiency declined with increased gopher density. However after 40 yr annual plant abundance increased with increasing gopher density yielding higher maximum gopher density and per capita foraging efficiency. Conversely increased width of the buffer zones lowered maximum gopher density and annual plant abundance resulting in lower feeding efficiency. In addition the compact burrow structure of gophers employing an area restricted search strategy allowed a higher density of gophers to coexist resulting in higher annual plant abundance and higher per capita food capture rates. 630:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding coexistence is a central concern for community ecologists. The limited combination of parameter values over which coexistence can occur in most models of competing species suggests that coexistence may not be a general phenomenon yet observations of communities demonstrate that coexistence of competitors is common. In this paper I use a well studied host parasitoid system California red scale and its parasitoids to explore whether intraguild predation (IGP) is a likely coexistence mechanism for these species and to motivate an exploration of how the level of biological detail in theoretical models influences conclusions about the likelihood of coexistence via IGR Although prior work has shown that parasitoid and host densities in the field follow the patterns predicted by simple IGP theory in this detailed model parameterized with empirically derived values coexistence is not predicted. Thus in spite of the concordance between field observations and simple model predictions the current model demonstrates that IGP is unlikely to be the sole coexistence mechanism for the parasitoids of California red scale. Furthermore IGP is an equalizing coexistence mechanism and these results demonstrate that adding biological detail to this type of mechanism does not substantially increase the predicted coexistence region. This important result adds to the growing literature showing that simple models often can capture the fundamental processes operating in more complex models and may be sufficient to capture underlying ecological patterns. Because models lacking system specific details are better able to produce general conclusions the current result suggests that general theory may be used to gain insights into a diversity of ecological systems. 634:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Herbivores can affect plants not only directly through browsing and trampling but also indirectly through other species. For example herbivores could affect the interaction between plants and their pollinators. Because plant population density may affect plant pollinator interactions and plant reproductive success we hypothesized that herbivores could affect pollination and plant reproduction indirectly by modifying plant population density. Unlike previous hypotheses which concerned individual level effects on vegetative and reproductive traits our hypothesis focuses on population level effects and involves a feedback mechanism: To test this hypothesis we conducted field studies in the temperate forest of the southern Andes where introduced ungulates are a major source of anthropogenic alteration. For 10 animal pollinated understory plants we compared population density pollinator visitation pollen deposition in stigmas and reproduction in four pairs of grazed and ungrazed sites. We found evidence of indirect effects of ungulates on pollination and reproduction only for the herb Alstroemeria aurea (Alstroemeriaceae). The general lack of evidence for indirect effects on most of the species may result from resistance to cattle browsing and trampling or low statistical power. For A. aurea we present additional evidence from trampling and hand pollination experiments plus path analyses of the effect of density on pollination and reproduction showing that: (1) cattle decrease the absolute and relative population density of this species through trampling; (2) density particularly relative density affects pollen deposition on stigmas; and (3) conspecific pollen deposition affects reproduction. Thus our results indicate that by directly reducing the population density of A. aurea cattle are indirectly affecting its reproduction. 643:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Previous syntheses have identified the key roles that phylogeny body size and trophic level play in determining arthropod stoichiometry. To date however detritivores have been largely omitted from such syntheses despite their importance in nutrient cycling biodiversity and food web interactions. Here we report on a compiled database of the allometry and nutritional stoichiometry (N and P) of detritivorous arthropods. Overall both N and P content for detritivores varied among major phylogenetic lineages. Detritivore N content was similar to the N content of herbivores but below that of predators. By contrast detritivore P content was independent of trophic level. Contrary to previous reports neither nutrient varied with body size. This analysis places detritivores in the context of related herbivores and predators and as such sets the stage for future investigations into the causes and consequences of elemental (mis)matches between detritivores and their detrital resources. 647:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predation has long influenced how ecologists think about ecological processes from the small to the large. At the microscale predation related stress can yield permanent changes in prey physiology or morphology; at the macroscale altered predation regimes in grazer dominated systems can profoundly alter ecosystem function. Recently many ecologists have become interested in the nonconsumptive effects (NCE) of predators; broadly the consequences of defensive strategies employed by prey in response to predation risk. This body of research grew out of reductionist behavioral studies of how prey foraging tactics shifted in response to risk. As a result this field of study has sometimes been considered a specialized offshoot of trophic or behavioral ecology. This is especially understandable in light of the difficulty in empirically distinguishing between NCE and consumptive predator effects. Understanding these effects is essential however since predator NCE on prey growth life history resource use etc. can enhance or obscure consumptive effects and make it difficult to predict the community level outcome of predator prey and predator prey resource interactions. The aim of this Special Feature is to show that NCE are often central to analyses of consumer resource interactions especially those that occur in spatially structured multispecies systems. We build on the groundwork laid by a 2003 Ecology Special Feature that highlighted NCE research via a series of synthetic theoretical and empirically based papers that explored individual trait plasticity in ecological communities. The intervening five years have seen an explosion of interest in and increased awareness of NCE by community ecologists and recognition that their significance may extend well beyond trophic interactions. This Special Feature explores some of the exciting advances in NCE research by reviewing our increased understanding of the central importance of NCE to ecological processes across multiple levels of organization. It includes papers examining NCE in classic predator prey studies their import to spatial ecology and their effects on ecosystem level processes. All three papers highlight the larger scale consequences of non consumptive interactions between predators and their prey and illustrate that NCE may extend a predators reach far beyond its immediate grasp. The Special Feature starts with an article by B. Peckarsky and colleagues that reviews the role of NCE in several textbook examples of predator prey interactions in order to introduce this concept to readers previously unfamiliar with the topic. They first explore the influence of NCE on the boreal lynx hare cycle as well as in aquatic trophic cascades (both marine and freshwater). The available evidence suggests that NCE play an integral role that may be overlooked unless NCE affect prey in a direction opposite that expected from the consumptive predator effect  increasing rather than decreasing prey density). The classic predator prey interaction between wolves and moose on Isle Royale has also demonstrated that the impact of NCE varies as a function of climatic conditions. NCE may also play an important role in keystone predation in which a consumer species effect on community structure is disproportional to their biomass. Some keystone predators may achieve this status by acting as intimidators whose relatively minor consumptive effects on prey biomass are magnified by community wide responses to predation risk  predators scare many more prey than they eat). Peckarsky . conclude by highlighting the potential effects of NCE on other ecological processes such as delayed density dependence and predator mediated prey coexistence and they call for a more consistent integration of NCE into community level research. In the second article J. Orrock and colleagues assess the importance of both predator consumption and NCE to metacommunity dynamics a rapidly emerging field of research that addresses the interplay between spatial ecology and interspecific interactions. They use classic models of competition and metapopulation dynamics to explore the implications of predators that affect prey colonization rates (via decreased immigration to and increased emigration from predatorcontaining patches) as well as local prey density. They find that defensive changes in prey movement can alter the dynamics of predator free patches in ways that lead to the predators influence being felt throughout the habitat matrix. Predators can thus exert remote control over ecological processes within sites that they do not occupy. This phenomenon has the potential to profoundly alter spatially structured systems via predator mediated changes in population persistence and susceptibility to habitat loss. These changes can in turn affect competitive hierarchies that structure community diversity. Shifts in the competition colonization trade off in response to predators may have similarly important consequences; even rare or spatially restricted predators can tip the balance between prey coexistence and competitive exclusion. Such predator mediated shifts in spatial dynamics can also affect the chances of biological invasions and intriguingly the ability of communities to respond to anthropogenic habitat destruction. Throughout the article Orrock . emphasize the potential for NCE to have subtle but profound impacts in spatially structured habitats. The third article in the Special Feature takes a large scale view of NCE and examines whether predation risk can affect ecosystem function. Oswald Schmitz and colleagues use a combination of case studies and syntheses to link predator induced alterations in prey foraging behavior to changes in a variety of ecosystem metrics. In old field systems for example predation risk from spiders with different hunting modes generate qualitatively different patterns of plant diversity productivity and nutrient cycling; in marine intertidal zones predation risk alone leads to reduced energy transfer up the food chain via decreased prey growth efficiency. Importantly these patterns are only understandable in light of NCE. This synthesis shows that NCE not only influence but effectively control ecosystem processes in a range of systems. As a result Schmitz and colleagues argue strongly that this linkage of evolutionary and ecosystem ecology possesses substantial explanatory power for resolving the often contingent way ecological processes manifest themselves at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Ultimately this Special Feature aims to introduce NCE to a broad ecological audience by emphasizing that its significance extends well beyond trophic interactions and has important implications for other ecological disciplines. We hope that these papers will spark awareness of and foster research interest into the impacts of these sometimes subtle but often powerful phenomena on a wide array of ecological processes. 656:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A paradigm is a set of mutually supportive hypotheses that provides a frame of reference within a field. In 1962 Kuhn proposed that paradigms form within the dual contexts of empirical evidence and intellectual history. Facts potentially contradictory to a paradigm may not be recognized until they are observed repeatedly and incorporated as supportive evidence into a new theory. Support for this interpretation can be found in the history of a paradigm of predation in rocky intertidal communities. Hypotheses were developed in the contexts of innovative field experiments and historical arguments of competition theory. The resulting paradigm proposed that predators restrict populations of competitively dominant prey to refuges. Different types of refuge or no refuge prevail in different areas of the intertidal zone accounting for patterns of prey distribution the coexistence of natural enemies and the local maintenance of diversity. An ensuing period of criticism made reference to potential contradictions. Rather than by predation alone prey abundances are determined largely by an interplay of varying rates of predation and prey production. Furthermore prey refuges are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain all observed instances of local coexistence of predators and prey. We present a model in which intertidal boundaries of prey are set by equilibria between predation and prey production. Predation and prey productivity vary with environmental Gradients and with explicit spatial configurations of the prey. This synthesis relies on insights of the original paradigm incorporates the contradictory observations and depends on novel capabilities afforded by spatially explicit computer simulations. The resulting synthesis provides explanations for distinctive aspects of zonation including abrupt prey boundaries in continuous gradients of predation and converging upper and lower prey boundaries in gradients of decreasing wave exposure. 662:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although predators affect prey both via consumption and by changing prey migration behavior the interplay between these two effects is rarely incorporated into spatial models of predator prey dynamics and competition among prey. We develop a model where generalist predators have consumptive effects (i. e. altering the likelihood of local prey extinction) as well as nonconsumptive effects (altering the likelihood of colonization) on spatially separated prey populations (metapopulations). We then extend this model to explore the effects of predators on competition among prey. We. find that generalist predators can promote persistence of prey metapopulations by promoting prey colonization but predators can also hasten system wide extinction by either increasing local extinction or reducing prey migration. By altering rates of prey migration predators in one location can exert remote control over prey dynamics in another location via predator mediated changes in prey flux. Thus the effect of predators may extend well beyond the proportion of patches they visit. In the context of prey metacommunities predator mediated shifts in prey migration and mortality can shift the competition colonization trade off among competing prey leading to changes in the prey community as well as changes in the susceptibility of prey species to habitat loss. Consequently native prey communities may be susceptible to invasion not only by exotic prey species that experience reduced amounts of mortality from resident predators but also by exotic prey species that exhibit strong dispersal in response to generalist native predators. Ultimately our work suggests that the consumptive and nonconsumptive effects of generalist predators may have strong yet potentially cryptic effects on competing prey capable of mediating coexistence fostering invasion and interacting with anthropogenic habitat alteration. 664:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although the canonical concept of intraguild predation evokes images of predators and prey several subdisciplines within ecology have developed theory not specifically framed in terms of predation and competition and often using system specific terminology yet functionally quite similar. Here we formulate models combining exploitation and competition in predator prey host parasitoid and host pathogen communities to compare dynamics food web structure and coexistence criteria for these disparate communities. Although dynamic stability in the coexistence region varies strongly among systems in all cases coexistence of two consumers on a single resource occurs only if the intraguild prey species is more efficient than the intraguild predator at suppressing the abundance of the basal resource and if the intraguild predator accrues a sufficient gain from attacking the intraguild prey. In addition equilibrial abundances of all species in all three formulations respond similarly to increases in productivity of the basal resource. Our understanding of predator prey and parasitoid host communities has bene. fited from explicit examination of intraguild predation ( IGP) theory and we suggest that future research examining pathogen communities in particular will benefit substantially from explicit recognition of predictions from IGP theory. 665:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although use of refuge habitats by prey can reduce their risk of predation refuge use may also involve costs such as increased within refuge competition for resources. Despite the ubiquity of refuge use by prey it is unknown whether predator induced use of refuges has widespread negative nonconsumptive effects on prey growth survival and fecundity. We performed a meta analysis of 204 studies of aquatic taxa containing data on 271 distinct predator prey pairs and found strong evidence that the negative effect of predation risk on prey activity growth and fecundity increases when prey have access to refuge habitats. Moreover the effect of refuge habitats on growth and activity depends upon whether the refuge provides partial or total protection from predators. These results suggest that prey choosing whether to use refuges face a trade off between lowering the immediate risk of being consumed and increased nonconsumptive costs of refuge use. Our results suggest that changes in nonconsumptive effects in the presence of refuge habitats may alter prey population dynamics coexistence and metapopulation dynamics. Moreover our results reveal key pragmatic considerations: the magnitude and direction of nonconsumptive effects may depend on the presence of refuge habitat and whether the refuge provides partial or total protection from predators. 667:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An important goal in ecology is developing general theory on how the species composition of ecosystems is related to ecosystem properties and functions. Progress on this front is limited partly because of the need to identify mechanisms controlling functions that are common to a wide range of ecosystem types. We propose that one general mechanism rooted in the evolutionary ecology of all species is adaptive foraging behavior in response to predation risk. To support our claim we present two kinds of empirical evidence from plant based and detritus based food chains of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The. first kind comes from experiments that explicitly trace how adaptive foraging influences ecosystem properties and functions. The second kind comes from a synthesis of studies that individually examine complementary components of particular ecosystems that together provide an integrated perspective on the link between adaptive foraging and ecosystem function. We show that the indirect effects of predators on plant diversity plant productivity nutrient cycling trophic transfer efficiencies and energy. flux caused by consumer foraging shifts in response to risk are qualitatively different from effects caused by reductions in prey density due to direct predation. We argue that a perspective of ecosystem function that considers effects of consumer behavior in response to predation risk will broaden our capacity to explain the range of outcomes and contingencies in trophic control of ecosystems. This perspective also provides an operational way to integrate evolutionary and ecosystem ecology which is an important challenge in ecology. 674:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Communities of coexisting organisms are formed by both dispersal among habitat patches in a region and local interactions within patches. The supply of colonists from the regional pool has the potential to alter the outcome of local interactions by providing species that fill different ecological roles. I examined the consequences of invasion by fish (juvenile Lepomis macrochirus) and insect (Notonecta undulata) predators on experimental plankton communities that were either connected to or isolated from the regional pool of zooplankton species. The effects of predators on zooplankton composition and diversity depended on dispersal by members of the regional zooplankton species pool. Fish and notonectids reduced the abundance of large zooplankton and thereby facilitated invasion by new species from the surrounding region. Both predators reduced zooplankton species richness in the absence of dispersal while fish had positive effects and notonectids had no effects with rapid dispersal. Fish facilitated invasion by more species than they excluded while similar numbers of species invaded with notonectids as were driven extinct. The effects of predators on planktonic trophic structure (zooplankton size structure and biomass. phytoplankton biomass) were independent of the level of dispersal. Both predators reduced zooplankton mean body size but only fish enhanced phytoplankton density. Invasion by members of the regional species pool slightly increased zooplankton mean body size and reduced phytoplankton biomass however the effects were small and independent of the predator treatment. Predator facilitated invasion of new species altered the effects of predators on zooplankton species composition and diversity but not on plankton trophic structure. The results suggest that spatial heterogeneity in predator abundance promotes regional coexistence among zooplankton. Connection to a diverse regional species pool via dispersal may therefore be important for determining the impact of local interactions such as predation on communities. 682:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the importance of understanding persistence there are few direct tests of the ability of models to predict predator and prey population persistence. We tested whether an individual based model could forecast the dynamics and time to extinction in aquatic microcosms of a protist predator and prey: predatory Didinium nasutum and bacterivorous Colpidium striatum. By addressing both persistence and dynamics the model increases the testability of mechanisms of extinction. Population level equations modeled the functional response and prey growth. For individual predators we simulated time since dividing and feeding and number of prey consumed; these influenced the timing of division and death. We tested the model by comparing simulated dynamics to data from three experiments.: (1) an experiment initiated with low predator prey ratios in 30 mL bottles; (2) an experiment similar to Experiment 1 but in which immigrant predators prey or both were added during the first density cycle; (3) an experiment in 30 mL bottles initiated with various predator prey ratios. Using only nine parameters measured in independent experiments simulations gave satisfactory predictions of the period and amplitude of cycles of predator and prey densities and predator and prey densities through time for Experiment 1. Adding stochasticity to the model also allowed it to reproduce observed prey and predator persistence and the proportion of replicates with prey extinctions. We used the improved model to forecast the results of Experiments 2 and In Experiment 2 persistence changed with immigration. The model qualitatively reproduced these changes but underestimated their magnitude. Increasing the initial predator prey ratio reduced persistence in Experiment Simulations failed to qualitatively reproduce these results for 30 mL microcosms unless we raised initial prey density. This study demonstrates the use of an individual based model to help identify and test mechanisms of extinction in predator prey interactions. The combination of individual based and population level formalisms can maintain both model tractability and a close working relationship between models and accessible data. 684:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Different species occupy similar trophic positions in natural communities. However ecologists have often overlooked the consequences of this variation for local communities by assuming that species occupying similar trophic positions are functionally similar. There have been few experimental tests of this important assumption. We tested the assumption of functional similarity by comparing the effect of six different predators (three fish and three salamander species) on an ensemble of larval anuran prey. Our experiment identified substantial variation in the impact of different predators on a variety of responses. Differences among predators in their selection of prey caused the structure of the larval anuran ensemble to vary continuously as opposed to producing discrete alternative states. Predators also differed in their ability to suppress either the total number or biomass of anurans. Thus performance of larval anurans was dependent upon the identity of the predator. Moreover the identity of predators judged similar and their degree of similarity depends on the specific response variable. In our study we found no predominance of weak or strong interactors as predators appear to be evenly distributed along a gradient of interaction strengths. Knowledge of the identity of the species occupying a particular trophic position is crucial to predicting the impact of that trophic position on a community. Ecologists should not simply assume that species are functionally similar. The differing effects of different predators suggest that variation in their distribution across complex landscapes influences prey number biomass population dynamics distribution and ultimately local and regional species diversity. 686:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological network patterns are influenced by diverse processes that operate at different temporal rates. Here we analyzed whether the coupled effect of local abundance variation seasonally phenotypic plastic responses and species evolutionary adaptations might act in concert to shape network patterns. We studied the temporal variation in three interaction properties of bird species (number of interactions per species interaction strength and interaction asymmetry) in a temporal sequence of 28 plant frugivore interaction networks spanning two years in a Mediterranean shrubland community. Three main hypotheses dealing with the temporal variation of network properties were tested examining the effects of abundance switching behavior between alternative food resources and morphological traits in determining consumer interaction patterns. Our results demonstrate that temporal variation in consumer interaction patterns is explained by short term variation in resource and bird abundances and seasonal dietary switches between alternative resources (fleshy fruits and insects). Moreover differences in beak morphology are associated with differences in switching behavior between resources suggesting an important role of foraging adaptations in determining network patterns. We argue that beak shape adaptations might determine generalist and specialist feeding behaviors and thus the positions of consumer species within the network. Finally we provide a preliminary framework to interpret phylogenetic signal in plant animal networks. Indeed we show that the strength of the phylogenetic signal in networks depends on the relative importance of abundance behavioral and morphological variables. We show that these variables strongly differ in their phylogenetic signal. Consequently we suggest that moderate and significant phylogenetic effects should be commonly observed in networks of species interactions. 687:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological surprises substantial and unanticipated changes in the abundance of one or more species that result from previously unsuspected processes are a common outcome of both experiments and observations in community and population ecology. Here we give examples of such surprises along with the results of a survey of well established field ecologists most of whom have encountered one or more surprises over the course of their careers. Truly surprising results are common enough to require their consideration in any reasonable effort to characterize nature and manage natural resources. We classify surprises as dynamic pattern or intervention based and we speculate on the common processes that cause ecological systems to so often surprise us. A long standing and still growing concern in the ecological literature is how best to make predictions of future population and community dynamics. Although most work on this subject involves statistical aspects of data analysis and modeling the frequency and nature of ecological surprises imply that uncertainty cannot be easily tamed through improved analytical procedures and that prudent management of both exploited and conserved communities will require precautionary and adaptive management approaches. 694:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Eutrophication and predator additions and extinctions are occurring in ecosystems worldwide. Although theory predicts that both will strongly alter the distribution of biomass in whole communities empirical evidence has not been consolidated to quantitatively determine whether these theoretical predictions are generally borne out in real ecosystems. Here we analyze data from two types of trophic cascade studies predator removals in factorial combination with fertilization and observed productivity gradients to assess the role of top down and bottom up forces in structuring multi trophic communities and compare results from these analyses to those from an extensive database of trophic cascade studies. We find that herbivore biomass declines and plant biomass increases in the presence of predators regardless of system productivity. In contrast while plants are increased by fertilization this effect does not significantly increase herbivores in either the presence or absence of predators. These patterns are consistent among marine freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems and are largely independent of study size and duration. Thus top down effects of predation are transferred through more trophic levels than are bottom up effects of eutrophication showing strong asymmetry in the direction of control of biomass distribution in communities. 69:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many ecologists believe that higher mortality imposed on competing species increases the probability that they will coexist. This belief has persisted in spite of many theoretical counterarguments. However few of those counterarguments have been based on models having explicit representation of the resources for which competition is occurring. This article analyzes a series of consumer resource models of competition for nutritionally substitutable renewable resources and determines the range of relative resource requirements that allow coexistence. In most cases if consumers are initially efficient at reducing resource densities increasing density independent mortality widens the range of resource requirements of the consumers that allow coexistence provided the increase in mortality is not too great. The coexistence promoting effects of mortality occur because a very efficient consumer species usually reduces the diversity of the set of resources it consumes. This lessens the extent to which resource utilization differences between consumer species can be expressed. Mortality in this case increases the diversity of resource types widening the conditions for coexistence. However sufficiently high mortality will usually reduce the range of parameters allowing coexistence in agreement with much previous theory. The results presented here also predict maximal diversity at intermediate levels of productivity. Previous empirical studies and theory are reviewed in light of the theory developed here. 701:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Growth is a critical ecological trait because it can determine population demography evolution and community interactions. Predation risk frequently induces decreased foraging and slow growth in prey. However such strategies may not always be favored when prey can outgrow a predators hunting ability. At the same time a growing gape limited predator broadens its hunting ability through time by expanding its gape and thereby creates a moving size refuge for susceptible prey. Here I explore the rami. cations of growing gape limited predators for adaptive prey growth. A discrete demographic model for optimal foraging growth strategies was derived under the realistic scenario of gape limited and gape unconstrained predation threats. Analytic and numerical results demonstrate a novel fitness minimum just above the growth rate of the gape limited predator. This local fitness minimum separates a slow growth strategy that forages infrequently and accumulates low but constant predation risk from a fast growth strategy that forages frequently and experiences a high early predation risk in return for lower future predation risk and enhanced fecundity. Slow strategies generally were advantageous in communities dominated by gape unconstrained predators whereas fast strategies were advantageous in gape limited predator communities. Results were sensitive to the assumed relationships between prey size and fecundity and between prey growth and predation risk. Predator growth increased the parameter space favoring fast prey strategies. The model makes the testable predictions that prey should not grow at the same rate as their gape limited predator and generally should grow faster than the fastest growing gape limited predator. By focusing on predator constraints on prey capture these results integrate the ecological and evolutionary implications of prey growth in diverse predator communities and offer an explanation for empirical growth patterns previously viewed to be anomalies. 706:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In several taxa the ability to feed omnivorously from more than one trophic level has evolved from more specialized feeding habits. A prerequisite for this evolutionary scenario is initial coexistence (on the same or different trophic levels) of the consumers subsequently involved in omnivory. Evolution of omnivory should also be favored by prior asymmetries in consumer interactions. I use a dynamic model to explore conditions for coexistence of two consumers depending on a single biotic resource in simple. food webs of increasing asymmetry between consumers: (1) pure resource competition (2) resource competition with unidirectional interference (3) omnivory and (4) pure predation. If consumers are energy limited omnivory is unlikely to evolve from a competitive system because stable coexistence of two consumers on a single resource is impossible even if there is a trade off between resource exploitation and interference abilities. Initial coexistence of two consumers is easier to achieve if the species are arranged in a food chain. If costs of diet generalization are low selection should then favor the inclusion of the resource in the top consumers diet. In systems with high resource carrying capacity the intermediate consumer will then however be frequently driven to extinction in which case omnivory is not maintained. Low nutritional quality of the resource can stabilize the omnivory system and allow three species coexistence at high resource carrying capacities. Low nutritional quality of the resource may also create conditions for the evolution of omnivory from a competitive system. If the content of an essential nutrient in resource biomass is dynamic stable coexistence of two competitors becomes possible if both are limited by the nutrient content of the resource. In this case selection may favor the evolution of omnivory because competitor biomass is usually of higher nutritional quality than resource biomass. An explicit treatment of flexible resource stoichiometry thus broadens the possibilities for the evolution of omnivory. 707:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this paper we review the empirical studies documenting trait mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) in food webs. Basic models and empirical approaches that form the foundation of our conceptualization of species interactions generally assume that interactions are an intrinsic property of the two interacting species and therefore are governed by their respective densities. However if a species reacts to the presence of a second species by altering its phenotype then the trait changes in the reacting species can alter the per capita effect of the reacting species on other species and consequently population density or fitness of the other species. Such trait mediated indirect interactions can reinforce or oppose density mediated effects and have been largely overlooked by community ecologists. We first briefly develop the case for the broad mechanistic basis for TMIIs and then review the direct evidence for TMIIs in various permutations of simple three to four species food webs. We find strong evidence for quantitatively significant effects of TMIIs in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial systems. We further highlight those few studies that address the question of the relative magnitudes of density and trait mediated effects and the role of species densities in their transmission. These studies indicate that trait effects are often as strong or stronger than density effects. We conclude that ecological communities are replete with TMIIs arising from trait plasticity and that these effects are quantitatively important to community dynamics. Finally we synthesize our results and indicate profitable directions for future research. 708:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Indirect effects in which one species affects another through an intermediate species can occur by changes in either the density or the traits of the intermediate species. Ecologists have focused primarily on density mediated indirect effects but have become interested in quantifying the relative sizes of trait and density mediated indirect effects. We examined how state dependent prey behavior and experimental protocols affect the sizes of measured trait and density mediated indirect effects in a three species chain (predator prey and resource). We found that the size of trait mediated indirect effects relative to the size of density mediated indirect effects increases as the level of resources increases. We also found that the relative contributions of trait and density mediated indirect effects depend on the timing of manipulations in relation to the state of individuals and their vulnerability to predators. In addition we found that trait mediated indirect effects that have been measured during a portion of a season may diminish or disappear when measured across a whole season because of behavioral compensation. These results show that the relative contributions of trait and density mediated indirect effects in a system will be variable and experiments need to be designed to account for dynamic systems. 711:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is well established that species richness of primary producers and primary consumers can enhance efficiency of resource uptake and biomass production of respective trophic levels. At the level of secondary consumers (predators) however conclusions about the functional role of biodiversity have been mixed. We take advantage of a recent surge of published experiments (totaling 46 since 2005) to both evaluate general effects of predator richness on aggregate prey suppression (top down control) and explore sources of variability among experiments. Our results show that across experiments predator richness enhances prey suppression relative to the average single predator species (mean richness effect) but not the best performing species. Mean richness effects in predator experiments were stronger than those for primary producers and detritivores suggesting that relationships between richness and function may increase with trophic height in food webs. The strength of mean predator richness effects increased with the spatial and temporal scale of experiments and the taxonomic distinctness (TD used as a proxy of phylogenetic diversity) of species present. This latter result suggests that TD captures important aspects of functional differentiation among predators and that measures of biodiversity that go beyond species richness may help to better predict the effects of predator species loss. 715:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many animal species are unevenly distributed across the landscape in spatial patterns that continually shift over time. Such a shifting mosaic is thought to have profound implications for the persistence and stability of ecosystems. Management and conservation of natural systems would be enhanced if we could accurately predict movement. Such prediction has not yet been possible. Here we use an extensive set of field data on food abundance and quality combined with experimentally derived measures of nutritional value to predict the spatial distribution of Thomsons gazelles (Gazella thomsoni thomsoni Gunter) on the Serengeti Plains of East Africa. Twelve plausible models based on alternate foraging objectives or movement rules were assessed against field data on food and grazer abundance gathered at biweekly intervals (every two weeks) over the course of the wet seasons in two different years. Nomadic movements of gazelles closely tracked changes in the spatial distribution of short grass swards. Gazelles left short grass patches when local daily energy intake dropped below the expected intake averaged across the landscape. Subsequent redistribution of gazelles among neighboring patches was proportional to daily rates of energy intake in each patch. Thus nomadic movements by Thomsons gazelles were predictable on the basis of local energy gain. This suggests that adaptive behavioral models can provide useful predictive tools for understanding the dynamics of complex natural systems. 719:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most natural plant populations are attacked by a suite of enemy species but there are differing views on how commonly individuals within populations must confront multiple enemies. I evaluated during 10 years the number of insect and pathogen taxa attacking leaves and flowers on tagged individuals of Lomatium dissectum (Apiaceae) a long lived herbaceous perennial. In addition I determined the minimum number of established plants killed by pocket gophers. At least 43 PeRcEnT of the deaths were attributable directly to feeding on roots by gophers. On average 68 PeRcEnT of plants were attacked each year by at least one insect or pathogen species and plants harbored each year a mean of 1.6 insect pathogen species. By year 10 all surviving plants had been attacked by at least two enemies. Yearly attack by a small number of enemy species is a pervasive part of the life history of individual plants within this population. 723:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Omnivory is a frequent feeding strategy in terrestrial arthropods occurring across a diversity of taxa occupying a wide array of habitats. Because omnivory has important consequences for broad areas of theoretical and applied ecology it is essential to understand those factors that favor its occurrence. Here we address the limiting role of nitrogen in promoting omnivory not so much from the historical perspective of herbivores supplementing their nutrient poor plant diet but by extending the argument to higher trophic levels where predators feed on each other as well as herbivores. Drawing on the historically documented mismatch in nitrogen stoichiometry between herbivores and their host plants (C:N(plants)much greater than C:N herbivores) and a recently documented though smaller difference in nitrogen content between predators and their herbivore prey (C:N herbivores   C:N predators) we discuss the existence of a trade off between nutrient quality and quantity that occurs across trophic levels. The existence of this trade off suggests that arthropod predators which we show to be frequently nitrogen limited in nature can enhance their nitrogen intake by broadening their diet to include nitrogen rich predators. We conclude by outlining the consequences of this trade off for the relative balance between dietary specialization and supplementation among consumers emphasizing the divergent roles that large vs. small stoichiometric mismatches may have had for the evolution of omnivory. 730:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plant community structure is often the result of interactions between succession disturbance and dispersal. While some disturbances may be highly stochastic  flooding or landslides) other types of disturbance are closely linked to the current successional state of the community  fire or herbivory). For example when herbivores preferentially feed on early successional species they may generate conditions favorable for these species and thus create a positive feedback. Positive feedbacks may create multiple stable equilibria within plant communities. We demonstrate the presence of these positive feedbacks using experiments conducted in a restored California grassland. We found that pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) preferentially forage in areas dominated by annual species and gopher foraging activity increases the abundance of annual plants. We use a Markov chain model to identify how the foraging behavior dispersal behavior and population dynamics of territorial herbivores can structure a plant community across multiple spatial scales. The model is loosely based on the biology of pocket gophers though it is general enough to be applicable to other territorial herbivores with foraging preferences. We find that a foraging preference for early successional species can generate multiple plant communities that persist within a herbivores territory. If juveniles are selective when searching for territories during their dispersal phase then herbivores can also generate persistent and distinct plant communities over larger spatial scales. In this case fixed regions of the landscape. may become occupied by herbivores for long periods (many herbivore generations) and be composed of a range of successional plant species whereas the remaining landscape is abandoned by herbivores and becomes dominated by late successional species. This structuring of the landscape occurs even though we assume that the entire landscape is intrinsically identical. 732:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plants engage in multiple simultaneous interactions with other species; some ( enemies) reduce and others (mutualists) enhance plant performance. Moreover effects of different species may not be independent of one another; for example enemies may compete reducing their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and negative effects as well as the frequency of interactive effects and whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance have never been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant enemy and plant mutualist interactions. We performed a meta analysis of experiments in which two enemies two mutualists or an enemy and a mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically we performed a factorial meta analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the magnitude of ( negative) enemy effects was greater than that of ( positive) mutualist effects in isolation but in the presence of other species the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies evaluating single species effects of mutualists may underestimate the true effects found in natural settings where multiple interactions are the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies nor did mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However these averages mask significant and large but positive or negative interactions in individual studies. In contrast mutualists ameliorated the negative effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground mutualists ( bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the greenhouse ( but not the field) pathogens reduced plant performance more than did herbivores pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous than to woody plants and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to non crop plants ( suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores following crop domestication). We discuss how observed differences in effect size might be confounded with methodological differences among studies. 738:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predator effects on prey dynamics are conventionally studied by measuring changes in prey abundance attributed to consumption by predators. We revisit four classic examples of predator prey systems often cited in textbooks and incorporate subsequent studies of nonconsumptive effects of predators (NCE) defined as changes in prey traits (e. g. behavior growth development) measured on an ecological time scale. Our review revealed that NCE were integral to explaining lynx hare population dynamics in boreal forests cascading effects of top predators in Wisconsin lakes and cascading effects of killer whales and sea otters on kelp forests in nearshore marine habitats. The relative roles of consumption and NCE of wolves on moose and consequent indirect effects on plant communities of Isle Royale depended on climate oscillations. Nonconsumptive effects have not been explicitly tested to explain the link between planktonic alewives and the size structure of the zooplankton nor have they been invoked to attribute keystone predator status in intertidal communities or elsewhere. We argue that both consumption and intimidation contribute to the total effects of keystone predators and that characteristics of keystone consumers may differ from those of predators having predominantly NCE. Nonconsumptive effects are often considered as an afterthought to explain observations inconsistent with consumption based theory. Consequently NCE with the same sign as consumptive effects may be overlooked even though they can affect the magnitude rate or scale of a prey response to predation and can have important management or conservation implications. Nonconsumptive effects may underlie other classic paradigms in ecology such as delayed density dependence and predator mediated prey coexistence. Revisiting classic studies enriches our understanding of predator prey dynamics and provides compelling rationale for ramping up efforts to consider how NCE affect traditional predator prey models based on consumption and to compare the relative magnitude of consumptive and NCE of predators. 739:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predators can affect prey populations through changes in traits that reduce predation risk. These trait changes (nonconsumptive effects NCEs) can be energetically costly and cause reduced prey activity growth fecundity and survival. The strength of nonconsumptive effects may vary with two functional characteristics of predators: hunting mode (actively hunting sit and pursue sit and wait) and habitat domain (the ability to pursue prey via relocation in space; can be narrow or broad). Specifically cues from fairly stationary sit and wait and sit and pursue predators should be more indicative of imminent predation risk and thereby evoke stronger NCEs compared to cues from widely ranging actively hunting predators. Using a meta analysis of 193 published papers we found that cues from sit and pursue predators evoked stronger NCEs than cues from actively hunting predators. Predator habitat domain was less indicative of NCE strength perhaps because habitat domain provides less reliable information regarding imminent risk to prey than does predator hunting mode. Given the importance of NCEs in determining the dynamics of prey communities our findings suggest that predator characteristics may be used to predict how changing predator communities translate into changes in prey. Such knowledge may prove particularly useful given rates of local predator change due to habitat fragmentation and the introduction of novel predators. 746:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Resource subsidies from external habitats can enhance the performance or population density of local consumers altering their effects on in situ prey. Indirect effects of subsidies may be either positive or negative depending on the behavior of the shared consumer. Here we document strong links between riverine insects riparian lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) and terrestrial invertebrates. We hypothesized that aquatic insects subsidize riparian lizard populations leading to higher growth rates of these lizards in near river habitats and that subsidies exert short term positive effects on terrestrial resources as a result of diet shifts by lizards to aquatic insects. To test these hypotheses we used 2 m high fences or   subsidy shields    to experimentally reduce aquatic insect flux to large (91 m 2) enclosures of lizards. Subsidy shields reduced aquatic insect flux by 55 65 PeRcEnT. Growth rates of lizards were 7X higher in subsidized (no shield) enclosures during the early summer but were not significantly different later in the summer when ambient fluxes of aquatic insects dropped to 20 PeRcEnT of their early season levels. Within the watershed lizard growth rates (in mass) were positively correlated with the numerical abundance of aquatic insects. Thus lizard growth rates tracked both seasonal and spatial availability of riverine insect subsidies during our experiment. Subsidies also had indirect effects on the ground dwelling terrestrial prey of lizards. Declines of diurnal terrestrial invertebrates Were significantly higher in shield than no shield enclosures and the most common ground spider (Arctosa sp. Lycosidae ) disappeared completely from shield enclosures by the end of the experiment. Declines in terrestrial invertebrate abundance did not differ between no shield enclosures and lizard exclosures. These data suggest that riverine insects subsidize riparian Sceloporus and in the short term reduce their predation on terrestrial arthropods. 749:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial subsidies or inputs of resources from more productive donor habitats can cause numerical responses in consumer populations via behavioral and demographic mechanisms. In addition subsidies may have indirect effects on the in situ prey of these consumers. These indirect effects can be either negative  apparent competition) or positive  via diet shifts) depending on the relative strength of the predators functional and numerical responses to prey subsidies. Here we report a numerical response by a lizard (Western fence lizard Sceloporus occidentalis) to experimental reductions in the flux of river derived insects. Initially equal densities of lizards declined significantly faster in plots in which aquatic insect abundance was reduced by nearly 50 PeRcEnT (season average) relative to controls. Abundance and biomass of terrestrial arthropods declined significantly between the start and end of the experiment across treatments. Despite consistently lower lizard abundance in plots with reduced subsidy levels however relative declines in the abundance and biomass of in situ terrestrial arthropods (all taxa combined) were not significantly different between reduced and ambient subsidy plots. Relative declines in spider biomass differed significantly between treatments and were higher in reduced subsidy than ambient subsidy plots but only over one of three 3 wk sampling intervals. Thus over the biologically active summer season aquatic subsidies exerted brief positive or no significant indirect effects on the in situ prey of riparian lizards. These results suggest that although aquatic insect prey may determine the spatial distribution and local abundance of riparian predators the effects of increased predator density on in situ prey may be offset by higher per capita predation by these consumers on in situ prey in subsidy poor relative to subsidy rich habitats. 76:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Much of the work on species coexistence has focused on the presence or absence of single mechanisms. Most theoretical frameworks however do not allow one to measure the strength of coexistence mechanisms and so it has been difficult to determine the relative importance of each mechanism when multiple mechanisms are present. We present a model inspired by the California red scale system in which two parasitoids coexist on a single tree dwelling host scale insect. Previous work suggests that coexistence may be promoted both by intraguild predation ( IGP) and by differing preferences for hosts on stems versus hosts on leaves ( habitat preference). By applying an analytic framework that quantifies the strengths of spatial coexistence mechanisms we are able to measure the individual contributions of IGP habitat preference and their interaction to maintaining coexistence. We find that habitat preference is much more effective at promoting coexistence in this model than in IGP. Furthermore the effects of habitat preference and IGP are not independent. When the two parasitoids prefer different habitats the coexistence promoting effects of habitat preference are strengthened by IGP if IGP gives a moderate advantage to the inferior competitor. If IGP either confers an excessive advantage or favors the superior competitor it can diminish the coexistence region. 775:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article analyzes the limitations of the most widely used method for quantifying the impact of dynamic antipredator traits on food chain dynamics and discusses alternative approaches. The standard method for a predator prey resource chain estimates the effects of the preys defensive behavior by comparing population densities or fitness measures in a predator cue treatment to those in a no predator treatment. This design has been interpreted as providing a measure of the nonconsumptive effect of the predator on the prey and the trait mediated indirect effect of the predator on the resource. Other approaches involve measurements of the impact of the behavior in the presence of functional predators. The questions addressed here are: (1) How consistent are the results of different approaches? (2) How time dependent are their results? (3) How well do they correspond to theoretical measures of effect size? (4) How useful are the measurements in understanding system dynamics? A model of a tritrophic system in which the prey species adjusts a defensive trait adaptively is used to evaluate the experimental designs. Measures of changes in prey fitness or population density in a cue treatment generally include offsetting effects of the cost of the behavior and the benefit of more resources. This means that the sign of the effect as well as its magnitude may change depending on when the experiment is terminated. Because predation is not present in the cue treatment few conclusions can be drawn about the impact of the behavior on population densities or fitness of the prey in a natural setting with predators. Cue experiments often do not accurately separate trait mediated from density mediated effects on the resource. Most scalar measures of effects are sensitive to experimental duration and initial densities. Use of a wider range of experimental designs to measure trait related effects is called for. 776:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article asks under what conditions and to what extent periodic variation in the growth rate of a single shared limiting resource facilitates the coexistence of two competing consumers that differ in having linear vs. nonlinear responses to that resource. The analysis explores the effects of four factors on the range of consumer characteristics that allow coexistence: (1) whether resource growth is biotic or abiotic; (2) the efficiency of the consumers in reducing the resource population; (3) the rapidity of the demographic response of the consumers to changes in resource density; and (4) the period and amplitude of the periodicity in resource growth. Coexistence of two competitors differing greatly in the linearity of their responses is most likely when (1) resource growth is biotic and (2) the consumers are relatively inefficient. The effects on coexistence of the third and fourth factors can be more complicated particularly when the resource is biotic. However in most cases coexistence occurs over a wider range of conditions when the linear consumer has a more rapid numerical response than the nonlinear consumer and when the period of environmental fluctuation is much longer than the minimum doubling time of the consumer populations. If the resource is biotic consumer resource cycles can be produced by the nonlinear consumer and environmental cycles may either interfere with or reinforce these contracting or expanding the conditions allowing coexistence. However the interaction of endogenous cycles and periodic variation in resource growth generally has highly nonadditive effects on coexistence. These findings help explain why few previous experimental studies have demonstrated coexistence due to the relative nonlinearity of consumer responses. 777:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To capture their prey larval antlions invest energy in building and maintaining conical pit traps in fine particulate substrate. The resident antlions (Myrmeleon immaculatus) at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Michigan USA seldom relocated their pits and we wondered whether this site fidelity could be understood as an optimal (or near optimal) response to observed spatial and temporal variation in prey availability. To determine this we considered a large number of compound foraging strategies each composed of the number of days over which the antlion evaluates foraging success at a site; the weighted average foraging success during this interval below which threshold the antlion moves to a new site; and the length of the random walk taken by the antlion to a new pit location. Using Monte Carlo simulation we determined the expected net energy gain from each of these strategies by antlions rewarded according to the field data set. The overall highest gain strategy generally agreed with our a priori expectations for the observed pattern of patchiness in prey availability over space and time. Moreover the corresponding optimal frequency of pit relocation 1.65 moves over the observation period of similar to 8 wk is in rough agreement with field observations. However the gain surface was relatively flat: 60 PeRcEnT of the investigated strategies yielded within 8 PeRcEnT of the maximum gain. When costs of pit relocation were reduced maximal gain strategies shifted to generate frequent movement suggesting that the magnitude of such sampling costs may control the foraging strategy in environments with high spatiotemporal variability. 780:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Trait and density mediated indirect effects describe different pathways by which indirect interactions in food webs are propagated from one species to another through changes in intermediate species. A series of articles in Ecology has progressively altered the original definitions of   trait mediated to the point where understanding is being impeded. The most recent of these articles are two meta analyses that use   trait mediated to describe the demographic costs to a prey species of employing anti predator defenses. These same articles introduce a companion term   density mediated interaction apparently to describe direct and indirect interactions that only involve changes in population density due to consumption by predators. This new terminology has many disadvantages including ( 1) using a general term for a relatively narrow group of processes; ( 2) using   mediated in a manner inconsistent with existing terminology; ( 3) confusing the accepted definitions of different types of indirect effects; and ( 4) providing a highly incomplete measure of the impact of behavior on the predator prey interaction. Solutions to these problems and the meaning of the meta analyses are discussed. 781:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Trait mediated interactions (TMIs) in which trophic and competitive interactions depend on individual traits as well as on overall population densities have inspired large amounts of research but theoretical and empirical studies have not been well connected. To help mitigate this problem we review and synthesize the theoretical literature on TMIs and in particular on trait mediated indirect interactions TMIIs in which the presence of one species mediates the interaction between a second and third species. (1) In models TMIs tend to stabilize simple communities; adding further biological detail often reduces stability in models but populations may persist even if their dynamics become mathematically unstable. (2) Short and long term changes in population density caused by TMIs depend even more on details such as the curvature of functional responses and trade offs which have rarely been measured. (3) The effects of TMIs in multipredator communities depend in a straightforward way on the specificity of prey defenses. (4) Tritrophic and more complex communities are theoretically difficult; few general conclusions have emerged. Theory needs new kinds of experiments as a guide. The most critical needs are experiments that measure curvatures of trade offs and responses and experiments that (combined with theory) allow us to scale from short to long term responses of communities. Anecdotal evidence from long term and large scale studies suggests that TMIs may affect community dynamics at practical management scales; community models incorporating TMIs are necessary and require closer collaborations between theory and experiment. 782:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Trophic cascades have been documented in a diversity of ecological systems and can be important in determining biomass distribution within a community. To date the literature on trophic cascades has focused on whether and in which systems cascades occur. Many biological  productivity : biomass ratios) and methodological  experiment size or duration) factors vary with the ecosystem in which data were collected but ecosystem type per se does not provide mechanistic insights into factors controlling cascade strength. Here we tested various hypotheses about why trophic cascades occur and what determines their magnitude using data from 114 studies that measured the indirect trophic effects of predators on plant community biomass in seven aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta analysis we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found in contrast to predictions that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31 PeRcEnT of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems 18 PeRcEnT of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems. Thus although cascade strength can be described by biological characteristics of predators and herbivores future research on indirect trophic effects must further examine biological and methodological differences among studies and systems. 788:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We compiled life tables for 78 holometabolous herbivorous insect species to quantify levels of apparent enemy induced mortality of immature insects. Enemies were classified by type (predator parasitoid or pathogen) and mortalities caused by each type in each herbivore immature stage were tested with Analysis of Deviance for differences associated with four ecological characteristics of preadult herbivores: feeding biology invasion status and the cultivation status and latitudinal zone of the habitat. Total enemy induced mortality is higher in the late developmental stages and overall parasitoids kill more herbivores than do either predators or pathogens. Among the ecological variables both feeding biology and latitude showed significant enemy effects in at least one late developmental stage whereas neither cultivation status nor invasion status was associated with enemy induced mortality in any stage. Bonferroni adjustment of probabilities for multiple comparisons resulted in few significant interactions between enemy type and the ecological variables. However raw probabilities and comparisons across herbivore immature stages suggest several patterns that deserve attention in future studies: (1)endophytic herbivores suffer lower mortality by predators and pathogens than exophytics and endophytic leaf miners suffer the greatest parasitoid induced mortality while endophytic gallers borers root feeders suffer the least; (2) overall enemy induced mortality is similar in natural and cultivated habitats; (3) exotic insects do not suffer lower enemy induced mortality rates than natives; and (4) predation and disease may be greater in tropical subtropical habitats whereas parasitism is greater in the temperate zone. These results identify several general patterns in insect demographics that should be useful for hypothesis testing. 792:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examine how spatial subdivision of predator prey systems affects colonization processes in metapopulations. Dynamics of the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae (prey) and the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis are highly unstable on isolated bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) and ultimately result in extinction of prey and predators. Assembling a collection of 90 plants without any dispersal barriers (a super island experiment) does not modify the persistence of the predator prey system. Subdividing the system into a metapopulation with barriers for dispersal (a collection of eight islands with 10 plants per island) leads to persistence of the predator prey dynamics for many generations. In this paper we use the time series of colonization events and prey and predator densities from the super island and metapopulation experiments to understand how colonization processes of prey and predatory mites are altered by spatial subdivision. Using survival analysis we estimate how prey and predator colonization probability is affected by densities of the colonist pool at different distances from the target plant. Contrasting the results from the super island and metapopulation experiments reveals that spatial subdivision affects the discovery rate of prey outbreaks by predatory mites and differentially affects colonization by prey and predators. Prey colonization is primarily determined by local densities of prey in spatially subdivided systems whereas predator colonization retains primarily   global   influences. Our analysis of colonization processes suggests mechanisms accounting for stability in the metapopulation experiments and provides the quantitative basis for the development of colonization functions to explore these mechanisms in predator prey models of acarine systems. 793:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We explore two aspects of how predation within the rhizosphere influences nutrient availability plant productivity and aboveground community dynamics. First plant roots and soil microbes have a long history of interaction that is centered on the reciprocal acquisition of carbon by microbes and nitrogen by plants. Predators within the rhizosphere alter these interactions in ways that benefit plants but also influence the dynamics of other species within ecosystems and processes that are important to ecosystem function and stability. These same predators regulate their prey in a traditional   top down   manner but in doing so alter the release of nutrients that may limit plant productivity and thereby affect plant growth in a   bottom up   fashion as well. Second much attention has been given to the importance of specific interactions or as presented within this series genes and or gene products as critical control points. We suggest that control should be viewed within the framework of interactivity. The interdependence between the aboveground and belowground realms can be explained in terms of the patterning of trophic interactions within the rhizosphere and the influence of these interactions on the supply of nutrients and rates of nutrient uptake by plants. While specific interactions may be important it is the patterning of these interactions into assemblages of species that share similar growth rates and habitats that is the salient feature of the rhizosphere that confers stability affects nutrient retention and regulates aboveground and belowground dynamics. 807:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We review four case studies in which there is a risk of extinction or severe reduction in highly valued species if we ignore either or both of two ecosystem control options.   Symptomatic control   implies direct control of extinction risk through direct harvesting or culling of competitors and predators.   Systemic control   implies treating the causes of the problem that led to an unnaturally high abundance in the first place. We demonstrate with a discussion of historically observed population trends how surprising trophic interactions can emerge as a result of alterations to a system. Simulation models were developed for two of the case studies as aids to adaptive policy design to expose possible abundance changes caused by trophic interactions and to highlight key uncertainties about possible responses to ecosystem management policies involving active intervention to control abundances. With reasonable parameter values these models predict a wide range of possible responses given available data but do indicate a good chance that active control would reverse declines and reverse extinction risks. We find that controlling seal (Phoca vitulina) populations in the Georgia Strait increases juvenile survival rates of commercial salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) species but that commensurate increases in hake populations from decreased seal predation could be a compensatory source of predation on juvenile salmon. We also show that wolf (Canis lupus) control and moose (Alces alces) harvest bring about a recovery in caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations where simple habitat protection policies fail to recover caribou before wolf predation causes severe declines. The results help address a common problem in disturbed ecosystems where controlling extinction risks can mean choosing between active control of species abundance or establishing policies of protection and allowing threatened species to recover naturally. 818:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although trophic cascades (indirect effects of predators on plants via herbivores) occur in a wide variety of food webs the magnitudes of their effects are often quite variable. We compared the responses of herbivore and plant communities to predator manipulations in 102 field experiments in six different ecosystems: lentic ( lake and pond) marine and stream benthos lentic and marine plankton and terrestrial (grasslands and agricultural fields). Predator effects varied considerably among systems and were strongest in lentic and marine benthos and weakest in marine plankton and terrestrial food webs. Predator effects on herbivores were generally larger and more variable than on plants suggesting that cascades often become attenuated at the plant herbivore interface. Top down control of plant biomass was stronger in water than on land; however the differences among the five aquatic food webs were as great as those between wet and dry systems. 819:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, At the intersection of consumer behaviour and plant competition is the concept of refuge mediated apparent competition: an indirect interaction whereby plants provide a refuge for a shared consumer subsequently increasing consumer pressure on another plant species. Here we use a simple model and empirical examples to develop and illustrate the concept of refuge mediated apparent competition. We find that the likelihood that an inferior competitor will succeed via refuge mediated apparent competition is greater when competitors have similar resource requirements and when consumers exhibit a strong response to the refuge and high attack rates on the superior competitor. Refuge mediated apparent competition may create an emergent Allee effect such that a species invades only if it is sufficiently abundant to alter consumer impact on resident species. This indirect interaction may help explain unresolved patterns observed in biological invasion such as the different physical structure of invasive exotic plants the lag phase and the failure of restoration efforts. Given the ubiquity of refuge seeking behaviour by consumers and the ability of consumers to alter the outcome of direct competition among plants refuge mediated apparent competition may be an underappreciated mechanism affecting the composition and diversity of plant communities.

We suggest a novel mechanism in systems in which mutualists of plants are present and important predators can have indirect negative effects on producers through their consumption of mutualists. The strength of predator effects on producers will depend on their relative consumption of mutualists and antagonists and on the relative importance of each to producer population dynamics. In a meta analysis of experiments that examine the effects of predator reduction on the pollination and reproductive success of plants we found that the indirect negative effects of predators on plants are quite strong. Most predator removal experiments measure the strength of predator effects on producers through the antagonist pathway; we suggest that a more complete understanding of the role of predators will be achieved by simultaneously considering the effects of predators on plant mutualists.

Behavioural scale measurements on a guild of five species of freshwater pond snails (Mollusca: Pulmonata) indicate a trade off between the ability to utilize a patchs resource and the ability to quickly find new resource patches. Community level experiments demonstrate that both species richness and composition are affected by the patchiness of the environment. In particular treatments with low patchiness are dominated by species best at exploiting local resources (diggers) whereas treatments with high patchiness are dominated by species best at finding new patches (grazers). Results from a controlled mesocosm experiment with two of the most common of these species Helisoma trivolvis (a relative digger) and Physella gyrina (Physidae) (a relative grazer) show that the patchiness of the environment strongly influences the outcomes of interspecific competition among these two species: the digger performed much better in less patchy habitats whereas the grazer performed better in more patchy habitats. A two species model of diggers and grazers modified to incorporate behavioural aspects of patchiness produces this same pattern of competitive outcomes. 841:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Herbivores may grow with nutrient or energy limitation depending on food abundance and the chemical composition of their food. We present a model that describes herbivore growth as a continuous function of two limiting factors. This function uses the synthesizing unit concept has the hyperbolic Monod model as a limiting case and has the same number of parameters as the Monod model coupled to Liebigs discontinuous minimum rule. We use the model to explore nutrient limited herbivore growth in a closed system with algae Daphnia and phosphorus as the limiting nutrient. Phosphorus in algae. may substantially influence Daphnia growth. This influence changes over time and is most pronounced when algae and Daphnia populations fluctuate strongly. Relative to classic models that only consider food quantity as a determinant of Daphnia growth our model shows richer dynamical behaviour. In addition to the standard positive equilibrium which may be stable or unstable depending on nutrient availability a new positive equilibrium may arise in our model when mortality rates are relatively high. This equilibrium is unstable and reduces the likelihood of long term persistence of Daphnia in the system. 842:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Humans are rapidly altering the diversity and composition of ecological communities by accelerating rates of species extinctions and introductions. These changes in diversity are not random and disproportionately involve the addition or extinction of predators. Theoretical and microcosm studies suggest predator removal may either increase or decrease ecosystem stability. Here we test whether the addition or removal of predators affects aggregate biomass stability in 40 experiments carried out in six different ecosystems. Predators did not alter the temporal variability of autotroph biomass but significantly destabilized herbivore biomass. The effects of predators on herbivore biomass stability varied significantly among ecosystems with benthic and pelagic lake systems showing the greatest shifts. Consequently the addition of predators to communities as occurs in many conservation efforts biological control programmes and species introductions may lead to more variable system dynamics. 84:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Prey often behaviorally respond to changes in the intensity of predation risk and these responses can often significantly shape community dynamics but flexible responses to changes in predation risk require that prey have accurate and timely estimates of predation risk. We present a model of how a preys environment should shape the cognitive rules they use to assess predation risk and present how these rules shape the effects predators have on prey and the preys resources. In the model prey can rely on a combination of a fixed estimate of predation risk and a flexible estimate of predation risk shaped by their recent experience. Prey relied more on their experience to estimate predation risk when predator cues were more reliable and when predator densities were lower. In addition when the prey cognitive rules favored a greater use of their experience to estimate predation risk the presence of predators caused larger nonconsumptive effects and generally smaller consumptive effects on prey and the preys resources. These differences in prey cognition also altered the effects that alterations of cue reliability and predator densities had on prey and their resources. 855:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nutrient availability and herbivory control the biomass of primary producer communities to varying degrees across ecosystems. Ecological theory individual experiments in many different systems and system specific quantitative reviews have suggested that (i) bottom up control is pervasive but top down control is more influential in aquatic habitats relative to terrestrial systems and (ii) bottom up and top down forces are interdependent with statistical interactions that synergize or dampen relative influences on producer biomass. We used simple dynamic models to review ecological mechanisms that generate independent vs. interactive responses of community level biomass. We calibrated these mechanistic predictions with the metrics of factorial meta analysis and tested their prevalence across freshwater marine and terrestrial ecosystems with a comprehensive meta analysis of 191 factorial manipulations of herbivores and nutrients. Our analysis showed that producer community biomass increased with fertilization across all systems although increases were greatest in freshwater habitats. Herbivore removal generally increased producer biomass in both freshwater and marine systems but effects were inconsistent on land. With the exception of marine temperate rocky reef systems that showed positive synergism of nutrient enrichment and herbivore removal experimental studies showed limited support for statistical interactions between nutrient and herbivory treatments on producer biomass. Top down control of herbivores compensatory behaviour of multiple herbivore guilds spatial and temporal heterogeneity of interactions and herbivore mediated nutrient recycling may lower the probability of consistent interactive effects on producer biomass. Continuing studies should expand the temporal and spatial scales of experiments particularly in understudied terrestrial systems; broaden factorial designs to manipulate independently multiple producer resources  nitrogen phosphorus light) multiple herbivore taxa or guilds  vertebrates and invertebrates) and multiple trophic levels; and in addition to measuring producer biomass assess the responses of species diversity community composition and nutrient status. 865:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Parasitism is the most common consumer strategy among organisms yet only recently has there been a call for the inclusion of infectious disease agents in food webs. The value of this effort hinges on whether parasites affect food web properties. Increasing evidence suggests that parasites have the potential to uniquely alter food web topology in terms of chain length connectance and robustness. In addition parasites might affect food web stability interaction strength and energy flow. Food web structure also affects infectious disease dynamics because parasites depend on the ecological networks in which they live. Empirically incorporating parasites into food webs is straightforward. We may start with existing food webs and add parasites as nodes or we may try to build food webs around systems for which we already have a good understanding of infectious processes. In the future perhaps researchers will add parasites while they construct food webs. Less clear is how food web theory can accommodate parasites. This is a deep and central problem in theoretical biology and applied mathematics. For instance is representing parasites with complex life cycles as a single node equivalent to representing other species with ontogenetic niche shifts as a single node? Can parasitism fit into fundamental frameworks such as the niche model? Can we integrate infectious disease models into the emerging field of dynamic food web modelling? Future progress will benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and infectious disease biologists. 868:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plant herbivore interactions mediate the trophic structure of ecosystems. We use a comprehensive data set extracted from the literature to test the relative explanatory power of two contrasting bodies of ecological theory the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and ecological stoichiometry (ES) for per capita and population level rates of herbivory across ecosystems. We found that ambient temperature and herbivore body size (MTE) as well as stoichiometric mismatch (ES) both constrained herbivory but at different scales of biological organization. Herbivore body size which varied over 11 orders of magnitude was the primary factor explaining variation in per capita rates of herbivory. Stoichiometric mismatch explained more variation in population level herbivory rates and also in per capita rates when we examined data from within functionally similar trophic groups  zooplankton). Thus predictions from metabolic and stoichiometric theories offer complementary explanations for patterns of herbivory that operate at different scales of biological organization. 871:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predator control programmes are generally implemented in an attempt to increase prey population sizes. However predator removal could prove harmful to prey populations that are regulated primarily by parasitic infections rather than by predation. We develop models for microparasitic and macroparasitic infection that specify the conditions where predator removal will (a) increase the incidence of parasitic infection (b) reduce the number of healthy individuals in the prey population and (c) decrease the overall size of the prey population. In general predator removal is more likely to be harmful when the parasite is highly virulent macroparasites are highly aggregated in their prey hosts are long lived and the predators select infected prey. 872:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predators influence prey populations both by consuming individual prey and by inducing changes in prey behaviour that limit reproduction and survival. Because prey trade off predation risk for forageing gains the magnitude of predators non consumptive effects should depend on resource availability. Studies of non consumptive effects generally adopt either of two strategies: (i) maintaining a static ration of the preys resources; and (ii) using resource populations that vary dynamically in response to prey behaviour. Contrasting these experimental designs using meta analysis we evaluated whether resource dynamics influence the magnitude of non consumptive effects on prey growth survival fecundity population density forageing rate and habitat use. Predators had a more negative effect on prey demography in dynamic vs. static resource experiments. Our results highlight the importance of resource dynamics in mediating the magnitude of non consumptive effects of predators on prey and illustrate the often unintended impacts of experimental design on estimates of effect size in ecological interactions. 885:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species persistence can be threatened by substantial temporal variation in food resources over time. On the other hand spatial heterogeneity in resources at the landscape scale might allow mobile consumers to compensate for temporal variability in resource availability at the local scale. We evaluated this hypothesis using an extensive data set on foraging grass growth and movement by Thomsons gazelles living on the Serengeti Plains. Here we show that modelled populations of Thomsons gazelles can only persist under Serengeti conditions in the face of observed levels of rainfall stochasticity by making adaptive movements to take advantage of ephemeral spatial distributions of food resources. More importantly our models suggest that Thomsons gazelles in Serengeti require unrestricted access to relatively large areas of grassland (  1600 km(2)) to guarantee long term persistence particularly when there is positive spatial autocorrelation in resource abundance as is the case in Serengeti. If this proves to be true for other species and or other systems then understanding of complex behavioural responses to spatially and temporally heterogeneous food supplies may be essential to successful conservation of grazing herbivores. 910:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This review discusses the interface between two of the most important types of interactions between species interspecific competition and predation. Predation has been claimed to increase decrease or have little effect on the strength impact or importance of interspecific competition. There is confusion about both the meaning these terms and the likelihood of and conditions required for each of these outcomes. In this article we distinguish among three measures of the influence of predation on competitive outcomes: short term per capita consumption or growth rates long term changes in density and the probability of competitive coexistence. We then outline various theoretical mechanisms that can lead to qualitatively distinct effects. of predators . The qualitative effect of predators can depend both on the mechanism of competition and on the definition of competitive strength impact. In assessing the empirical literature we ask: (1) What definitions of competitive strength impact have been assumed? (2) Does strong evidence exist to support one or more of the possible mechanisms that can produce a given outcome? (3) Do biases in the choice of organism or manipulation exist and are they likely to have influenced the conclusions reached? We conclude by discussing several unanswered questions and espouse a stronger interchange between empirical and theoretical approaches to this important question. 911:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Traditional approaches to the study of food webs emphasize the transfer of local primary productivity in the form of living plant organic matter across trophic levels. However dead organic matter or detritus a common feature of most ecosystems plays a frequently overlooked role as a dynamic heterogeneous resource and habitat for many species. We develop an integrative framework for understanding the impact of detritus that emphasizes the ontogeny and heterogeneity of detritus and the various ways that explicit inclusion of detrital dynamics alters generalizations about the structure and functioning of food webs. Through its influences on food web composition and dynamics detritus often increases system stability and persistence having substantial effects on trophic structure and biodiversity. Inclusion of detrital heterogeneity in models of food web dynamics is an essential new direction for ecological research. 917:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We evaluate whether species interaction frequency can be used as a surrogate for the total effect of a species on another. Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per interaction effect using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta analysis using data on I P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong positive relationship between T and I in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction regardless of their effectiveness on a per interaction basis. 925:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We studied foraging activity and food resource use of Brazilian free tailed bats Tadarida brasiliensis from a large maternity colony near Uvalde Texas. We recorded echolocation calls of bats at replicate sites in towns cropland and ranches and quantified the proportions of signal receiving time the numbers of feeding buzzes and the mean attack attempts per unit of activity time to evaluate habitat use by bats Food habits of the bats were determined from fecal samples and the composition and relative abundance of various insect orders in the three habitats were assessed using light traps. Towns with mercury vapor type street lamps appeared to be important feeding areas for the bats where they exhibited higher foraging activity and attack rates than over cropland or ranches. The common use of street lamps over towns however could have affected the efficiency of our traps in insect assessment towns exhibited lower relative insect abundance than the other two habitats. Insect abundance did not differ between ranches and cropland but a decline in relative insect abundance occurred in pre dawn periods over cropland which correlated to a higher bat activity per unit time over ranches than on cropland. The bats also displayed higher attack rates and had a broader diet in evening than in pre dawn periods The diet of bats contained 12 orders of insects which accounted for 80 PeRcEnT of insect orders captured in traps. At the ordinal level the relative importance of these prey in the bats diet strongly correlated to those sampled by the traps The differences in relative abundance of major insect orders between midnight and pre dawn sampling also correlated to those in percent volumes of respective insect orders in the bats diet. These results agree with our prediction and suggest an opportunistic foraging mode for this species Keywords: foraging resource bats Tadarida brasiliensis. 926:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Body size is associated with fundamental biological processes such as metabolism movement and the rate of reproduction and evolution. Although allometric principles should also influence the range of potential behavioral responses for a given organism evidence for such large scale and cross taxon relationships is lacking. If they exist scaling related changes in behavior should be prominent in predator prey interactions: body size affects the likelihood of attack and the costs of predator avoidance. We take a interspecific perspective on a traditionally intraspecific topic by using a 142 species data set containing organisms ranging over seven degrees of magnitude in body size to analyze the relationship between mean response to predation risk and both prey size and the predator : prey size ratio. We found a weak but significant relationship between two metrics of prey size (mean species level prey mass and mean species level predator : prey size ratio) and two of the five prey response variables: risk induced changes in prey habitat use and prey fecundity were significantly correlated with prey body size and the predator : prey ratio. Risk induced reductions in prey activity were positively correlated with prey mass. In contrast there was no correlation between prey mass or the predator : prey size ratio and risk induced changes in either prey growth and survival. We also document considerable variation in response to predation risk among taxa highlighting that many additional factors contribute to the effects of predation risk on prey behavior growth fecundity and survival. The weak but significant large scale relationships we documented in our work suggest that allometric relationships may play a subtle role in structuring some of a prey organisms response to predation risk. 942:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, EcoSim II uses results from the Ecopath procedure for trophic mass balance analysis to define biomass dynamics models for predicting temporal change in exploited ecosystems. Key populations can be represented in further detail by using delay difference models to account for both biomass and numbers dynamics. A major problem revealed by linking the population and biomass dynamics models is in representation of population responses to changes in food supply; simple proportional growth and reproductive responses lead to unrealistic predictions of changes in mean body size with changes in fishing mortality. EcoSim II allows users to specify life history mechanisms to avoid such unrealistic predictions: animals may translate changes in feeding rate into changes in reproductive rather than growth rates or they may translate changes in food availability into changes in foraging time that in turn affects predation risk. These options along with model relationships fur limits on prey availability caused by predation avoidance tactics tend to cause strong compensatory responses in modeled populations. It is likely that such compensatory responses are responsible for our inability to find obvious correlations between interacting trophic components in fisheries time series data. But Ecosim II does not just predict strong compensatory responses: it also suggests that large piscivores may be vulnerable to delayed recruitment collapses caused by increases in prey species that are in turn competitors predators of juvenile piscivores. 96:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The role of habitat choice behavior in the dynamics of predator prey systems is explored using simple mathematical models. The models assume a three species food chain in which each population is distributed across two or more habitats. The predator and prey adjust their locations dynamically to maximize individual per capita growth while the preys resource has a low rate of random movement. The two consumer species have Type II functional responses. For many parameter sets the populations cycle with predator and prey   chasing   each other back and forth between habitats. The cycles are driven by the aggregation of prey which is advantageous because the predators saturating functional response induces a short term positive density dependence in prey fitness. The advantage of aggregation in a patch is only temporary because resources are depleted and predators move to or reproduce faster in the habitat with the largest number of prey perpetuating the cycle. Such spatial cycling can stabilize population densities and qualitatively change the responses of population densities to environmental perturbations. These models show that the coupled processes of moving to habitats with higher fitness in predator and prey may often fail to produce ideal free distributions across habitats. 97:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,98:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article investigates some simple models of the evolutionary interaction between two prey species that share a common resource and a common predator. Each prey species is characterized by a trait that determines both the rate of resource capture and vulnerability to a predator. In a simple model of a three species food chain such traits usually increase in response to an imposed reduction in resource density. When the per capita growth rates of each of two prey species depend linearly on resource density such traits will change in opposite directions when the two prey come into sympatry. In addition the ratio of the effect of the predator on prey fitness to the effect of the resource on prey fitness will diverge from the corresponding ratio in a second prey species when those species coexist in sympatry. These simple predictions need not hold under several alternative assumptions which may be more common in biological systems. Parallel changes in sympatry may occur if the relationship between resource consumption and prey growth is nonlinear if the prey species have partial overlap in the set of resources used or in the set of predators that consume them or if prey experience direct intraspecific competition. The responses to a second prey can also differ significantly from those predicted by the simplest model if separate traits affect vulnerability to predators and resource acquisition rate. It is important to determine whether examples of character displacement previously interpreted as responses to competition for resources might also reflect responses to altered predation risks in sympatry. 991:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Some of the best empirical examples of life history evolution involve responses to predation. Nevertheless most life history theory dealing with responses to predation has not been formulated within an explicit dynamic food web context. In particular most previous theory does not explicitly consider the coupled population dynamics of the focal species and its predators and resources. Here we present a model of life history evolution that explores the evolutionary consequences of size specific predation on small individuals when there is a trade off between growth and reproduction. The model explicitly describes the population dynamics of a predator the prey of interest and its resource. The selective forces that cause life history evolution in the prey species emerge from the ecological interactions embodied by this model and can involve important elements of frequency dependence. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the coupling between predator and prey in the community determines many aspects of life history evolution. If the coupling is weak (as is implicitly assumed in many previous models) differences in resource productivity have no effect on the nature of life history evolution. A single life history strategy is favored that minimizes the equilibrium resource density (if possible). If the coupling is strong then higher resource productivities select for faster growth into the predation size refuge. Moreover under strong coupling it is also possible for natural selection to favor an evolutionary diversification of life histories possibly resulting in two coexisting species with divergent life history strategies. 99:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This article uses mathematical models to investigate the consequences of noninstantaneous choice between two prey types by a predator. The models are characterized by three features: sustained cycles in predator and prey population sizes a trade off between the predators consumption rates of the two prey and adaptive adjustment of the consumption rates at a rate proportional to the change in predator fitness per unit change in consumption rates. Adaptive adjustment of consumption rates frequently prevents the system from achieving an ideal free distribution of predator foraging effort and frequently results in chaotic dynamics or alternative attractors. The process of switching to consume the more common prey can reduce the minimum density of one or both prey. These phenomena occur for a variety of different models including models in which both prey are in the same or in distinct habitats. An ideal free distribution can often be attained by adding prey refuges or immigration provided these have a large enough effect on the dynamics of the system. The dynamics of switching can be important in determining indirect interactions between prey species and other aspects of food web dynamics. 1007:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, For more than two decades Jack Sepkoskis hypothesis of three great evolutionary faunas has dominated thinking about the Phanerozoic evolution of marine animals. This theory combines pattern description with process modelling: diversity trajectories of major taxonomic groups are sorted into three categories and the trajectories are predicted by coupled logistic equations. Here I use a re creation of Sepkoskis classic three phase coupled logistic model and an empirical analysis of his genus level compendium to re examine his claims about diversity dynamics. I employ a focal group variant of the proportional volatility G statistic to determine whether variation in turnover rates of focal taxonomic groups can be explained by the average rates for each group through time combined with average rates across all groups within each temporal bin. If growth is exponential and ecological interactions between pairs of groups are always similarly strong then groups will wax and wane very predictably and these statistics will always be insignificant. If instead growth is density dependent and there are no interactions significant volatility should be confined to periods of rapid radiations such as those following major mass extinctions. Finally if unusually strong pairwise interactions directly cause certain groups to succeed or fail then significant volatility in each competing group should be present during replacement episodes that are not tied to overall radiations or extinctions. Additionally if clustering groups into faunas is informative then summed faunal diversity histories will replicate the observed volatility of all groups treated separately. To illustrate the focal group method I apply it to diversity data for the major groups of Cenozoic North American mammals. Surprisingly the tests show that although some orders experience significant radiations and extinctions orders with visually similar trajectories such as archaic mostly Paleocene mammals fail to share dynamic properties. Volatility is far greater in Sepkoskis marine data with almost every class showing significant and strong deviations from background turnover rates. However Sepkoskis three phase model predicts these patterns inconsistently. As expected the Cambrian and Paleozoic faunas show high volatility during the hand off between them. However the hypothesized twin late Paleozoic and Jurassic early Cretaceous hand offs between the Paleozoic and Modern faunas are not marked by excessively rapid declines and increases. Instead the Modern evolutionary fauna shows highly unusual dynamic behaviour starting in the mid Cretaceous coincident with the Mesozoic marine revolution and well after the Paleozoic faunas decline. Sepkoskis categorization also generally fails to summarize overall volatility during long stretches of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Finally a multivariate statistical analysis shows that Sepkoskis model imperfectly summarizes volatility. The three great faunas can be distinguished but some minor classes fall in different clusters than one would expect  Polychaeta; Malacostraca) and the diversity dynamics of crinoidea are distinct from those of Paleozoic classes. Thus the results provide only partial confirmation of Sepkoskis model. The most important problem is the delayed radiation of the modern classes a pattern that implicates evolutionary innovation and or environmental change instead of temporally invariant dynamic laws operating across the Phanerozoic. 1014:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Holding both the true number of taxa and their evenness constant what is the effect of the shape of the abundance distribution on the number of sampled taxa? We examine the effects of three types of abundance distribution (geometric log normal and Zipf) on the expected number of sampled taxa using Hurlberts equation (1971 equation 14). First we examine the differences in the number of sampled taxa for the three distributions given the same true number of taxa and true evenness. Second we determine the sample sizes needed to find more taxa from a taxon rich low evenness collection than found in a taxon poor high evenness collection with the same model distribution. Independently of the true number of taxa and evenness the shape of the abundance distribution affects the number of taxa expected in a sample. Given moderate to large sample sizes a Zipf distribution will yield the most taxa whereas a geometric distribution will yield the fewest. When comparing collections with the same model distributions it takes the smallest sample sizes to recognize that a taxon rich low evenness Zipf distribution has more taxa than does a taxon poor high evenness Zipf distribution. It requires the largest sample sizes to do this when both are geometric distributions. A necessary implication of these results is that no simple evenness metric can predict the same number of sampled taxa given the same true number of taxa true evenness and sample size but different model distributions. 1028:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Modern Old World monkeys live in an array of habitats an ability that was established early in their evolutionary history. The Old World monkey radiation is commonly correlated with the general trend of climatic cooling in the Neogene and the associated increase in open habitats. However although they became more abundant and speciated extensively in the very late Miocene Pliocene and Pleistocene many of the major events in cercopithecoid evolution occurred before the onset of the late Miocene long cooling period. In the Plio Pleistocene regional environmental change and interspecific competition probably influenced the radiations of the Old World monkeys in Africa much more than did global climatic patterns. In southern Africa the evolution of the monkey community is tied to Pleistocene increases in grassland and open habitats. In East Africa the more diverse cercopithecid fauna reflects the presence of a wider variety of habitats including forest woodland and grassland. 1038:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tracing the variability of reef production over long temporal scales is important to approach natural processes favoring or suppressing reef growth. Raw compilations of reef abundance per unit of time do not necessarily depict biologically meaningful patterns because the waxing and waning of reefs might just follow the quality of the fossil record that is the amount of paleontological information that is available in general. Here I standardize the published record of Phanerozoic reefs as stored in the PaleoReefs database to the published record of marine invertebrate fossils as stored in the Paleobiology Database. The sampling standardized peaks in reef growth are essentially identical to those of previous studies but significant peaks are rare. Times when unusual changes in ecological conditions are likely to control changes in metazoan reef proliferation were identified in the Late Devonian Late Triassic Late Jurassic and Neogene. 1048:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An online survey of ecology and evolution editors was conducted to assess the characteristics of journal editors and describe manuscript handling practices. A total of 450 respondents representing 155 ecology and evolution journals participated. The following patterns were detected: (1) there are more male than female editors; (2) the greater the number of manuscripts handled per year by editors the lower the proportion are rejected without review; and (3) previous review time scientific status and seniority of reviewers are factors that editors consider when selecting a reviewer. This research highlights the potential importance of editor characteristics in the peer review process; we suggest that increased transparency promotes both recognition of the editor population and more equitable reviewing practices. 1089:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Lithified marine sediments am not equitably distributed through time raising the possibility that lithification masks biological signals when data from unlithified and lithified sediments are compared or combined. Using mollusk dominated assemblages from the early Cenozoic of the Gulf Coastal Plain we find that lithification conceals small taxa decreases taxonomic resolution and exacerbates the undersampling of rare taxa. Lithified assemblages appear less diverse and have less even abundance distributions than coeval unlithified samples. These limitations cannot be overcome by standardization procedures nor are they likely to be circumvented by collecting larger samples. The effects of this bias however can be mitigated by restricting analyses to a single lithification state or to specific size classes. Since lithification selectively obscures small taxa the magnitude of this bias will be most severe when organisms are particularly small such as in the aftermath of mass extinctions. In the study area lithification artificially protracts the recovery period following the Cretaceous Paleogene mass extinction by similar to 7 m.y. 1091:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Traditional paleontological diversity curves are based on tallies of all taxa appearing in formally defined time units. These tallies are thought to be robust to further data collection. Thus they supposedly do not reflect nuisance factors like variable time unit lengths and sampling intensity biases. A comparison of a decade old North American Cenozoic mammal diversity curve and a newer database shows major differences. At least three major factors differentiate the two: use of shorter fixed length time intervals; restriction of counts to taxa that cross boundaries between intervals; and correction for variation in sampling intensity. The difference between genus and species level data also was examined but appears to be minor by comparison. Because at best only one pattern can be close to the true historical trajectory the analyses suggest that the new data and protocols together have yielded a curve that is converging on an accurate signal. 1092:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We compiled the global onshore offshore distribution of marine bryozoans within 396 Permian Early Jurassic bryozoan assemblages and show that bryozoan assemblage generic richness declined significantly in advance of the end Permian and end Triassic mass extinctions starting as early as the Capitanian prior to the end Permian and the Norian prior to the end Triassic. We also show that offshore settings were affected first prior to both extinctions suggesting that environmental stress resulted from the gradual encroachment of some deepwater phenomenon onto the shelves. These patterns support long term oceanographic rather than extraterrestrial extinction mechanisms such as widespread euxinia triggered by massive volcanism and global warming. Tracking the onshore offshore environmental distribution of these marine invertebrates provides a unique approach to assessing prolonged environmentally induced stress through this similar to 120 m.y. time interval. 1245:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To evaluate the influence of geographical distribution on the extinction risk of benthic marine invertebrates using data from the fossil record both during times of background extinction and across a mass extinction episode. Total geographical range is contrasted with proxies of global abundance to assess the relationships between the two essential components of geographical distribution and extinction risk. A global occurrence data base of fossil benthic macro organisms from the Triassic and Jurassic periods was used for this study. Geographical distributions and biodiversity dynamics were assessed for each genus (all taxa) or species (bivalves) based on a sample standardized data set and palaeogeographical reconstructions. Geographical ranges were measured by the maximum great circle distance of a taxon within a stratigraphic interval. Global abundance was assessed by the number of localities at which a taxon was recorded. Widespread and rare taxa were separated using median and percentile values of the frequency distributions of occurrences. The frequency distribution of geographical ranges is very similar to that for modern taxa. Although no significant correlation could be established between local abundance and geographical range proxies of global abundance are strongly correlated with geographical range. Taxon longevities are correlated with both mean geographical range and mean global abundance but range size appears to be more critical than abundance in determining extinction risk. These results are valid when geographical distribution is treated as a trait of taxa and when assessed for individual geological stages. Geographical distribution is a key predictor of extinction risk of Triassic and Jurassic benthic marine invertebrates. An important exception is in the end Triassic mass extinction which equally affected geographically restricted and widespread genera as well as common and rare genera. This suggests that global diversity crises may curtail the role of geographical distribution in determining extinction risk. 1281:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Comparison of the duration onset conditions and biotic response to the four Phanerozoic glaciations suggests that there are two Phanerozoic glacial modes. Late Ordovician glaciation typifies short duration high atmospheric CO(2) events characterized by cosmopolitan faunal distributions and two episodes of catastrophic extinction. Pennsylvanian Permian and Cenozoic glaciation typify long duration low atmospheric CO(2) events characterized by abundant biogeographic differentiation and stable or rising biotic diversity. Late Devonian glaciation appears most similar to Late Ordovician glaciation: it had a short duration; Late Devonian biotas were cosmopolitan; and Late Devonian glaciation was associated with increased extinction at the Devonian Carboniferous boundary. On the basis of biotic response we would predict high atmospheric CO(2) levels at the time of Devonian glaciation. However the Berner GeoCarb curve suggests relatively low atmospheric CO(2) levels in the Late Devonian. 1282:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Temporal patterns of origination and extinction are essential components of many paleontological studies but it has been difficult to obtain accurate rate estimates because the observed record of first and last appearances is distorted by the incompleteness of the fossil record. Here I analyze observed first and last appearances of marine animal and microfossil genera in a way that explicitly takes incompleteness and its variation into consideration. This approach allows estimates of true rates of origination and extinction throughout the Phanerozoic. Substantial support is provided for the proposition that most rate peaks in the raw data are real in the sense that they do not arise as a consequence of temporal variability in the overall quality of the fossil record. Even though the existence of rate anomalies is supported their timing is nevertheless open to question in many cases. If one assumes that rates of origination and extinction are constant through a given stratigraphic interval then peaks in revised origination rates tend to be displaced backward and extinction peaks forward relative to the peaks in the raw data. If however one assumes a model of pulsed turnover with true originations concentrated at lower interval boundaries and true extinctions concentrated at upper interval boundaries the apparent timing of extinction peaks is largely reliable at face value. Thus whereas rate anomalies may well be real precisely when they occurred is a question that cannot be answered definitively without independent support for a model of smooth versus pulsed rate variation. The pattern of extinction particularly the major events is more faithfully represented in the fossil record than that of origination. There is a tendency for the major extinction events to occur during stages in which the quality of the record is relatively high and for recoveries from extinctions to occur when the record is less complete. These results imply that interpretations of origination and extinction history that depend only on the existence of rate anomalies are fairly robust whereas interpretations of the timing of events and the temporal covariation between origination and extinction may require substantial revision. 1283:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The preservation of nonrapidly buried autochthonous shell concentrations with noncementing epifaunal animals in life position presents a taphonomic dilemma if in fact an increase in shelliness is driven by a decrease in sedimentation rate. A 150 cm thick densely packed shell bed with brachiopods from the Lower Jurassic of Morocco shows lower levels of postmortem alteration than shell poor beds indicating that its formation is primarily governed by variations in hardpart input rates. Varying dominance and size structure of the main shell producer brachiopod Zeilleria rehmanni indicate that its increased population density was the main trigger in the shell bed formation. Thinner and less common microbial crusts in the shell bed than in shell poor beds indicate that higher shelliness is not due to lack of sediment. On the basis of actualistic data from modern mussel and oyster shell beds the suspension feeding of a high density population leads to high biodeposition rates through production of feces and pseudofeces which substantially exceed natural sedimentation rates. In addition shell rich areas preferentially trap more suspended sediment than shell poor areas. Therefore an increase in population density of shelly biodeposit producers should lead to higher biodeposition rates. This assumption is supported by a positive correlation between brachiopod shelliness and pellet abundance. Both active biodeposition and passive trapping of sediment would have increased sedimentation rate thus leading to a decreased rate of shell destruction through suppression of predators or borers as well as stabilization and protection of the shell concentration. Under optimum ecologic conditions these processes result in a positive feedback between an increased hardpart input rate and increased biogenic sedimentation rate. This scenario thus provides one alternative pathway for formation of well preserved shell concentrations formed by epifaunal suspension feeders. Identifying the importance of biodeposition is of environmental significance because it implies that carbonate sediment was produced largely in situ and was directly or indirectly related to the activity of shell producers. Recognizing the role of varying hardpart input rates in shell concentration genesis is of ecologic significance because shelliness can directly reflect abundance fluctuations of shell producers. 1284:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We estimate the effects of three biases on the observed alpha diversity of paleocommunities from the Middle Paleozoic and Late Cenozoic. The first bias results from the preferential dissolution of aragonite relative to calcite; this bias can lower the relative abundance and preserved diversity of aragonitic taxa potentially lowering the rarefied diversity of an entire fossil assemblage. We model the effects of this bias by analytically reinserting aragonitic specimens and taxa into Paleozoic assemblages that have been described in the literature. The aragonitic specimens are inserted using a wide range of reasonable assumptions about the original local paleocommunity composition. Although the dissolution bias is probably not as severe as has been argued by some our analytical modeling indicates that the average Paleozoic assemblage may have lost up to 29 PeRcEnT of its total diversity. The second bias results from the higher diversity of the tropics relative to temperate latitudes but the Late Cenozoic collections we analyzed from the literature represent temperate assemblages whereas the Paleozoic collections were tropical in origin ( the northward drift of North America and Europe through time caused this difference). On the basis of latitudinal diversity gradients in the Late Cenozoic the diversity of the temperate Late Cenozoic samples should be at least doubled for an accurate comparison to the tropical Paleozoic samples. The third bias is environmental: our Late Cenozoic samples tend to come from more onshore stressed habitats than the Paleozoic samples. In our study this factor should reduce the apparent diversity of Late Cenozoic paleocommunities by about 9 PeRcEnT. After correcting for these biases standardized alpha diversity appears to increase by a factor of 3.0 3.7 from the Middle Paleozoic to the Late Cenozoic. Previous studies that did not correct for these biases suggested that alpha diversity increased by a factor of 2.5 times; the earlier studies produced approximately correct results because ( by chance) the effects of the biases largely cancel out. In the   consensus   article on marine diversity history an observed increase in alpha diversity was taken as powerful support for an increase in global diversity from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic. Although we do not test all conflating factors this study provides new rigor to this longstanding view on alpha diversity change in the Phanerozoic. 1317:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In A brief commentary Smith broadly dismisses several newly developed phylogenetic methods that make use of temporal data. In this comment I wish to concur with other critics of Smith and in particular expand on an argument of Fisher . regarding stratocladistics and the divisibility of paleontological time scales. Smiths strongest and most detailed argument is that With enough subdivisions of time . . . stratigraphic debt can be made sufficiently large to overturn any phylogeny based on morphology . . . As pointed out by Fisher . Clyde and Fisher actually employed a rather conservative algorithm for defining the number of time intervals. Here I argue that stratocladistics fundamentally depends on global temporal durations of fossil taxa not just on their ranges across individual (or even composite) stratigraphic sections and that these durations are intrinsically expressed in discrete not continuous units. Thus paleontological time scales cannot be subdivided arbitrarily and are not literally stratigraphic. I also discuss additional objective criteria for limiting temporal subdivision which show that a series of stratocladistic studies involving North American mammals actually have underdivided the time scale. Thus stratocladistics does not allow for infinite temporal subdivision either in principle or in practice. TIME AND STRATIGRAPHY Smith almost casually mentions that there always may be enough subdivision of time to create as much stratigraphic debt as one might want. Smith nowhere explains why. One might think so because the literature has used stratigraphy and time as virtual synonyms; local stratigraphic sections are measured in continuous units such as meters; and perhaps then time is mathematically continuous and infinitely divisible. Alternatively in an illustration Smith shows subdivisions of absolute time and numerical time scales also are necessarily discrete and fundamentally different from measured sections. The terms time and stratigraphy. Almost all of the large literature on stratocladistics and on related stratigraphic measures of the quality of the fossil record has used the term stratigraphic to mean having to do with time. The very terms stratocladistics and stratophenetics are formed by using stratigraphy as a shorthand for temporal data. Indeed Fox . flatly defined stratigraphic data as the temporal order of specimens in the fossil record. Stratigraphic also is overused as a synonym for temporal in the larger paleontological geological literature the North American Stratigraphic Code; the International Stratigraphic Guide of the International Subcommission on Stratigraphic Classification . However stratigraphy in a literal sense only has to do with the description and analysis of stratified rocks rock strata or stratified (layered) rocks; the arrangement of strata. Meanwhile Hedberg uses chronostratigraphy to mean the study of the age of strata and as a subset of geochronology not the other way around. Finally Harland . refer to chronometric and chronostratic time scales only tying the latter to stratigraphy. Numerical time scales of the kind used for example by Wills are clearly not chronostratic but chronometric. In sum all responsible authors should agree that stratigraphy and stratigraphic concern rocks not time so the terms chronology and temporal should always be preferred in the phylogenetic literature. Local vs. regional and global scales of stratocladistic analyses. Putting terminology aside some stratocladistic studies do focus on a single local stratigraphic section. So it might be logically justified (if uncharitable) to argue that stratocladists might overdivide their time scales just by slicing up their sections too narrowly. Of course sections are not arbitrarily and infinitely divisible because the rock record accumulates at variable rates and omits variable amounts of time in between depositional packages. Furthermore very small stratigraphic intervals would break up sedimentary packages that were laid down in single events. Regardless most applications of stratigraphic methods in phylogenetics have relied upon continental or intercontinental paleontological time scales which are not even simple agglomerations of stratigraphic sections: they are empirical hypotheses about the ordering of real world biological events. Quantitative biochronology and stratigraphy. One still could try to translate these discrete broad based time scales into continuous stratigraphic units by means of quantitative correlation methods. Indeed a large body of literature on graphic correlation seeks to do just this. However graphic correlation actually seeks to find best fit hypothetical arrangements of discrete biological events such as first and last appearance events (not appearance datums which pertain only to individual local stratigraphic sections). As stated by Shaw the only objective temporal facts that a fossil species can supply__the only epochs it can mark in the rocks__are the beginning and end of its range. More importantly numerous rival methods do not generate continuous master stratigraphic sections (archaeological seriation; probabilistic biostratigraphy; unitary associations; appearance event ordination). Their common currency is discrete appearance event sequences which need not correspond perfectly to any one local stratigraphy and typically are computable even from taxonomic inventories of fossil collections that have unknown stratigraphic interrelationships. Thus objective quantitative paleontological time scales are not simply stratigraphy writ large. Admittedly most of these methods are said to concern quantitative biostratigraphy not time per se. However biostratigraphy itself only has to do with vertical distributions of fossils in rocks per se and with characterizations of strata on the basis of fossils. Thus methods like unitary associations and appearance event ordination that are independent of superposition are not strictly biostratigraphic and we need another term__i.e. biochronology__for the combination of biostratigraphic data and inventory data. Global time scales and stratigraphy . Of course most realworld paleontological time scales still are constructed using qualitative non statistical criteria. However traditional criteria are themselves directly translatable into the currency of first and last appearances. All biostratigraphic time scales reduce to interval assemblage or abundance zones. Any interval or assemblage zone is defined by the combinations of overlapping ranges which are just sets of appearance events. Abundance zones are not routinely used and have been rejected by most quantitative workers. Some workers tie names of paleontological time intervals to reference localities (but the temporal correlations underpinning such time scales always can be expressed in terms of appearance events. In summary paleontological time scales always reduce to discrete historical events so stratocladistics related phylogenetic methods and the so called stratigraphic fit measures all have to work with event based time scales whenever they stray from local stratigraphic sections. Algorithmically these methods only make sense in the first place if they do at some level correspond with global biochronology__as recognized by Clyde and Fisher and Bodenbender and Fisher who required that each of their stratigraphic intervals be bounded on each end by at least one event. Perhaps then stratocladistics is better called chronocladistics. CONSTRAINTS ON SUBDIVIDING TIME SCALES Smith also has failed to indicate that numerous logical and quantitative criteria may be used to limit the subdivision of time scales and that there are specific reasons to favor the level of precision actually used in stratocladistic analyses of the mammalian record. Logical limits . Both quantitative methods and formal nomenclatural rules define time intervals directly on the basis of appearance events and each taxon may have only one first and one last appearance. Thus paleontological time scales never can break out more than twice as many intervals as taxa and the maximum number of intervals is necessarily finite. Furthermore each time interval must uniquely include at least one compositionally unique fossil collection. Otherwise it would not be possible to tie at least one appearance event to the time interval. Stratocladistics and all related methods are of course subject to these two constraints. Similarly Clyde and Fisher and Bodenbender and Fisher counted intervals only if they included fossils pinning down appearances of ingroup taxa. Thus intervals were required to sample fossiliferous horizons. Thanks to emphasizing only fossils of ingroup taxa this criterion is even more conservative than the two mentioned here. Limits based on diachrony . The divisibility of time scales is further limited by the precision of paleontological correlations. Some authors equate precision with the average diachrony of individual appearance events seen in multiple regions a figure often given in studies of Cenozoic deep sea microfossils. Importantly the average interregional diachrony of North American mammalian species is 1.4 m.y. Of course if time intervals are actually based on appearances of a few taxa selected specifically because they exhibit low diachrony then these general average estimates will be too liberal at least when it comes to interval boundaries. However paleontologists routinely fail to identify low diachrony taxa. Thus average diachronies do provide a rough estimate of the point at which further subdivision of a time scale would become reckless. Limits based on calibration error . Researchers also have tried to estimate precision directly by calibrating paleontological time scales against independent geochronological age estimates most famously including Harland . Quantitative analyses of fossil mammal biochronology provide numerous estimates and average 95 percent confidence intervals typically are as low as 1.4 m.y. Limits based on the precision accuracy tradeoff. An even more direct approach is to examine the tradeoff between precision and accuracy as time scales are subdivided by comparing observed appearances with true fullyresolved appearance dates estimated by adding 50 percent confidence intervals. The inferred optimal interval length for the North American mammalian time scale is about 0.7 m.y. Stratocladistic precision in practice. The 0.7 m.y. precision figure is quite close to the average interval lengths actually used in key stratocladistic studies: Clyde and Fisher subdivided the Tiffanian through early Bridgerian mammal ages into eight intervals averaging about 1.5 m.y.; Polly subdivided the Clarkforkian and Wasatchian into 10 intervals averaging 0.65 m.y.; and Bloch . subdivided the Paleocene into eight intervals averaging 1.4 m.y. The one major stratocladistic study not involving mammals defined just 18 intervals for almost the entire Paleozoic. In his brief comments on the subject Smith made it appear that the entire problem of time scale resolution is subjective and arbitrary. His argument only could have resulted from a misreading of recent literature on both stratocladistics and quantitative biochronology: multiple objective criteria do exist and they all suggest that Clyde and Fisher Polly and Bloch . used entirely conservative temporal schemes.  1330:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that sea level change was a fundamental parameter determining the distribution of fossil marine organisms. Although a similar relationship is generally assumed for the continental fossil record this intuition remains speculative. Quantitative evidence reveals no correlation between sea level variations and the distribution of continental tetrapods in the Late Jurassic Eocene interval. The quality of the continental fossil record depends on many more factors than just eustatic changes. 1385:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The deep sea supports a diverse and highly endemic invertebrate fauna the origin or which remains obscure. Little is known about geographic variation in deep sea organisms or the evolutionary processes that promote population level differentiation and eventual speciation. Sequence variation at the 16 S rDNA locus was examined in formalin preserved specimens of the common upper bathyal rissoid Frigidoalvania brychia (Verrill 1884) to examine its population genetic structure. The specimens came from trawl samples taken over 30 years ago at depths of 457 1 102 m at stations in the Northwest Atlantic south of Woods Hole Massachusetts USA. Near the upper boundary or its bathymetric range (500 m) extremely divergent haplotypes comprising three phylogenetically distinct clades (average uncorrected sequence divergence among clades similar to23 PeRcEnT similar to3 PeRcEnT within clades) were found at stations separated by a maximum distance of similar to80 km suggesting the presence of high levels of intraspecific divergence or the possibility of morphologically cryptic species. Only one of these clades was found at two stations in the mid to lower part of F. brychias depth distribution (800 1 100 m) suggesting lower clade diversity with increasing depth although among sample divergence with a single exception was minimal One station was genetically divergent from all others sampled containing a unique suite of haplotypes including two found only at this site. Steep vertical selective gradients major oceanographic changes during the late Cenozoic and habitat fragmentation by submarine canyons might have contributed to an upper bathyal region that is highly conducive to evolutionary change. 1386:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The origin of the deep sea benthic fauna is poorly under stood and represents an enormous gap in our understanding of basic evolutionary phenomena. One obstacle to studying evolutionary patterns in the deep sea has been the technical difficulty of measuring genetic variation in species that are typically minute rare and must be recovered from extreme depths. We used molecular genetic techniques to quantify variation in the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene within and among populations of the common protobranch bivalve Demimucula atacellana (Schenck 1939). We analyzed 89 individuals from nine samples collected in the 1960s along a depth gradient from 1100 to 3800 m in the western North Atlantic. Genetic variability within populations :is much lower than between populations and peak haplotype numbers occur near the center of its depth distribution. Continental slope ( 2500m) and rise (   2500 m) populations were genetically distinct despite the lack of any obvious topographic or oceanographic features that would impede gene flow. These findings indicate that the deep sea macrofauna can have strong population structure over small(134 km) spatial scales similar to that observed in shallow water and terrestrial organisms. This surprisingly high biodiversity at the genetic level affords the potential for adaptation and evolutionary diversification the ultimate historical causes of high species diversity in the deep sea benthos. 139:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most of our knowledge of biodiversity and its causes in the deep sea benthos derives from regional scale sampling studies of the macrofauna. Improved sampling methods and the expansion of investigations into a wide variety of habitats have revolutionized our understanding of the deep sea. Local species diversity shows clear geographic variation on spatial scales of 100 1000 km. Recent sampling programs have revealed unexpected complexity in community structure at the landscape level that is associated with large scale oceanographic processes and their environmental consequences. We review the relationships between variation in local species diversity and the regional scale phenomena of boundary constraints gradients of productivity sediment heterogeneity oxygen availability hydrodynamic regimes and catastrophic physical disturbance. We present a conceptual model of how these interdependent environmental factors shape regional scale variation in local diversity. Local communities in the deep sea may be composed of species that exist as metapopulations whose regional distribution depends on a balance among global scale landscape scale and small scale dynamics. Environmental gradients may form geographic patterns of diversity by influencing local processes such as predation resource partitioning competitive exclusion and facilitation that determine species coexistence. The measurement of deep sea species diversity remains a vital issue in comparing geographic patterns and evaluating their potential causes. Recent assessments of diversity using species accumulation curves with randomly pooled samples confirm the often disputed claim that the deep sea supports higher diversity than the continental shelf. However more intensive quantitative sampling is required to fully characterize the diversity of deep sea sediments the most extensive habitat on Earth. Once considered to be constant spatially uniform and isolated deep sea sediments are now recognized as a dynamic richly textured environment that is inextricably linked to the global biosphere. Regional studies of the last two decades provide the empirical background necessary to formulate and test specific hypotheses of causality by controlled sampling designs and experimental approaches. 1409:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A new field method for tar quantification was used at Coal Oil Point (COP) California to study the mechanisms transporting oil tar from the nearby COP natural marine hydrocarbon seep field. This method segregates tar pieces into six size classes and assigns them an average mass based on laboratory or direct field measurements. Tar accumulation on the 19 927 in 2 survey area was well resolved spatially by recording tar mass along twelve transects segmented into 4 m(2) blocks and then integrating over the survey area. A seasonal trend was apparent in total tar in which summer accumulations were an order of magnitude higher than winter accumulations. Based on multiple regression analyses between environmental data and tar accumulation 34 PeRcEnT of tar variability is explained by a combination of onshore advection via wind and low swell height inhibiting slick dispersion. 143:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Bioinformatics the application of computational tools to the management and analysis of biological data has stimulated rapid research advances in genomics through the development of data archives such as GenBank and similar progress is just beginning within ecology. One reason for the belated adoption of informatics approaches in ecology is the breadth of ecologically pertinent data (from genes to the biosphere) and its highly heterogeneous nature. The variety of formats logical structures and sampling methods in ecology create significant challenges. Cultural barriers further impede progress especially for the creation and adoption of data standards. Here we describe informatics frameworks for ecology from subject specific data warehouses to generic data collections that use detailed metadata descriptions and formal ontologies to catalog and cross reference information. Combining these approaches with automated data integration techniques and scientific workflow systems will maximize the value of data and open new frontiers for research in ecology. 1451:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central goal of evolutionary ecology is to identify the general features maintaining the diversity of species assemblages(1 3). Understanding the taxonomic and ecological characteristics of ecological communities provides a means to develop and test theories about the processes that regulate species coexistence and diversity. Here using data from woody plant communities from different biogeographic regions continents and geologic time periods we show that the number of higher taxa is a general power function of species richness that is significantly different from randomized assemblages. In general we find that local communities are characterized by fewer higher taxa than would be expected by chance. The degree of taxonomic diversity is influenced by modes of dispersal and potential biotic interactions. Further changes in local diversity are accompanied by regular changes in the partitioning of community biomass between taxa that are also described by a power function. Our results indicate that local and regional processes(2) have consistently regulated community diversity and biomass partitioning for millions of years. 1465:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Did the end Cretaceous mass extinction event by eliminating non avian dinosaurs and most of the existing fauna trigger the evolutionary radiation of present day mammals? Here we construct date and analyse a species level phylogeny of nearly all extant Mammalia to bring a new perspective to this question. Our analyses of how extant lineages accumulated through time show that net per lineage diversification rates barely changed across the Cretaceous Tertiary boundary. Instead these rates spiked significantly with the origins of the currently recognized placental superorders and orders approximately 93 million years ago before falling and remaining low until accelerating again throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs. Our results show that the phylogenetic fuses leading to the explosion of extant placental orders are not only very much longer than suspected previously but also challenge the hypothesis that the end Cretaceous mass extinction event had a major direct influence on the diversification of todays mammals. 1480:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The causes of mass extinctions and the nature of biological selectivity during extinction events remain central questions in palaeobiology. Although many different environmental perturbations have been invoked as extinction mechanisms it has long been recognized that fluctuations in sea level coincide with many episodes of biotic turnover. Recent work supports the hypothesis that changes in the areas of epicontinental seas have influenced the macroevolution of marine animals but the extent to which differential environmental turnover has contributed to extinction selectivity remains unknown. Here I use a new compilation of the temporal durations of sedimentary rock packages to show that carbonate and terrigenous clastic marine shelf environments have different spatio temporal dynamics and that these dynamics predict patterns of genus level extinction extinction selectivity and diversity among Sepkoskis Palaeozoic and modern evolutionary faunae(9). These results do not preclude a role for biological interactions or unusual physical events as drivers of macroevolution but they do suggest that the turnover of marine shelf habitats and correlated environmental changes have been consistent determinants of extinction extinction selectivity and the shifting composition of the marine biota during the Phanerozoic eon. 1491:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Marine calcifying organisms that produce sediments and build reefs generally have skeletons and shells that are composed of either aragonite or calcite. Long term changes in the estimated Mg Ca ratios of sea water tend to correspond to changes in the prevailing mineralogy of these creatures. High Mg Ca ratios are expected to favour the spread of aragonitic organisms whereas calcitic taxa are thought to benefit from low Mg Ca ratios. Here we test these patterns throughout the Phanerozoic eon and assess the relative impacts of changing ocean chemistry and mass extinctions on the evolutionary success of calcifying organisms. We find that mass extinctions are more important in regulating long term patterns of skeletal mineralogy than the Mg Ca ratios of the global oceans. Furthermore selective recovery from mass extinctions is usually more important than selective extinction in driving the Phanerozoic pattern of skeletal mineralogy. But even in the recovery phase there is no clear connection between changes in the dominance of aragonite or calcite and the Mg Ca ratio of the oceans thus providing further evidence for the complexity of biotic recoveries. 1494:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Three recent developments illuminate the relationships between trans specific evolution and ecologic processes: (1) paleoecologic studies suggest the fossil record is not so much a poor reflection of short term small scale ecology as it is a robust document of regional ecologic systems; (2) work on coordinated stasis points to possible connections between species stasis and stability of regional ecosystems; and (3) evolutionary theorists are rediscovering significance of ecologic processes in speciation. Viewed together species level evolution is always happening but significant coordinated morphologic evolution (reflecting the enthronement of species in new economies) may occur only when regional ecosystems are reorganized replaced. 1501:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Deep sea ecosystems are the most extensive and remote ecosystems on Earth. Perception of the deep sea benthic environment has changed dramatically in the last century from one of an azoic or at least species poor habitat to one that is rich in species. The early misconception was created in part by evidence of vast monotonous expanses of cold dark sediment plains with little obvious spatial or temporal heterogeneity. Given that many species rich ecosystems on Earth are obviously heterogeneous it is surprising that some estimates of species numbers in the deep sea  similar to10(7) macrofaunal species) rival those for tropical rainforests. Although other estimates are more conservative  5 X 10(5) macrofaunal species) it is clear that deep sea benthic habitats contain many species. The paradox of high deep sea diversity has generated a number of explanatory hypotheses including some that are currently difficult to test and others that are the focus of ongoing study. Approaches include analyses of local regional and global patterns and experimental manipulations within habitats. Mechanistic generalisations are difficult to make because experimentation and sampling coverage are spatially and temporally limited but evidence to date suggests that small scale habitat variability and patchy disturbance as well as global and regional variability may play roles in maintaining deep sea diversity. The importance of small scale habitat variability and patchy disturbance has been demonstrated for only a small subset of species many of which are opportunists. Broad inferences from global and regional patterns of species diversity are debatable because many areas remain poorly sampled and causes of patterns are ambiguous. Nonetheless our understanding of diversity patterns in the deep sea benthos has increased dramatically in the last three decades. If the approaching decades hold even a portion of the surprises seen in the recent past then science can expect very exciting discoveries from the deep ocean in the near future. 1572:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although actualistic live dead comparisons lead to robust estimates of fidelity of modem death assemblages quantitative evaluation of fidelity of fossil assemblage remains uncertain. In this paper effects of storm reworking on compositional fidelity of the Upper Triassic shell concentrations (Eastern Alps Austria) are evaluated. An exploratory approach is based on comparison of reworked and non reworked assemblages in ordination analyses. Non reworked assemblages of one or more communities provide a baseline for evaluation of fidelity of reworked assemblages. In siliciclastic rich intervals of the Kossen Formation shell concentrations are represented by (1) packstones with small shallow infaunal bivalves (2) floatstones and pavements with large semi infaunal bivalves and (3) bioclastic marlstones. In carbonate rich intervals bioclastic floatstones with bivalves and brachiopods occur. Analyzing all shell concentrations eight sample groups sharing similar species composition are discriminated. Limited effect of storm reworking on composition of shell concentrations is indicated by (1) a general persistence of six sample groups when only non reworked assemblages are analyzed (2) similarity in composition between reworked and non reworked assemblages within sample groups and (3) compositional segregation between non reworked assemblages of distinctive sample groups mostly without any reworked assemblages of intermediate composition. Depth related variations in dead shell production shell destruction and body size governed preservation and distribution of the shell concentrations along onshore offshore gradient in the Kossen Basin. First at times when environmental conditions were unfavorable for shell producers coupled with high background shell destruction rates limestone beds formed during storm events were shell poor. Second less common shell concentrations in upper than in lower parts of siliciclastic intervals can be related to higher environmental stress in shallower habitats. Third the difference between shell concentrations dominated by small and large bivalves is driven by between babitat differences in body size and is not due to a differential sorting of small and large shells. Combining community analysis based on species abundances with taphonomic analysis can thus be helpful in tracking fidelity of fossil assemblages. 1573:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Estimates of past diversity using palaeontological evidence can be achieved within two main analytical frameworks. The traditional taxic approach makes a straightforward use of stratigraphic ranges at a given taxonomic level whereas the phylogenetic approach derives palaeodiversity estimates from both phylogenetic topologies and stratigraphic occurrences. At lower taxonomic levels the taxic and phylogenetic approaches have limitations for several groups because of the incompleteness of the fossil record and the frequent absence of stable comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses. In particular fossil specimens unidentifiable at lower taxonomic levels are frequently discarded from both kinds of diversity analysis. However these specifically or generically indeterminate occurrences may prove crucial for recovering minimal lineage level diversity patterns especially for groups with poor fossil records. Diversity counts can be achieved by a simple intuitive protocol that incorporates all fossil occurrences and minimal principles of evolutionary continuity. This method intermediate between the taxic and the phylogenetic approaches has received little attention among palaeobiologists so far although it holds great promises for diversity Studies. Here this alternative method is extended generalised and tested. When empirical occurrence data are artificially degraded the technique captures an equal or a better part of the original diversity signal than the taxic approach. This method is applied here to an original locality level compilation of fossil lissamphibians occurring in the Late Jurassic Eocene interval. This empirical study provides the first global lineage level palaeodiversity estimate ever made for this group and it shows that specifically indeterminate occurrences and evolutionary continuity can increase species diversity estimates by 400 PeRcEnT. The major implications of this work are that (1) palaeontological reports and datasets should record all fossil occurrences regardless of the taxonomic level at which they are diagnostic; (2) it seems preferable to abandon the old commitment of using only taxa assigned to the same rank in diversity analyses; (3) the clade Lissamphibia has experienced a virtually extinction free gradual rise during the Late Jurassic Eocene interval; (4) long term climatic disruptions for the K T bio event and hypothetical megabiases in the Late Cretaceous fossil record of small terrestrial vertebrates are unlikely. 1575:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The extinction and recovery of scleractinian corals at the Cretaceous Tertiary (K T) boundary was analyzed based on a Global database of taxonomically revised late Campanian to Paleocene coral collections. In contrast to earlier statements our results indicate that extinction rates of corals were only moderate in comparison to other marine invertebrates. We have calculated a 30 PeRcEnT extinction rate for Maastrichtian coral genera occurring in more than one stratigraphic stage and more than one geographic region. Reverse rarefaction suggests that some 45 PeRcEnT of all coral species became extinct. Photosymbiotic (zooxanthellate) corals were significantly more affected by the extinction than azooxanthellate corals; colonial forms were hit harder than solitary forms and among colonial forms an elevated integration of corallites raised extinction risk. Abundance as measured by the number of taxonomic occurrences had apparently no influence on survivorship but a wide geographic distribution significantly reduced extinction risk. As in bivalves and echinoids neither species richness within genera nor larval type had an effect on survivorship. An indistinct latitudinal gradient is visible in the extinction but this is exclusively due to a higher proportion of extinction resistant azooxanthellate corals in higher latitude assemblages. No significant geographic hotspot could be recognized neither in overall extinction rates nor in the extinction of endemic clades. More clades than previously recognized passed through the K T boundary only to become extinct within the Danian. These failed survivors were apparently limited to regions outside the Americas. Recovery as defined by the proportional increase of newly evolved genera was more rapid for zooxanthellate corals than previously assumed and less uniform geographically than the extinction. Although newly evolved Danian azooxanthellate genera were significantly more common than new zooxanthellate genera the difference nearly disappeared by the late Paleocene suggesting a more rapid recovery of zooxanthellate corals in comparison to previous analyses. New Paleocene genera were apparently concentrated in low latitudes suggesting that the tropics formed a source of evolutionary novelty in the recovery phase. 1577:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The PaleoReefs Database indicates that reef abundance increased profoundly during the Triassic period from a pronounced low in the Early Triassic to a major peak in the Norian. This expansion is also evident when standardizing for sampling. Corresponding to the reef expansion is a relative increase of scleractinian corals as reef builders whereas the contribution of hypercalcifying sponges and microbes decreased during the Triassic. The numerical expansion of corals is paralleled by a proportional increase of morphological features that are suggestive of photosymbiosis such that the Norian reef boom might be explained by the spread of photosymbiosis in corals. The geographical expansion of reefs was far less pronounced especially concerning palaeolatitude. Late Triassic reef growth was limited to more or less the same latitudinal range as modern reefs. As oxygen isotope data and new modeling results indicate declining temperatures and CO(2) concentrations during the Late Triassic the lack of latitudinal expansion might be attributed to global cooling. Reef development during the Triassic can thus be explained by the evolutionary spread of photosymbiosis balancing the effects of climatic cooling. 1578:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This study highlights the role of large scale physical perturbations in mediating biotic replacements and shows that an environmental disturbance at the Triassic Jurassic (T J) boundary correlates with abrupt and substantial changes in the composition of brachiopod communities. Disturbance changed the phylogenetic structure of Early Jurassic brachiopod communities owing to a removal of higher taxa that were abundant in the Late Triassic. A replacement of brachiopod communities through the Rhaetian in the Kossen Basin (Northern Calcareous Alps) related to a combination of habitat tracking and immigration local extinction events indicates a high compositional turnover. This turnover is of local nature only because Early Rhaetian communities migrated or tracked their habitats beyond the Kossen Basin and persisted through to the Late Rhaetian in other regions. A siliciclastic interval that is several meters thick with rare brachiopods dated as the earliest Hettangian marks the extinction survival interval. This interval is coeval with a negative carbon isotope anomaly implying a correlation with global perturbation of carbon cycle. A rapid brachiopod recovery is indicated by a presence of several distinct communities in late Early and Middle Hettangian that show onshore offshore differentiation and beta diversity comparable to pre extinction levels. Analyses of similarities demonstrate that (1) the compositional turnover of brachiopod communities on generic level at the T J boundary (R equals 0.83) is substantially higher than turnovers between the Rhaetian zones (R equals 0.28 0.57) and between the Hettangian zones (R equals 0.28 0.53) and (2) the turnover at superfamily level at the T J boundary accounts for differential composition of Rhaetian and Hettangian communities. A global extinction of athyridoid spondylospiroid and dielasmatoid superfamilies characterized by high community level abundances during the Late Triassic led to a new assembly of Jurassic brachiopod communities from surviving superfamilies. In addition to persisting rhynchonellids and zeillerioids Hettangian brachiopod communities were dominated by terebratuloids spiriferinoids and pennospiriferinoids. These superfamilies were characterized in the Late Triassic by low community level abundance. We argue for tracking the phylogenetic structure of communities across mass extinction events because a measurement of the turnover in community level abundance of higher taxa can be highly relevant for estimating the ecologic impact of mass extinctions. Taxonomic extinction rate metrics or diversity measures can be depressed by surviving taxa that do not re attain their pre extinction community level abundance. 1579:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We analysed diversity and abundance patterns of benthic organisms across the Triassic Jurassic (T J) boundary based on the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) which compiles palaeontological collection data on a global scale. While Sepkoskis Sepkoski J.J. Jr. 2002. A compendium of fossil marine animal genera. Bulletins of American Paleontology 363 1 563 compendium on the stratigraphic ranges of marine animal genera suggests that the dominant macrobenthic groups of the Late Triassic experienced significant extinctions prior to the T J boundary a significant end Triassic extinction peak is evident from PBDBs data. This Rhaetian extinction peak is found in both an analysis of the raw data of stratigraphic ranges and a sample standardized analysis of occurrence data; 41 PeRcEnT of all mesobenthic and macrobenthic genera crossing the Norian Rhaetian boundary became extinct within the Rhaetian. Although this rate suffices to characterize the end Triassic extinction as a true mass extinction against a Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic background significantly reduced Rhaetian origination rates add to the strong diversity depletion in the earliest Jurassic. As for other mass extinctions evidence for selective extinction is meagre when the analysis is limited to the boundary interval alone and when focused on taxonomic and ecological characteristics of individual genera. When taxa are separated by environmental preferences however several determinants of extinction risk become evident suggesting that reef dwellers had a significantly higher extinction risk than level bottom dwellers taxa with an inshore preference were more strongly affected than offshore taxa taxa preferring carbonate substrates were more strongly hit than taxa preferring siliciclastic substrates and taxa preferentially inhabiting low latitudes had higher extinction rates than taxa more common at intermediate and high latitudes. Much of this selectivity is not independent and also seen in the intervals of background extinctions suggesting that the end Triassic mass extinction represents an intensification of background extinctions but not a qualitatively different macroevolutionary regime. One possible exception is related to preferences for depositional environments suggesting a selective Rhaetian extinction in reefs and inshore settings. 1580:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The number of cetacean genera varied greatly over their evolutionary history. Cetaceans originated in the Eocene and then rapidly diversified reaching around 30 genera during the Middle Eocene. The number of genera crashed in the late Eocene with only eight described from the early Oligocene. This time also represents the putative extinction of archaeocetes and the origin of Neoceti the clade including extant cetaceans. By the late Oligocene the number of genera recovered and had begun an expansion that peaked in the middle Miocene at over 75 genera. Since that time the number of genera has decreased to around 40 genera extant today. Ideally generic counts reflect the actual number of genera in the past (generic richness) but our understanding of past diversity is confounded by many factors. Generic counts are potentially too high because of the prevalence of genera based on non diagnostic material and taxonomic over splitting. Taxonomic counts can also appear to be too high if the counts are made in time intervals that are excessively long. Conversely generic counts are potentially too low because of fossil non preservation; non deposition destruction or obscured fossil bearing continental shelf rocks; and lack of collecting or publication effort. We evaluate each of these factors as a cause of bias in cetacean diversity. Individual causes may have significant effects on both true generic richness and the amount of bias. These factors must be addressed in any evaluations of past diversity especially for clades represented by an abundance of fossils. 1581:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Arkell and Callomon (1963 pp. 226 232) described a new subgenus of perisphinctid ammonite Aulacostephanus (Xenostephanus) from the Jurassic (Lower Kimmeridgian Mutabilis Standard Chronozone) of Lincolnshire eastern England (drift) and of Scotland (in situ). The type species is A. (X.) ranbyensis; the holotype is from Ranby Lincolnshire. Although initially designated as a subgenus  Ziegler 1962 p. 136; Ziegler 1967 fig. 14 (but also note fig. 15 where it appears to be a genus); Sykes and Surlyk 1976 fig. 7) Xenostephanus Arkell and Callomon has subsequently been elevated to generic rank by many authors  Callomon and Birkelund 1982 table 1; Birkelund . 1983 p. 296; Scotchman 1991 fig. 2; Nagy and Basov 1998 pp. 220 222 text fig. 6; Taylor and Sellwood 2002 p. 99). However the name Xenostephanus had already been used in only the previous year for a new genus of toxodont notoungulate from Mendoza Province western central Argentina. The type species of this genus which was tentatively included in the Oldfieldthomasiidae is Xenostephanus chiottii Simpson . 1962 from the mid Cenozoic (see Cerden__o and Vucetich 2007 for a discussion of changing ideas regarding the age of the Divisadero Largo Formation). It is perhaps unfortunate that Arkell had prepared a provisional albeit unpublished manuscript as early as 1956 but his subsequent illness and eventual death in 1958 conspired to delay publication (Callomon in Arkell and Callomon 1963 p. 219). The authors of these taxa in erecting a generic name that linked a Jurassic ammonite and a toxodont the giant . guinea pig with projecting chisel teeth (Conan Doyle 1913 p. 277) apparently considered the morphology of their respective type species to be strange and crown like which led to the use of the same name (xenos strange stephanos crown Gr.). The homonomy was noted by Van den Hoek Ostende while entering information in the Paleobiology Database. The descriptions of both taxa comply with the requirements of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (1999). Thus Xenostephanus Arkell and Callomon 1963 is a junior homonym of Xenostephanus Simpson . 1962. We therefore propose the name Zenostephanus nom. nov. as a replacement for Xenostephanus Arkell and Callomon 1963 not Simpson . 1962. The new name attempts to preserve the sense of the original by a minor modification of the spelling. The type species of Zenostephanus is Aulacostephanus (Xenostephanus) ranbyensis Arkell and Callomon 1963 by original designation. 1583:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although onshore to offshore retreat of brachiopods in terms of their community level abundance took place through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic this study shows that comparable trends also occurred repeatedly on a short time scale and mainly were driven by variations in sediment and nutrient supply. In the Kossen Formation (Upper Triassic) brachiopods retreated to offshore habitats during nutrient rich siliciclastic regimes and expand to onshore habitats during nutrient poor carbonate regimes. Epifaunal bivalves occupied onshore and offshore habitats during both siliciclastic and carbonate regimes. Infaunal suspension feeding bivalves expanded to offshore habitats during nutrient rich siliciclastic regimes and retreated from offshore habitats during nutrient poor carbonate regimes. Thus the onshore to offshore retreat of brachiopods and the offshore expansion of infaunal bivalves repeatedly coincided with the switch from a nutrient poor carbonate regime to a nutrient rich siliciclastic regime. Because brachiopods and epifaunal bivalves were abundant in micrite rich soft bottom habitats the replacements between infaunal and epifaunal communities cannot be explained by variations in substrate consistency alone. Differences in guild structure between siliciclastic and carbonate regimes and onshore to offshore replacements indicate that distribution of bivalves and brachiopods is related to their differential response to low nutrient supply turbidity and possibly oxygen levels. Based on actualistic evidence brachiopods are able to thrive in nutrient poor conditions due to low metabolic demands and are less tolerant of high turbidity conditions than bivalves. Epifaunal bivalves that co occur with brachiopods in nutrient poor habitats may have been characterized by higher clearance rates in contrast to infaunal bivalves with similar metabolic requirements. Although higher biogenic sediment disturbance or other biotic interactions could play a significant role in the retreat of brachiopods to offshore habitats this study highlights the importance of varying nutrient supply and turbidity in governing onshore to offshore replacements on short time scales. 1584:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Analysis of Middle Triassic data indicates that biogeography influences sample distributions whereas depositional environment and stratigraphic position play secondary roles in governing sample patterns. During this time taxa differed among biogeographic realms while the general ecology remained the same: epifaunal benthos pedunculate and epibyssate suspension feeders dominate Middle Triassic samples much as they did in the Early Triassic. In contrast Late Triassic data prove to be more complex in terms of ecology compared to Middle Triassic. Here guild structure dictates the faunal patterns in addition to biogeographic realm and stratigraphic position and an overall increase of infaunal life habits occurs burrowing suspension and deposit feeders increase. Although diversity after mass extinction began to recover at the Early Middle Triassic boundary our results indicate that ecology remained stable through the Middle Triassic until the more modern life habits  infaunalization) increased in the Late Triassic. We conclude that the taxonomic and ecological differences among Late Triassic geographic regions recorded the initiation of a more mobile and infaunal life habit indicative of a modern lifestyle. Our results also indicate that this modernization did not necessarily unfold simultaneously and in coordinated fashion within regions and throughout time. Instead details of guild expansion or stability may be region specific. 1585:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Cluster analysis reveals eight biofacies during a time of faunal turnover and regional oceanographic change in the middle Upper Ordovician of central Kentucky. These biofacies are arranged along a deep water to shallow water gradient with the dalmanellid and the Sowerbyella biofacies in offshore facies the Rafinesquina the atrypid and the ramose trepostome biofacies in deep subtidal to shallow subtidal facies the Constellaria Cyclonema and the Rhynchotrema biofacies in the shallow subtidal facies and the Solenopora Hebertella biofacies in sand shoal facies. These biofacies are not discrete but rather they share a large number of taxa suggesting that they are arbitrary subdivisions of a depth related ecological gradient. Nonetheless they are useful as a point of comparison with other studies of this time interval in the eastern United States. Previous lower and middle Upper Ordovician biofacies studies portray a similar pattern of plectorthines and rhynchonellaceans in the shallow subtidal strophomenids in the deep subtidal and dalmanellids and plectambonitaceans in the offshore indicating an overall temporal consistency to many of these biofacies at suprageneric taxonomic levels. Similarly values of preferred depth depth tolerance and peak abundance of most taxa are generally conserved and this is particularly true for abundant taxa. Nonetheless this 2 m.y record also indicates temporal changes in the occurrence of some biofacies in the relative abundances of taxa in some biofacies in the species membership within biofacies and in values of preferred depth depth tolerance and peak abundance for several taxa. Collectively these indicate a dynamic aspect to an ecosystem that otherwise displays several attributes of stability and underscore that ecologic stability should not be viewed as a simple dichotomy between stability and instability. The dynamic aspects of this ecosystem suggest that these biofacies were not governed by extreme degrees of species interactions that resulted in near constancy of biofacies structure. Continuous changes in water temperature nutrient supply and turbidity during this time may have been a contributing factor to changes within this ecosystem. 1586:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological studies have revealed that the functional roles of dominant species in modern communities are often more important than overall diversity in governing community composition and functioning. Despite this recognition that abundance and diversity data are both required for a complete understanding of ecological processes many paleoecological studies focus on presence absence data possibly because of concerns regarding the taphonomic fidelity of time averaged fossil accumulations. However the abundance of organisms in shell beds has been shown to provide a fairly accurate record of the living community suggesting that the benefits of relative abundance data should be reconsidered. Recognition of ecologically dominant species in local fossil assemblages should be based on counts of relative abundance and assessment of ecological role. Ecological dominance at larger spatial or temporal scales can be quantified using the mean rank order of a clade and the proportion of assemblages where the clade is present providing unbiased quantitative values for measuring the ecological importance of a clade. Their utility has been tested with three case studies encompassing a range of geographic and taxonomic scales using a database of 1221 Ordovician Paleogene quantitative fossil collections. The dominance metrics for rhynchonelliform brachiopods bivalves and gastropods broadly parallel anecdotal trends even including some more detailed patterns documented by regional studies. An examination of substrate preferences for brachiopod and bivalve orders confirms the abundance of infaunal bivalves in siliciclastics and epifaunal bivalves in carbonates but it also reveals intriguing patterns regarding substrate preferences among rhynchonelliform brachiopod orders. The final case study analyzed changes in dominance between early Mesozoic fossil assemblages from Tethys and Panthalassa documenting significant geographic differences in the ecological importance of rhynchonelliform brachiopods and bivalves. These large scale dominance patterns often approximately matched those inferred from diversity trends; however there are also times when dominance was decoupled from diversity indicating that further investigation of ecological dominance will provide additional insights into ecological influences on the Phanerozoic history of life. 1587:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Images in the monographic literature represent an important but relatively untapped resource for paleontologists. In particular they could provide vast amounts of body size data. It is possible however that images of specimens represent a biased sample of the fossil record. Thus the quality of these data must be assessed before body size estimates from the literature can be used in analyses. Two complementary datasets were constructed for a group of bivalve and brachiopod species from the Paleozoic and the Cenozoic. The monograph dataset consisted of length measurements taken from all unique images of a species in a monograph. The counterpart bulk dataset consisted of comparable measurements taken from a set (n   10) of bulk collected specimens of the same species acquired from the same locality as those figured in the monograph. These paired datasets were used to assess the quality of monographic data. Bias direction and magnitude were assessed by using the bulk sample of a species as an estimate of its underlying size frequency distribution. Bias was estimated for each monographed specimen by calculating its percentile value in relation to the size frequency distribution for that species. All species groups had mean values within the 70th to 85th percentile range indicating a significant bias toward monograph specimens that are larger than the mean of the bulk sample. The consistency of bias was evaluated by comparing the monograph sample mean to the bulk sample mean for each species. When compared in bivariate scatter plots all species groups yielded significant regression lines with slopes near unity indicating highly consistent yet predictable bias in each case. This trend persisted when the data were grouped taxonomically geographically or by year of monograph publication. These results indicate that size measurements of monographed specimens of bivalves and brachiopods consistently record similar size classes for most species. This bias is easy to remove and doing so renders size data from images in monographs useful for macro evolutionary studies of body size. 1588:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Linking biotic patterns across spatiotemporal scales provides a greater understanding of the processes that drive ecological and evolutionary change. Here we examine how global patterns of biotic turnover are expressed in the structure of regional biotic gradients from the Illinois Basin (USA) during the late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) an interval noted for low global rates of taxonomic turnover. Results indicate that the pre LPIA interval is characterized by well defined biotic gradients; depositional environments are dominated by distinct sets of taxa arrayed along a gradient of substrate composition and are clearly differentiated by ordination and ANOSIM analyses. There is a marked shift in gradient structure across the onset of the LPIA environments become weakly distinguished are dominated by similar sets of taxa that are widespread across the ramp and are arrayed along a nearshore offshore gradient. Our results are consistent with findings from global level studies which indicate that broadly adapted taxa (eurytopes) increased in importance following the start of the LPIA. Unlike the global level however the regional increase in eurytopy is not linked to the extinction of narrowly adapted taxa in response to climate change. Instead eurytopy increased as the geometry of the Illinois Basin shifted from a flat carbonate ramp composed of shallower water and higher stress environments in the pre LPIA interval to a steeper ramp comprising deeper water and more stable habitats in the LPIA interval. We suggest that increased eurytopy drove (1) a previously documented decrease in regional level turnover during the late Paleozoic and (2) a perceived pattern of greater persistence in late versus early Paieozoic biotic gradients. 1589:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most research regarding ecological response to extinction in the fossil record focuses on qualitative taxonomically based analyses. Shifting to quantitative analyses that incorporate paleocommunity level data offers a richer ecological perspective on how paleocommunities respond to extinction. During the Late Ordovician (Mohawkian) a regional extinction occurred among marine taxa in the Appalachian Basin of eastern North America. To examine community level paleoecological change across this extinction boundary field censusing of macroinvertebrate genera was completed for the Nashville Dome of Tennessee the Jessamine Dome of central Kentucky and the Valley and Ridge area of western Virginia. In each region shallow and deep subtidal environments were sampled in four stratigraphic sequences representing preextinction and postextinction intervals (M3 and M4 sequences and M5 and M6 sequences respectively). Diversity metrics calculated from subsampled field data generally decrease across the extinction boundary and into the M6 sequence with more significant declines in the deep subtidal facies and Virginia samples. These facies and regional differences in diversity reflect environmental and geographic variability not only in the effects of the extinction but also in the extent of immigration of new taxa to different areas of the basin. Despite diversity declines evenness varies little among sequences facies and regions across the extinction boundary suggesting no major change to the relative abundance structure of paleocommunities. Analyses of shifts in ecospace use (particularly tiering and motility of taxa) and multivariate ordination however also reveal strong environmental and geographic differences in ecological response due to changes in rank abundance of common taxa. 1590:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent studies have emphasized that faunal change is typically brief and most commonly occurs at sequence boundaries and major flooding surfaces. The Upper Ordovician of the Cincinnati Ohio region records a major biotic invasion in the Richmondian Stage which offers an opportunity to test these generalizations and to understand how episodes of faunal change are reflected in the structure of ecological gradients. The early Cincinnatian (C1 early C4 depositional sequences) displays two relatively stable faunal gradients with the primary gradient reflecting onshore offshore setting and the secondary gradient reflecting substrate consistency. During the mid C4 sequence dominant taxa of the shallow subtidal are extirpated while deep subtidal taxa expand into those habitats leading to a loss of cross shelf faunal differentiation. This faunal breakdown is accompanied into the mid C5 by a series of ecological epiboles indicating an ongoing flux in ecological associations. The onshore offshore gradient is reestablished in the C5 albeit with new associations dominated by or containing immigrant taxa. Recognition of this gradient is hindered by widespread increased abundance of bryozoans and by the delayed appearance of at least seven common genera of brachio pods and corals. The Richmondian Invasion plays out over multiple sequences and is not confined to a brief interval at the beginning of a sequence. These faunal changes do not coincide with sequence boundaries or major flooding surfaces and therefore cannot be sequence stratigraphic artifacts nor can they represent a geologically instantaneous faunal response to sea level change. 1591:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Storm generated event beds are an important source of paleoecological information especially in Paleozoic strata. Storm deposition and subsequent physical and biological modification can potentially alter the diversity structure of death assemblages significantly. To examine the effects of storm deposition on fossil assemblage composition storm beds are compared with co occurring beds representing background sedimentation in 67 samples from six Ordovician mixed carbonate elastic units deposited above the maximum storm wave base. In the great majority of pairwise comparisons evenness and sampled richness are higher in storm beds than in background beds. This effect is not explained by differences in lithification skeletal fragmentation or in the proportions of aragonitic or multielement skeletons. The elevated diversity of storm beds can result from homogenization of fine scale faunal patchiness preserved in background beds or may be due to taphonomic feedback. The relative importance of these two end member scenarios can be evaluated with detrended correspondence analysis. In shallow carbonate dominated environments the former appears to predominate while the latter is more important in a deeper setting dominated by fine grained clastics. The disparity between background beds and storm beds suggests that at least in the Lower Paleozoic background beds may record a higher resolution paleoecological signal while storm beds record a more complete census of alpha diversity. Because post Middle Ordovician increases in the depth and intensity of bioturbation may have diminished the temporal resolution and increase the faunal completeness of background beds this disparity is not necessarily expected in younger strata. 1592:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The oldest known Jurassic coral reef is exposed in the Ardeche region of southern France. This reef site consisting of at least three reefal bodies is of early Hettangian age and thus immediately postdates the end Triassic mass extinction which is well known for its catastrophic effect on reef building. Bulk carbonate carbon isotopes of the limestones below the reef are likely to record environmental perturbations subsequent to the mass extinction. The main reef is surprisingly well developed (20 m in thickness 200 m in lateral extent) and composed of at least four genera and six species of corals not only holdover genera from the Triassic but also one newly evolved genus (Phacelophyllia) contributed to reef construction. Just like their latest Triassic counterparts the reef is dominated by phaceloid corals with a considerable contribution of microbialite. The reef predates similarly well developed structures by almost ten million years. The shelf setting of the reef renders it unlikely that refuges around oceanic islands are needed to explain survival of corals across the end Triassic mass extinction. 1593:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Using abundance data this study explores quantitative patterns from marine benthos including implications for paleogeography depositional environment stratigraphic position taxonomic groups (brachiopod or mollusc) substrate preferences and ecological niches. Twenty nine brachiopod and bivalve dominated fossil assemblages from the Pennsylvanian and Early Permian of North and South America Thailand and Australia were analyzed from carbonate platform environments; specifically Nevada Kansas Oklahoma Texas Utah New Mexico Venezuela Kanchanaburi (Thailand) and Queensland (Australia). Samples were categorized by paleogeographic location depositional environment and age to help differentiate factors controlling the faunal patterns. Pooled from primary and summary literature resources 336 321 specimens were identified to genus level and classified in terms of taxonomic membership substrate preference and ecological niche. Data were analyzed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and multi response permutation procedure cross validated a priori categories  paleogeography depositional environment stratigraphic position and specimen ecology). Multivariate analyses indicate that the separation between genera and the orthogonal trends implies that paleoecological patterns within the studied late Paleozoic faunal associations were influenced strongly by the abundance of sessile versus mobile faunal components. 1595:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Unfossiliferous marine sedimentary rocks of Phanerozoic age are known to all field oriented paleontologists. These troublesome units are often encountered in the field perhaps cursed roundly for a moment or two and usually shrugged off in pursuit of the next fossiliferous interval. Paleontologists tend not to discuss barren units and they rarely publish on the absence of a fauna from what appears to be unaltered marine rock. But arent barren marine sediments revealing something important about their paleoenvironment and possibly about the paleoenvironments of conformably adjacent fossil bearing units? Shouldn t paleontologists be just as interested in knowing the locations and ages of unfossiliferous sediments as they are fossiliferous strata? In this essay I discuss the possible environmental significance of barren marine sediment and present preliminary data to suggest that its frequency may have varied considerably during the Phanerozoic. I also present evidence to suggest that this variation is associated with shifts in the prevailing location of preserved marine sediment accumulation from expansive epicontinental seas to comparatively narrow continental shelves. Finally I propose that such shifts in the physiographic contexts of marine shelf habitats and their preserved sediments are associated with oceanographic effects that have greatly influenced environmental and biological evolution the character of the fossil record and our perception of marine biodiversity and macroevolution at many different temporal and spatial scales.  1596:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, For decades paleobiologists have treated global diversity estimation as a straightforward problem: count up the known higher taxa in each geological time interval make a diversity curve and go straight ahead to analyzing and interpreting the trends. However global diversity curves recently have come under attack from all sides. Some researchers argue that although traditional curves are strongly affected by sampling biases these biases can be corrected by assembling large locality level databases with detailed contextual information. Others point to the large gap between true total global richness and the meager head counts the fossil record has to offer and conclude that workers should focus exclusively on local and regional diversity. Here I argue that although further fieldwork surely is needed understanding global diversity in the short term remains a tractable goal__as long as we move quickly to build a discipline wide globally extensive paleontological database. 1597:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Regardless of the macroevolutionary issues at stake most students of biodiversity would agree that there is value in calibrating global biodiversity trends through critical intervals. To cite one obvious example given the overwhelming interest in mass extinctions we would certainly like to know the extent to which diversity declined during these events. Just as significantly if we are to argue that any mass extinction was truly a global phenomenon we must demonstrate definitively that its biotic effects reached around the world. Clearly standard global compendia are insufficient for the latter objective because they contain no geographic or environmental information. At the least a database that compares biodiversity transitions among different regions or paleoenvironments is required. Such analyses have the added benefit of providing opportunities to evaluate geographic and environmental selectivity in extinctions an important facet of any attempt to understand what caused them. However beyond the desire to assess mass extinctions and other globally mediated biotic events does an accurate read of global diversity through a given stratigraphic interval really tell us anything that we could not learn about macroevolutionary processes simply by focusing on one or a fewwell studied regions? After several decades of intense investigation this question remains contentious. Even among the four authors who reached a landmark consensus about the trajectory of Phanerozoic global diversity there was no consensus about what produced the pattern. On the one hand Bambach suggested that Phanerozoic trends in median species richness within communities (a proxy for alpha diversity) paralleled trends exhibited in aggregate global compilations of taxonomic richness. Further in evaluating the ecological propensities of Sepkoskis three evolutionary faunas Bambach argued that increases in the level of global diversity achieved by successive faunas were tied directly to increases in ecospace utilization a property that should be observable at the local level (see Aronson 1994 and Miller 2000 for other examples of possible scale independence in long term biodiversity trends). On the other hand Valentine suggested that there was an intimate relationship between the major post Paleozoic global marine diversity increase and a secular increase in the number of distinct faunal provinces. If Valentine is correct then we cannot hope to capture this important aspect of diversification by limiting our purview to one or a few regions. If Valentine is wrong there are nevertheless strong indications that long term diversity trends differed significantly among major regions around the world. Moreover even if a consistent diversity trend is observed from region to region at the alpha level this is no guarantee that we will observe the same overall pattern at the beta level (the degree of differentiation between communities) or higher. This decoupling of diversification at different hierarchical levels whatever the cause argues strongly for the existence of some set of evolutionary or ecological processes confined to limited hierarchical scales. It should be clear from the foregoing that to determine what drives diversity at any scale we must understand the similarities and differences in biodiversity trends among the major regions  paleocontinents) that constitute the world at any point in time. Limiting our analyses to just one or two regions simply will not suffice. This was illustrated cogently by Rosenzweig and McCords classic analysis of the global replacement of turtles with inflexible necks by turtles with retractable flexible necks. The fact that the transition was observed in several separate regions but at different times lends strong credence to the argument that the transition was not a random one and that advent of a flexible neck was a key adaptation for the group. Without the regional comparison at the heart of this analysis this definitive conclusion would not have been possible.  1598:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A growing body of work has quantitatively linked many macroevolutionary patterns including short and long term changes in biodiversity rates of taxonomic extinction and origination and patterns of extinction selectivity to temporal variability in the sedimentary rock record. Here we establish a new framework for more rigorously testing alternative hypotheses for these and many other results by documenting the large scale spatiotemporal intersection of the North American sedimentary rock and fossil records. To do this we combined 30 387 fossil collections in the spatially explicit Paleobiology Database with a comprehensive macrostratigraphic database consisting of 18 815 sedimentary lithostratigraphic units compiled from 814 geographic regions distributed across the United States and Canada. The geological completeness of paleontological sampling here defined as the proportion of the available sedimentary rock record that has been documented to have at least one fossil occurrence irrespective of taxonomy or environment is measured at four different levels of stratigraphic resolution: (1) lithostratigraphic rock units (2) hiatus bound rock packages (3) regional stratigraphic columns and (4) sediment coverage area (km(2)). Mean completeness estimates for 86 Phanerozoic time intervals (approximately stages; median duration 5.3 Myr) range from 0.18 per interval in the case of lithostratigraphic rock units to 0.23 per interval for stratigraphic columns and sediment coverage area. Completeness estimates at all four levels of stratigraphic resolution exhibit similar temporal variation including a significant long term increase during the Phanerozoic that is accentuated by an abrupt Campanian Maastrichtian peak. This Late Cretaceous peak in completeness is approximately five times greater than the least complete Phanerozoic time intervals (Early Cambrian Early Devonian late Permian and Early Cretaceous). Geological completeness in the Cenozoic is on average approximately 40 PeRcEnT greater than in the Paleozoic. Temporal patterns of geological completeness do not appear to be controlled exclusively by variation in the frequency of subsurface rock units or an increase over time in the proportion of terrestrial rock but instead may be general features of both the marine and terrestrial fossil records. 1599:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Abundance is one of the primary factors believed to influence extinction yet little is known about its relationship to extinction rates over geologic time. Using data from the Paleobiology Database we show that abundance was an important factor in the extinction dynamics of marine bivalve genera over the post Paleozoic. Contrary to expectations Our analyses reveal a nonlinear relationship between abundance and extinction rates with rare and abundant genera exhibiting rates elevated over those of genera of moderate abundance. This U shaped pattern is a persistent feature of the post Paleozoic history of marine bivalves and provides one possible explanation for why we find strong support for heterogeneous extinction rates among genera grouped by similarity in abundance yet effectively no not relationship among these rates when using models of directional selection on abundance. 1600:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Apparent variation in rates of origination and extinction reflects the true temporal pattern of taxonomic rates as well as the distorting effects of incomplete and variable preservation effects that are themselves exacerbated by true variation in taxonomic rates. Here I present on approach that can undo these distortions and thus permit estimates of true taxonomic rates while providing estimates of preservation in the process Standard survivorship probability art modified to incorporate variable taxonomic rates and rates of fossil recovery Time series Of these rates are explored by numerical optimization until the set of rates that best explains the observed data is found. If internal occurrences within stratigraphic ranges are available or if temporal pattern of fossil recovery can otherwise be assumed these constraints can be exploited but they are by it() means necessary. In its most general form the approach requires tit) data Other than first and last appearances. When tested against simulated data the method is able to recovery temporal patterns in rates of origination extinction and preservation. With empirical data it yields estimates Of preservation rate that agree with those obtained independently by tabulating internal occurrences within stratigraphic ranges. Moreover when empirical occurrence data are artificially degraded the method detects the resulting gaps in sampling and corrects taxonomic rates Preliminary application to data on Pateozoic marine animals suggests that Some features of the apparent record such as the forward smearing of true origination events and the backward smearing of true extinction events can be detected and corrected. Other features such a the end Ordovician extinction may be fairly accurate at face value. 1601:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Because of the fragmentary preservation of the earliest Cooksonia like terrestrial plant macrofossils younger Devonian fossils with complete anatomical preservation and documented gametophytes often have received greater attention concerning the early evolution of vascular plants and the alternation of generations. Despite preservational deficits however possible physiologies of Cooksonia like fossils can be constrained by considering the overall axis size in conjunction with the potential range of cell types and sizes because their lack of organ differentiation requires that all plant functions be performed by the same axis. Once desiccation resistance support and transport functions are taken into account smaller fossils do not have volume enough left over for an extensive aerated photosynthetic tissue thus arguing for physiological dependence on an unpreserved gametophyte. As in many mosses axial anatomy is more likely to have ensured continued spore dispersal despite desiccation of the sporophyte than to have provided photosynthetic independence. Suppositions concerning size constraints on physiology are supported by size comparisons with fossils of demonstrable physiological independence by preserved anatomical detail and by size correlations between axis sporangia and sporangial stalk in Silurian and Early Devonian taxa. Several Cooksonia like taxa lump fossils with axial widths spanning over an order of magnitude from necessary physiological dependence to potential photosynthetic competence informing understanding of the evolution of an independent sporophyte and the phylogenetic relationships of early vascular plants. 1602:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biodiversity patterns in the fossil record are often interpreted as functions of only origination and extinction whereas the migration of taxa among regions or paleocontinents is rarely considered. A null biogeographic model is presented that evaluates the role of migration in shaping global biodiversity patterns across evolutionary time scales. As taxa are allowed to originate go extinct and migrate among continents the model keeps track of global richness and differentiation diversity (the diversity gained by pooling continents). The models results highlight the difference between global scale and continental scale origination and extinction rates. Intuitively origination and extinction have opposite effects on global richness at the global scale but they interact with migration at the continental scale to influence differentiation diversity and global richness in surprising ways. The model shows that the migration of taxa among paleocontinents can facilitate an increase in global richness even when continental extinction is greater than continental origination. Additionally the model shows that differentiation diversity reaches a dynamic equilibrium that is dictated by the combination of migration origination and extinction rates. A test of the model with Ordovician macroinvertebrate data indicates that migration rates were low during the Ordovician and that differentiation diversity was high and varied little. Overall the Ordovician was an interval of high provinciality. It also shown that widespread genera were less prone to global extinction even though extinction of genera on individual paleocontinents was common. 1603:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological veracity of the sharp diversity increase observed in many analyses of the post Paleozoic marine fossil record has been debated vigorously in recent years. To assess this question for sample level (  alpha  ) diversity we used bulk samples of shelly invertebrates representing three major fossil groups (brachiopods bivalves and gastropods) to compare the Jurassic and late Cenozoic sample level diversity of marine benthos. After restricting the data set to single bed whole fauna bulk samples (n   30 specimens) from comparable open marine siliciclastic facies we were able to retain 427 samples (255 Jurassic and 172 late Cenozoic) with most of those samples originating from our own empirical work. Regardless of the diversity metric applied the initial results suggest that standardized sample level species (or genus) diversity driven by evenness and or richness of the most common taxa increased between the Jurassic and late Cenozoic by at least a factor of 1.6. When the data are partitioned into the three dominant higher taxa it becomes clear that (1) the bivalves which dominated the samples for both time intervals increased in sample level diversity between the Jurassic and the late Cenozoic by a much smaller factor than the total fauna; (2) the removal of brachiopods which were a noticeable component of the Jurassic samples did not significantly affect standardized sample level diversity estimates; and (3) the gastropods which were rare in the Jurassic but common in many late Cenozoic samples contributed notably to the increase in sample level diversity observed between the two time intervals. Parallel to these changes the samples revealed secular trends in ecological structure including Jurassic to late Cenozoic increases in proportion of (1) infauna (2) mobile forms and (3) non suspension feeding organisms. These trends mostly persist when data are restricted to bivalves. Supplementary analyses indicate that these patterns cannot be attributed to sampling heterogeneities in paleolatitudinal range lithology or paleoenvironment of deposition. Likewise when data are restricted to samples dominated by species with originally aragonitic shells the observed temporal changes persist at a comparable magnitude suggesting that the pervasive loss of aragonite in the older fossil record is unlikely to have been the primary cause of the observed patterns. The comparable ratio of identified to unidentified species and genera observed when comparing the Jurassic and late Cenozoic samples indicates that the relatively poorer (mold cast) preservation of Jurassic aragonite species also is unlikely to have been responsible for the observed patterns. However the diagenesis related taphonomic and methodological artifacts cannot be ruled out as an at least partial contributor to the observed post Paleozoic changes in diversity taxonomic composition and ecology (the outcomes of the three tests of the diagenetic bias available to us are incongruent). The study demonstrates that the post Paleozoic trends in the sample level diversity ecology and taxonomic structure of common taxa can be replicated across multiple studies. However the diversity increase estimated here is much less prominent than suggested by many previous analyses. The results also narrow the list of causative explanations down to two testable hypotheses. The first is diagenetic bias a spurious trend driven by either (a) increasing taphonomic loss of small specimens in the older fossil record or (b) a shift in sampling procedures between predominantly lithified rocks of the Mesozoic and predominately unlithified and therefore sievable sediments of the late Cenozoic. The second hypothesis is genuine biological changes macroevolutionary trends in the structure of marine benthic associations through time consistent with predictions of several related models such as evolutionary escalation increased ecospace utilization and the Mesozoic marine revolution. Future studies should focus on testing these two rival models a key remaining challenge for identifying the primary causative mechanism for the long term changes in sample level diversity ecology and taxonomic structure observed in the Phanerozoic marine fossil record. 1604:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biotic invasions are a common feature of the fossil record yet remarkably little is known about them given their enormous potential to reveal the processes that regulate local and regional diversity over long time scales. We used additive diversity partiticming to examine how diversity structure changed as a result of a marine biotic invasion in tropical shallow and deep subtidal environments spanning approximately 4 Myr in the Late Ordovician. The biotic invasion increased richness in the regional ecosystem by nearly 40 PeRcEnT. Within habitat turnover diversity accounts for most of the increase in richness with between habitat turnover diversity contributing a lesser amount. Increases in these components of diversity were accommodated by increased packing of species along a depth gradient and increased habitat heterogeneity. Diversity metrics that incorporate taxon abundance (Shannon information Simpsons D) show similar patterns and reveal that many invading taxa were locally abundant and widespread in their occurrence. Extinction of incumbent taxa did not foster the invasion; rather the invasion appears to be linked to a regional or global warming event. Taken together these observations indicate that these Late Ordovician marine communities were open to invasion and not saturated with species. Moreover the increase in species diversity caused by the invasion was not ephemeral; instead it lasted for at least 1 Myr. Similar studies of other biotic invasions in the fossil record are necessary to determine (1) the factors such as extinction of incumbents or resource limitation that may facilitate or inhibit invasion in ancient ecosystems; (2) how local and regional ecosystems respond to invasion; and (3) the extent to which biotic invasions play a substantial role in ecosystem change through geologic time. 1605:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Distinguishing the differential roles of liardpart input rates and burial rates in the formation of shell beds is important in paleobiologic and sedimentologic studies because high shelliness can reflect either high population density of shell producers or lack of sediment. The modeling in this paper shows that differences in the relative importance of burial rates and hardpart input rates lead to distinct patterns with respect to the degree of shelliness and taphonomic alteration in shell beds. Our approach substantially complements other models because it allows computation of both shelliness and assemblage level alteration. To estimate shelliness we dissected hardpart input rates into dead shell production and shell destruction rates. To estimate assemblage level alteration we computed an alteration rate that describes how rapidly shells accrue postmortem damage. Under decreasing burial rates but constant hardpart input rates a positive correlation between alteration and shelliness is expected (Kidwells R sediment model). In contrast under decreased destruction rates and or increased dead shell production rates and constant burial rates (Kidwells R hardpart model) a negative correlation between shelliness and alteration is expected. The contrasting predictions thus provide a theoretical basis for distinguishing whether high shell density in shell beds reflects passive shell accumulation due to a lack of sediment dilution or whether it instead reflects high shell input from a life assemblage. This approach should be applicable for any fossil assemblages that vary in shell density and assemblage level alteration. An example from the Lower Jurassic of Morocco which has shell rich samples less altered than shell poor samples suggests that the higher shelliness correlates with higher community level abundance and lower proportion of juveniles of the main shell producer supporting the driving role of hardpart input rates in the origin of the shell rich samples in this case. This is of significance in paleoecologic analyses because variations in shelliness can directly reflect fluctuations in population density of shell producers. 1606:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, During the Ordovician Radiation domination of benthic marine communities shifted away from trilobites toward articulate brachiopods and to a lesser degree toward bivalves and gastropods. In this paper we identify the patterns in origination and extinction probabilities that gave rise to these transitions. Using methods adapted from capture mark recapture (CMR) population studies we estimate origination extinction and sampling probabilities jointly to avoid confounding patterns in turnover rates with temporal variation in the quality of the fossil record. Not surprisingly higher extinction probabilities in trilobites relative to articulate brachiopods bivalves and gastropods were partly responsible for relative decreases in. trilobite diversity. However articulate brachiopods also had higher origination probabilities than trilobites indicating that relative increases in articulate brachiopod diversity would have occurred even in the absence of between class differences in extinction probabilities. This contrasts with inferences based on earlier Phanerozoic scale long term averages of turnover probabilities and it indicates that a major cause of this faunal transition has been overlooked. 1607:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, During the Ordovician Radiation domination of benthic marine communities shifted away from trilobites toward articulated brachiopods and to a lesser degree toward bivalves and gastropods. Here models are formulated that mathematically represent alternative hypothesized causes of this transition. These include models in which per genus origination or extinction probabilities were constrained to be (1) constant (2) diversity dependent (3) productivity dependent or (4) jointly dependent on productivity and diversity. Using a method adapted from capturemark recapture (CMR) population studies we estimate origination extinction and sampling probabilities jointly in order to avoid confounding patterns in turnover probabilities with temporal variation in the quality of the fossil record. Using Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC) we assessed the fit of the alternative causal models relative to one another and relative to a noncausal   phenomenological   alternative that placed no constraints on the pattern of temporal variation in origination or extinction. There were differences among taxa in the relative fit of these models suggesting that the effects of productivity and diversity varied among higher taxa. In the aggregate however there was strong support for diversity dependent origination. For extinction poor fit of the alternative causal models suggests that we lack a good explanation for extinction patterns. These analyses support the hypothesis that diversity dependent origination particularly in trilobites contributed to the Ordovician faunal transitions. By contrast the effects of increased productivity if indeed they were large enough to influence global diversification patterns did not proceed in the hypothesized manner. 1608:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecology is thought to be of crucial importance in determining taxonomic turnover at geological time scales yet general links between ecology and biodiversity dynamics are still poorly explored in deep time. Here we analyze the relationships between the environmental affinities of Triassic Jurassic marine benthic genera and their biodiversity dynamics using a large taxonomically vetted data set of Triassic Jurassic taxonomic occurrences. On the basis of binomial probabilities of proportional occurrence counts we identify environmental affinities of genera for (1) carbonate versus siliciclastic substrates (2) onshore versus offshore depositional environments (3) reefs versus level bottom communities and (4) tropical versus non tropical latitudinal zones. Genera with affinities for carbonates onshore environments and reefs have higher turnover rates than genera with affinities for siliciclastic offshore and level bottom settings. Differences in faunal turnover are largely due to differences in origination rates. Whereas previous studies have highlighted the direct influence of physical and biological factors in exploring environmental controls on evolutionary rates our analyses show that the patterns can largely be explained by the partitioning of higher taxa with different evolutionary tempos among environments. The relatively slowly evolving bivalves are concentrated in siliciclastic rocks and in level bottom communities. Furthermore separate analyses on bivalves did not produce significant differences in turnover rates between environmental settings. The relationship between biodiversity dynamics and environments in our data set is thus governed by the partitioning of higher taxa within environmental categories and not directly due to greater chances of origination in particular settings. As this partitioning probably has ecological reasons rather than being a simple sampling artifact we propose an indirect environmental control on evolutionary rates. Affinities for latitudinal zones are not linked to systematically different turnover rates possibly because of paleoclimatic fluctuations and latitudinal migrations of taxa. However the strong extinction spike of tropical genera in the Rhaetian calls for an important paleoclimatic component in the end Triassic mass extinction. 1609:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Evaluating the relative importance of biotic versus abiotic factors in governing macroevolutionary patterns is a central question of palecibiology. Here we analyzed patterns of changes in global relative abundances and diversity of ecological groups to infer the role of biological interactions as driving evolutionary forces in mid Mesozoic macrobenthic marine ecosystems. Specifically we tested the hypothesis of escalation which states that macroevolutionary patterns were controlled by an increasing pressure exerted by enemies on their victims. Associated with evidence of increasing levels of predation and biogenic sediment reworking (bulldozing) is ail increasing representation of predation and disturbance resistant groups in the fossil record. In particular we observe increasing proportions of mobile organisms; a decline of vulnerable epifauna living freely on the substrate; and a trend toward infaunalization of the benthos. These trends were most pronounced in the paleotropics the region where biological activity is thought to have been highest. The observation that these changes affected several biotic traits and occurred within independent clades argues against the overriding role of a single key adaptive innovation in causing shifts in ecological abundance. Also changes in the abiotic environment cannot explain these faunal patterns because of lacking cross correlations with physico chemical parameters Such as global sea level climate and seawater chemistry. We conclude that in marine benthic ecosystems of the mid Mesozoic enemy driven evolution or escalation was a plausible and important factor. 1610:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Extinction risk is inversely related to genus age (time since first appearance) in most intervals of the Phanerozoic marine fossil record in apparent contradiction to the macroevolutionary Red Queens Hypothesis which posits that extinction risk is independent of taxon age. Agedependent increases in the mean species richness and geographic range of genera have been invoked to reconcile this genus level observation with the presumed prevalence of Red Queen dynamics at the species level. Here we test these explanations with data from the Paleobiology Database. Multiple logistic regression demonstrates that the association of extinction risk with genus age is not adequately explained by species richness or geographic range: there is a residual association between age and extinction risk even when range and richness effects are accounted for. Throughout most of the Phanerozoic the age selectivity gradient is highest among the youngest age cohorts whereas there is no association between age and extinction risk among older age cohorts. Some of the apparent age selectivity of extinction in the global fauna is attributable to differences in extinction rate among taxonomic groups but extinction risk declines with genus age even within most taxonomic orders. Notable exceptions to this pattern include the Cambrian Ordovician latest Permian Triassic and Paleocene intervals. The association of age with extinction risk could reflect sampling heterogeneity or taxonomic practice more than biological reality but at present it is difficult to evaluate or correct for such biases. Alternatively the pattern may reflect consistent extinction selectivity on some as yet unidentified covariate of genus age. Although this latter explanation is not compatible with a Red Queen model if most genus extinctions have resulted from biological interactions it may be applicable if most genus extinctions have instead been caused by recurrent physical disturbances that repeatedly impose similar selective pressures. 1611:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fossil marine lineages are generally expected to exhibit long term trends of increasing body size because of inherent fitness advantages or secular changes in environmental conditions. Because empirical documentation of this trend during the Paleozoic has been lacking for most taxonomic groups the magnitude timing and taxonomic breadth of the trend have remained elusive. This study uses the largest existing database of fossil invertebrate sizes from four faunally important phyla to document ecosystem wide size trends in well preserved biotas from deep subtidal soft substrate assemblages during the Cambrian through Devonian. Size of type specimens was measured along standard body axes from monographic plates and converted to body volume by using a broadly applicable empirical regression. Results demonstrate that mean body size (herein volume) of individual genera doubles during this interval especially from the Late Ordovician through Early Devonian. The timing is gradual in spite of major radiations and extinctions and the increase is primarily attributable to a net increase in the three dimensionality of genera. The overall increase is not caused by replacement among clades because increases are widespread among arthropods brachiopods and echinoderms at the phylum and class levels; in contrast mollusks do not display a net size change at either taxonomic level. The increase is also more pronounced in microbivores than in carnivores. Combined with known environmental changes during this interval and especially records of carbon dioxide these trends provide support for the claim that primary productivity increased during the early to mid Paleozoic. 1612:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Geographic range and taxonomic duration are known to be positively correlated in a number of biologic groups; this is usually attributed to the influence of range upon duration rather than the other way about. Here we analyze two distinct components of this correlation within species and genera of marine invertebrates and microfossils by partitioning the total duration into two parts: the time it takes a taxon to attain its maximum geographic range and the time a taxon persists after attaining its peak range. We find that the longer it takes a taxon to attain its maximum geographic range the wider is that range. We also find that the broader the maximum range the greater is the duration after this maximum is attained. These two correlations are equally strong on average. There is thus a reciprocal relationship between duration and geographic range and there is no compelling evidence that range generally determines duration more or less than duration determines range. 1613:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, If last appearances of marine animal genera are taken as reasonable proxies for true extinctions then there is appreciable global extinction in every stage of the Phanerozoic. If instead backsmearing of extinctions by incomplete sampling is explicitly taken into consideration a different view of extinction emerges in which the pattern of extinction is much more volatile and in which quiescent time spans with little or no global extinction for several million years are punctuated by major extinction events that are even more extreme than is generally thought. Independent support for this alternative view comes from analysis of genus occurrence data in the Paleobiology Database which agrees with previous estimates of sampling probability and implies that offsets between extinction and last appearance of one or more stages are quite probable. 1615:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Major shifts in ecological dominance are one of the most conspicuous but poorly understood features of the fossil record. Here we examine one of the most prominent such shifts the Ordovician shift from trilobite to brachiopod dominance of benthic ecosystems. Using an integrated database of high resolution paleoecological samples and body size data we show that while the average local richness and relative abundance of trilobites declined significantly through the Ordovician the estimated standing biomass of trilobites and by implication the amount of energy that they used remained relatively invariant. This is attributable to an increase in the average body size of trilobite species in our data set and especially to the widespread occurrence of the exceptionally large Middle Late Ordovician trilobite genus Isotelus. Brachiopods increase in both mean body size and relative abundance throughout the Ordovician so that estimates of brachiopod biomass and energetic use increase substantially between the Early and Late Ordovician. Although the data set includes a range of depositional environments similar trends are observed in both shallow subtidal and deep subtidal settings. These results suggest that diversification of the Paleozoic Fauna did not come at the energetic expense of the Cambrian Fauna. The declining relative abundance of trilobites may reflect a combination of numerical dilution and the necessary energetic trade offs between body size and abundance. 1616:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database are used to analyze the waxing and waning of genera over time. Irrespective of whether we tabulate species richness frequency of occurrence geographic range or other measures the average rise and fall of genera is remarkably symmetrical. Genera tend already to be in a state of decline when they become extinct. Genera that last appear in the major mass extinction stages however are more frequently truncated while they are holding steady or even increasing. This need not imply that mass extinctions are qualitatively different from other events; it is consistent with the expected effects of simply increasing the magnitude of extinction. For reasons that are not completely clear post Paleozoic genera show less of a rise and fall on average and tend to be less symmetrical than do Paleozoic genera. 1617:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phanerozoic trends in shell and life habit traits linked to postmortem durability were evaluated for the most common fossil brachiopod gastropod and bivalve genera in order to test for changes in taphonomic bias. Using the Paleobiology Database we tabulated occurrence frequencies of genera for 48 intervals of similar to 11 Myr duration. The most frequently occurring genera cumulatively representing 40 PeRcEnT of occurrences in each time bin were scored for intrinsic durability on the basis of shell size reinforcement (ribs folds and spines) life habit and mineralogy. Shell durability is positively correlated with the number of genera in a time bin but durability traits exhibit different temporal patterns across higher taxa with notable offsets in the timing of changes in these traits. We find no evidence for temporal decreases in durability that would indicate taphonomic bias at the Phanerozoic scale among commonly occurring genera. Also all three groups show a remarkable stability in mean shell size through the Phanerozoic an unlikely pattern if strong size filtering taphonomic megabiases were affecting the fossil record of shelly faunas. Moreover small shell sizes are attained in the early Paleozoic in brachiopods and in the latest Paleozoic in gastropods but are steady in bivalves; unreinforced shells are common to all groups across the entire Phanerozoic; organophosphatic and aragonitic shells dominate only the oldest and youngest time bins; and microstructures having high organic content are most common in the oldest time bins. In most cases the timing of changes in durability related traits is inconsistent with a late Mesozoic Marine Revolution. The post Paleozoic increase in mean gastropod reinforcement occurs in the early Triassic suggesting either an earlier appearance and expansion of durophagous predators or other drivers. Increases in shell durability hypothesized to be the result of increased predation in the late Mesozoic are not evident in the common genera examined here. Infaunal life habit does increase in the late Mesozoic but it does not become more common than levels already attained during the Paleozoic and only among bivalves does the elevated late Mesozoic level persist through the Holocene. These temporal patterns suggest control on the occurrence of durability related traits by individual evolutionary histories rather than taphonomic megabiases. Our findings do not mean taphonomic biases are absent from the fossil record but rather that their effects apparently have had little net effect on the relative occurrence of shell traits generally thought to confer higher preservation potential over long time scales. 1618:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Previous analyses of the history of Phanerozoic marine biodiversity suggested that the post Paleozoic increase observed at the family level and below was caused in part by an increase in global provinciality associated with the breakup of Pangea. Efforts to characterize the Phanerozoic history of provinciality however have been compromised by interval to interval variations in the methods and standards used by researchers to calibrate the number of provinces. With the development of comprehensive occurrence based data repositories such as the Paleobiology Database (PaleoDB) it is now possible to analyze directly the degree of global compositional disparity as a function of geographic distance (geo disparity) and changes thereof throughout the history of marine animal life. Here we present a protocol for assessing the Phanerozoic history of geo disparity and we apply it to stratigraphic bins arrayed throughout the Phanerozoic for which data were accessed from the PaleoDB. Our analyses provide no indication of a secular Phanerozoic increase in geo disparity. Furthermore fundamental characteristics of geo disparity may have changed from era to era in concert with changes to marine venues although these patterns will require further scrutiny in future investigations. 1619:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent research has corroborated the long held view that the diversity of genera within benthic marine communities has increased from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic as much as three to fourfold after mitigating for such biasing influences as secular variation in time averaging and environmental coverage. However these efforts have not accounted for the considerable increase in the availability of unlithified fossiliferous sediments in strata of late Mesozoic and Cenozoic age. Analyses presented here on the Cenozoic fossil record of New Zealand demonstrate that unlithified sediments not only increase the amount of fossil material and hence the observed diversity therein but they also preserve a pool of taxa that is compositionally distinct from lithified sediments. The implication is that a large component of the difference in estimates of within community diversity between Paleozoic and Cenozoic assemblages may relate to the increased availability of unlithified sediments in the Cenozoic. 1620:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Short term fluctuations in the diversification rate of Paleozoic marine animal genera are more strongly correlated with extinction rate variation than with origination rate variation. Diversity dynamics are strikingly different in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic when variation in origination is more important than extinction. Data on the lithologic context of taxonomic occurrences in the Paleobiology Database are used to assess the substrate affinities of Paleozoic genera. The greater role of extinction rate variation in the Paleozoic is found to characterize genera with an affinity for carbonate substrates but not those that prefer terrigenous clastic substrates. It is therefore plausible that the Paleozoic to post Paleozoic shift in diversity dynamics is underlain in part by the secular decline in the relative areal extent of carbonate environments and the concomitant decline in the relative diversity of carbonate versus clastic loving taxa. 1621:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Since David Raups seminal 1976 work paleontologists have been aware of the relationship between outcrop area and diversity. By incorporating lithologic data derived from Alexander Ronov and coworkers into Our own data on areas of mapped outcrops from worldwide geologic maps we are able to establish a quantitative connection between area of sedimentary rock exposure and diversity from the same general depositional environments. Significant power law relations are observed at both global and continental scales of consideration. The addition of data on areas of habitable area estimated from paleogeographic maps does not Substantially affect these correlations between outcrop area and diversity indicating that the relation between outcrop area and diversity is primarily a function of sampling and not a common cause such as sea level. We observe a significant diversity area effect first noted by Jack Sepkoski in the marine realm. Unlike Sepkoskis however Our diversity area effect appears to play a Substantial role in influencing diversity through time; a true global diversity signal appears to be contained in the rock record despite the impacts of variable sampling. Greater outcrop area can serve to increase estimated diversity by increasing both the sample size and the range of habitats and biogeographic provinces sample. After standardizing for pure sampling intensity by rarefying the number of taxon occurrences outcrop area continues to explain a substantial portion of global marine diversity. This indicates that coverage or sampling from multiple habitats and biogeographic provinces is even more important than sampling intensity. If we remove the effect of outcrop area from our estimate of global biodiversity we do not observe a net increase in diversity toward the present lending Support to other Studies that have not Supported a substantial long term global increase in biodiversity during the Phanerozoic. 1622:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Temporal variation in sampling intensity and geologically controlled rates of fossil preservation distort macroevolutionary patterns in the fossil record. Here we use a comprehensive list based compilation of taxonomically and stratigraphically vetted global crinoid genus occurrences to evaluate and correct for the effects of variable and incomplete sampling from the Ordovician through Early Silurian. After standardizing the number of occurrences or the number of biofacies used to estimate the stratigraphic ranges of genera and after adjusting rates of turnover to account for the incomplete preservation of true extinction and origination pulses we find support for several important revisions to the macroevolutionary history of crinoids. First in contrast to the uncorrected data sample standardized genus richness does not appear to increase by more than 20 PeRcEnT after an abrupt Middle Ordovician (Harnagian) diversification. Second the only significant short term change in genus richness following the Harnagian increase is a   24 PeRcEnT decline from the Rawtheyan to the Hirnantian. Third volatility in rates of genus extinction is increased after adjusting for preservation and there remain significant peaks of extinction in the Rawtheyan which marks the end Ordovician extinction and in the middle of the Early Silurian. Finally significant increases in origination rates occur in the Early Silurian. These results reaffirm the importance of the end Ordovician extinction for crinoids but they also highlight the comparatively poorly sampled Early Silurian as a time of turnover among crinoids. Crinoid genus extinction rates are positively correlated with area weighted rates of sedimentary package truncation suggesting that extinction may have been controlled by physical environmental changes such as the contraction of unique epicontinental sea habitats. The lack of a correlation between genus origination and sedimentary package initiation reinforces this hypothesis and suggests that other factors such as evolutionary innovations and biotic interactions during the Ordovician radiation may have been more important in controlling the diversification of crinoids. 1623:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The concept of coordinated stasis manifest as a pattern of long intervals of concurrent taxonomic and ecologic persistence separated by comparatively abrupt periods of biotic change has been challenged in recent studies that claim a lack of prolonged persistence of taxa and associations. A key problem has been the difficulty of distinguishing faunal change owing to localized short term environmental fluctuation or patchiness from that indicating regionally pervasive long term evolutionary or ecological change. Here we use an extensive database from the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group of the Appalachian Basin to test for taxonomic and ecologic persistence within this ecological evolutionary subunit a succession Of purported relative stability. Replicate samples collected from many localities and stratigraphic horizons over a wide geographic area allow us to address the effects of small scale environmental variation and localized faunal patchiness while exploring basin scale variation in faunal composition within and between the formations of the Hamilton Group. Observed stratigraphic distributions of fossils are consistent with a scenario in which all taxa are present from bottom to top of the Hamilton Group and absences result only from sampling failure. Although small scale variation in faunal composition indeed does occur there is no more variation among formations than occurs within them Assemblages from different formations whether the) are defined by taxonomic or ecologic composition are statistically indistinguishable according to several independent metrics including ANOSIM and a maximum likelihood estimation that evaluates stratigraphic turnover using Bayesian   Information Criterion.   Simulated data sets indicate that test results are most consistent with species level extinction of 2.6 PeRcEnT per Myr within the Hamilton Group far lower than the Givetian rate of 11.5 PeRcEnT per Myr generic extinction derived from a global database. Such faunal persistence over the similar to 5.5 Myr encompassed by this unit is consistent with the pattern of coordinated stasis. Earlier Studies showing greater amount ; of temporal turnover in Hamilton Group faunas are likely influenced by their smaller geographic scale of analysis suggesting that regional Studies done elsewhere may yield similar results. 1626:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The fossil record has been used to show that in some geologic intervals certain traits of taxa may increase their survivability and therefore that the risk of extinction is not randomly distributed among taxa. It has also been Suggested that traits that buffer against extinction in background times do not confer the same resistance during mass extinction events. An open question is whether at any time in geologic history extinction probabilities were randomly distributed among taxa. Here we use a method for detecting random extinction to demonstrate that during both background and mass extinction times extinction of marine invertebrate genera has been nonrandom with respect to species richness categories of genera. A possible cause for this nonrandom extinction is selective clustering of extinctions in genera consisting of species which possess extinction biasing traits. Other potential causes considered here include geographic selectivity increased extinction susceptibility for species in species rich genera or biases related to taxonomic practice and or sampling heterogeneity. An important theoretical result is that extinction selectivity at the species level cannot be smoothly extrapolated upward to genera; the appearance of random genus extinction with respect to species richness of genera results when extinction has been highly selective at the species level. 1627:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The middle Carboniferous was an interval of global change when the climate was transitioning from greenhouse to icehouse conditions. Field collections of paleotropical brachiopod assemblages across the Mississippian Pennsylvanian boundary reveal a taxonomic turnover event in which the overall diversity structure is conserved despite an apparent regional extinction of 63 PeRcEnT of latest Mississippian genera and an apparent regional origination of 50 PeRcEnT of earliest Pennsylvanian. An analysis of the global ranges of the brachiopods encountered in the field reveals that turnover was driven primarily by extirpation and immigration rather than true extinctions and originations. Taxonomic richness and evenness are indistinguishable between the latest Mississippian and earliest Pennsylvanian stages. Additive diversity partitioning shows that the within collection between collections  within bed) and between bed diversity components do not change across the Mississippian Pennsylvanian boundary for richness or evenness. Rank abundance plots of genera show the same distribution for both stages but with no correlation between the Mississippian abundances of range through genera and their abundance in the Pennsylvanian. Detrended correspondence analysis shows a major change in taxonomic composition across that Mississippian Pennsylvanian boundary and consistency in the general gradient along which genera were distributed. An estimation of spatio temporal heterogeneity of taxonomic composition within each stage reveals that the earliest Pennsylvanian was significantly more homogeneous. These results suggest that middle Carboniferous brachiopod assemblages from tropical shallow water carbonate platform settings were organized by some factor that was independent of the specific taxa present. Furthermore the increased homogeneity in taxonomic composition in the Morrowan did not affect the overall diversity structure. Strong competitive interactions among taxa do not appear to be important in determining the taxonomic compositions and abundances of brachiopod stage level assemblages. 1628:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Ordovician Radiation exhibited a global transition in dominance from the Cambrian evolutionary fauna  trilobites) to the Paleozoic and Modern faunas  articulate brachiopods and bivalve molluscs). Although its causes have yet to be determined definitively the transition coincided with increased global tectonism. Erosion of source areas uplifted during orogenic activity increased the siliciclastic richness of marine substrates in many venues and it has been hypothesized previously that higher taxa with affinities for siliciclastics diversified in association with these environmental changes whereas higher taxa not exhibiting such affinities either failed to radiate or declined in diversity. Here we provide an initial test of this substrate affinity hypothesis by evaluating the Ordovician affinities of trilobites and articulate brachiopods. Our analyses at the class level for both trilobites and articulate brachiopods and at the order level for orthid and strophomenid brachiopods were based on the affinities of constituent genera for siliciclastic carbonate and mixed siliciclastic carbonate settings. Individual genus affinities are calculated with a database of genus occurrences encompassing nine Ordovician paleocontinents. Using these values we developed a standardized relative affinity (SRA) metric to compare the propensities of higher taxa and to assess changes in relative affinities of individual higher taxa from series to series. A simple comparison of trilobites and articulate brachiopods for the Ordovician in aggregate does not appear to support the substrate affinity hypothesis: articulate brachiopods which contributed increasingly to overall diversity through the period exhibit in overall affinity for carbonates and an aversion to siliciclastics. However a rather different view emerges when we Consider the affinity trajectories of higher taxa through the period: articulate brachiopods exhibit a growing affinity for siliciclastics and a declining affinity for carbonates whereas the Opposite is the case among trilobites. Among constituent articulate brachiopod orders the affinity trajectories of orthids and strophomenids mirror that of the class. Thus the increasing dominance of articulate brachiopods in the Middle and Late Ordovician may have been linked to the affinity for siliciclastics of a diversifying subset of the group but further investigation will be required to verify this claim. 1629:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The process of evolution hinders our ability to make large scale ecological comparisons such as those encompassing marine biotas spanning the Phanerozoic because the compared entities are taxonomically and morphologically dissimilar. One solution is to focus instead on life habits which are repeatedly discovered by taxa because of convergence. Such an approach is applied to a comparison of the ecological diversity of Paleozoic (Cambrian Devonian) and modern marine biotas from deep subtidal soft substrate habitats. Ecological diversity (richness and disparity) is operationalized by using a standardized ecospace framework that can be applied equally to extant and extinct organisms and is logically independent of taxonomy. Because individual states in the framework are chosen a priori and not customized for particular taxa the framework fulfills the requirements of a universal theoretical ecospace. Unique ecological life habits can be recognized as each discrete n dimensional combination of character states in the framework. Although the basic unit of analysis remains the organism the framework can be applied to other entities species clades or multispecies; assemblages for the study of comparative paleoecology and ecology. Because the framework is quantifiable it is amenable to analytical techniques used for morphological disparity. Using these methods I demonstrate that the composite Paleozoic biota is approximately as rich in life habits as the sampled modern biota but that the life habits in the modern biota are significantly more disparate than those in the Paleozoic; these results are robust to taphonomic standardization. Despite broadly similar distributions of life habits revealed by multivariate ordination the modern biota is composed of life habits that are significantly enriched among others in mobility infaunality carnivory and exploitation of other organisms (or structures) for occupation of microhabitats. 162:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, North American mammals experienced a major mass extinction at the Cretaceous Tertiary (K T) boundary that is tied unambiguously to the Chicxulub impact event. Immediately afterwards there was an immense adaptive radiation that greatly expanded taxonomic diversity and the range of body sizes and ecological strategies. However ties between later Cenozoic impact events and specific episodes in mammalian evolution cannot be demonstrated. A time series of maximum known crater sizes within 1.0 million year long temporal bins is shown not to cross correlate with five separate measures of taxonomic turnover rate one measure of change in relative taxonomic composition and four measures of change in body mass distributions. The lack of correlation persists even after excluding the volatile Paleocene mammalian data adding dummy data to represent intervals without known craters or lagging the time series against each other for up to 5 million years. Furthermore the data fail to support broad brush correspondences between ages of major ( 20 km in diameter) craters and the timing of five key post K T biotic transitions including medium sized extinction episodes during the late Paleocene and latest Miocene. The results challenge the idea that extraterrestrial impacts drive all most or even many extinction and radiation episodes in terrestrial organisms and add to other evidence that natural long term biotic changes are often independent of changes in the physical environment. 1630:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The study of ancient biodiversity trends is confounded by biases of the paleontologic record but standardizing sampling intensity among time intervals can ameliorate sample size biases. We show that several existing standardization methods are intimately linked to the spatial components of diversity (alpha the within assemblage diversity; and beta the between assemblage diversity). The subsampling curves generated by these methods can also be generated by various manipulations of alpha and beta so that one can predict the responses of the methods to specific changes in alpha or beta diversity. The responses of the subsampling methods to changes in total diversity depend on whether measured alpha or measured beta diversity changed. Like biodiversity sampling consists of a within sample component (the number of specimens collected per locality) and a between sample component (the number of localities). Several subsampling methods (rarefaction OW (OW) W 2) attempt to standardize sampling effort at both levels although they use no direct information on the former. Instead they alter sampling intensity at the beta level to compensate for perceived biases at the alpha level. We show that alpha and beta diversity are not so easily interchangeable and that the accuracy of the subsampling methods depends critically on the spatial characteristics of diversity in a data set. Current methods are calibrated only to the abundance richness characteristics of individual collections but the amount of beta diversity and the degree to which the rareness commonness of taxa correlates among samples also strongly affect the accuracy of the subsampling methods. We offer new calibrations based on empirical data sets that account for these factors. Our findings do not support Alroy .s (2001) tentative claim that the taxonomic radiation in the Cenozoic marine realm is an artifact of biased sampling intensity. Their diversity curves that most strongly contradict Sepkoskis traditional Phanerozoic curve are based on a method that overcorrects for local sample size biases whereas the remaining curves are either consistent with the traditional curve or ambiguous because of the limited temporal and taxonomic coverage of the analysis. Other factors may bias Sepkoskis curve but there is insufficient evidence to claim that variations in sampling intensity are the major determinant of its long term trajectory. 1631:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper tests whether the most common fossil brachiopod gastropod and bivalve genera also have intrinsically more durable shells. Commonness was quantified using occurrence frequency of the 450 most frequently occurring genera of these groups in the Paleobiology Database (PBDB). Durability was scored for each taxon on the basis of shell size thickness reinforcement (ribs folds spines) mineralogy and microstructural organic content. Contrary to taphonomic expectation common genera in the PBDB are as likely to be small thin shelled and unreinforced as large thick shelled ribbed folded or spiny. In fact only six of the 30 tests we performed showed a statistically significant relationship between durability and occurrence frequency and these six tests were equally divided in supporting or contradicting the taphonomic expectation. Thus for the most commonly occurring genera in these three important groups taphonomic effects are either neutral with respect to durability or compensated for by other factors  less durable taxa were more common in the original communities). These results suggest that biological information is retained in the occurrence frequency patterns of our target groups. 1632:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This payer documents a series of methodological innovations that are relevant to macroevolutionary studies. The new methods are applied to updated faunal and body mass data sets for North American fossil mammals documenting several key trends across the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic. The methods are (1) A maximum likelihood formulation of appearance event ordination. The reformulated criterion involves generating a maximally likely hypothesized relative ordering of first and last appearances  an age range chart). The criterion takes faunal occurrences stratigraphic relationships and the sampling probability of individual genera and species into account. (2) A nonparametric temporal interpolation method called   shrink wrapping   that makes it possible to employ the greatest possible number of tie points without violating monotonicity or allowing abrupt changes in slopes. The new calibration method is used in computing pro visional definitions of boundaries among North American land mammal ages. (3) Additional methods for randomized subsampling of faunal lists one weighting the number of lists that have been drawn by the sum of the square of the number of occurrences in each list and one further modifying this approach to account for long term changes in average local species richness. (4) Footes new equations for instantaneous speciation and extinction rates. The equations are rederived and used to generate time series confirm that logistic dynamics result from the diversity dependence of speciation but not extinction and define the median duration of species  2.6 m.y for Eocene Pleistocene mammals). (5) A method employing the G likelihood ratio statistic that is used to quantify the volatility of changes in the relative proportion of species falling in each of several major taxonomic groups. (6) Univariate measures of body mass distributions based on ordinary moment statistics (mean standard deviation skewness kurtosis). These measures are favored over the method of cenogram analysis. Data are presented showing that even diverse individual fossil collections merely yield a noisy version of the same pattern seen in the overall continental data set. peaks in speciation rates extinction rates proportional volatility and shifts in body mass distributions occur at different times suggesting that environmental perturbations do not have simple effects on the biota. 1633:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the extent to which the reported fossil record reflects biological history rather than preservational artifacts or other biasing factors remains one of the central issues in the interpretation of the history of life on Earth. The development of large interactive paleontological databases such as the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) allows detailed analyses of the patterns of occurrence both regionally and globally of taxa in the fossil record and makes possible testing hypotheses of the controls of the patterns. An analysis of data from the PBDB shows that most genera in the fossil record are rare whereas a relatively small percentage of taxa account for a disproportionate share of the total occurrences. These ubiquitous taxa tend to be speciose and have long stratigraphic ranges. These patterns of occurrence might represent a true biological signal; it is also possible that they reflect taphonomic processes or are the result of taxonomic practice. In particular common taxa may be taxonomic wastebaskets residual and polyphyletic groups resulting from inadequate systematic attention and or from taphonomic biases resulting in inadequate specimens being preferentially placed in particular genera. A conceptual model for the development of taxonomic wastebaskets suggests that these taxa should be speciose widely distributed common and old (in terms of year of first description) and that they should be the nominate forms for higher taxa. Our analyses suggest that many of the common taxa in the PBDB are consistent with two or more of these expectations and are thus good candidates for being wastebaskets. These taxa are however only a small percentage of total genera. A more detailed examination of one group early gastropods indicates that possible wastebaskets still are present in a group that has received much recent systematic work. Given that likely wastebasket taxa are a small fraction of all genera they probably have little effect on overall temporal patterns of generic richness. Their impact on other types of metrics such as turnover rates or metrics of community diversity or biogeographic similarity however might be quite important. 1634:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding what drives global diversity requires knowledge of the processes that control diversity and turnover at a variety of geographic and temporal scales. This is of particular importance in the study of mass extinctions which have disproportionate effects on the global ecosystem and have been shown to vary geographically in extinction magnitude and rate of recoverv Here we analyze regional diversity and turnover patterns for the paleocontinents of Laurentia Baltica and Avalonia spanning the Late Ordovician mass extinction and Early Silurian recovery. Using a database of genus occurrences for inarticulate and articulate brachiopods bivalves anthozoans and trilobites we show that sampling standardized diversity trends differ for the three relions. Diversity rebounded to pre extinction levels within 5 Myr in the paleocontinent of Laurentia compared with 15 Myr or longer for Baltica and Avalonia. This increased rate of recovery in Laurentia was due to both lower Late Ordovician extinction rates and higher Early Silurian origination rates relative to the other continents. Using brachiopod data we dissected the Rhuddanian recovery into genus origination and invasion. This analysis revealed that standing diversity in the Rhuddanian consisted of a higher proportion of invading taxa in Laurentia than in either Baltica or Avalonia. Removing invading genera from diversity counts caused Rhuddanian diversity to fall in Laurentia. However Laurentian diversity still rebounded to pre extinction levels within 10 Myr of the extinction event indicating that genus origination rates were also higher in Laurentia than in either Baltica or Avalonia. Though brachiopod diversity in Laurentia was lower than in the higher latitude continents prior to the extinction increased immigration and genus origination rates made it the most diverse continent following the extinction. Higher rates of origination in Laurentia may be explained by its large size paleogeographic location and vast epicontinental seas. It is possible that the tropical position of Laurentia buffered it somewhat from the intense climatic fluctuations associated with the extinction event reducing extinction intensities and allowing for a more rapid rebound in this region. Hypotheses explaining the increased levels of invasion into Laurentia remain largely untested and require further scrutiny. Nevertheless the Late Ordovician mass extinction joins the Late. Permian and end Cretaceous as global extinction events displaying an onderlying spatial complexity. 1635:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We assessed selective extinction patterns in bivalves during a late Neogene mass extinction event observed along the temperate Pacific coast of South America. The analysis of 99 late Neogene and Quaternary fossil sites (recorded from 7 degrees S to 55 degrees S) yielding similar to 2800 occurrences and 118 species revealed an abrupt decline in Lyellian percentages during the late Neogene Pleistocene suggesting the existence of a mass extinction that decimated similar to 66 PeRcEnT of the original assemblage. Using the late Neogene data set (n 59 species 1346 occurrences) we tested whether the extinction was nonrandom according to taxonomic structure life habit geographic range and body size. Our results showed that the number of higher taxa that went extinct was not different than expected by random. At first sight extinction was selective only according to life habit and geographic range. i Nevertheless when phylogenetic effects were accounted for body size also showed significant selectivity. In general epifaunal small sized (after phylogenetic correction) and short ranged species tended to have increased probability of extinction. This is verified by strong interactions between the variables herein analyzed suggesting the existence of nonlinear effects on extinction chances. In the heavily decimated epifaunal forms survival was not enhanced by widespread ranges or larger body sizes. Conversely the widespread and large sized infaunal forms tended to have lower probability of extinction. Overall the ultimate extinction of late Neogene bivalve species along the Pacific coast of South America seems to have been determined by a complex interplay of ecological and historical (phylogenetic) effects. 1636:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We compare refined data sets for Atlantic benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope ratios and for North American mammalian diversity faunal turnover and body mass distributions. Each data set spans the late Paleocene through Pleistocene and has temporal resolution of 1.0 m.y.; the mammal data are restricted to western North America. We use the isotope data to compute five separate time series: oxygen isotope ratios at the midpoint of each 1.0 m.y. bin; changes in these ratios across bins; absolute values of these changes ( isotopic volatility); standard deviations of multiple isotope measurements within each bin; and standard deviations that have been detrended and corrected for serial correlation. For the mammals we compute 12 different variables: standing diversity at the start of each bin; per lineage origination and extinction rates; total turnover; net diversification; the absolute value of net diversification ( diversification volatility); change in proportional representation of major orders as measured by a simple index and by a G slatistic; and the mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of body mass. Simple and liberal statistical analyses fail to show any consistent relationship between any two isotope and mammalian time series other than some unavoidable correlations between a few untransformed highly autocorrelated time series like the raw isotope and mean body mass curves. Standard methods of detrending and differencing remove these correlations. Some of the major climate shifts indicated by oxygen isotope records do correspond to major ecological and evolutionary transitions in the mammalian biota but the nature of these correspondences is unpredictable and several other such transitions occur at times of relatively little global climate change. We conclude that given currently available climate records we cannot show that the impact of climate change on the broad patterns of mammalian evolution involves linear forcings; instead we see only the relatively unpredictable effects of a few major events. Over the scale of the whole Cenozoic intrinsic biotic factors like logistic diversity dynamics and within lineage evolutionary trends seem to be far more important. 1637:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a quantitative analysis of megafloral turnover across the Cretaceous Paleogene boundary (K T) based on the most complete record which comes from the Williston Basin in southwestern North Dakota. More than 22 000 specimens of 353 species have been recovered from 161 localities in a stratigraphic section that is continuous across and temporally calibrated to the K T and two paleomagnetic reversals. Floral composition changes dynamically during the Cretaceous shifts sharply at the K T and is virtually static during the Paleocene. The K T is associated with the loss of nearly all dominant species a significant drop in species richness and no subsequent recovery. Only 29 of 130 Cretaceous species that appear in more than one stratigraphic level (non singletons) cross the K T. Only 11 non singletons appear first during the Paleocene. The survivors most of which were minor elements of Cretaceous floras dominate the impoverished Paleocene floras. Confidence intervals show that the range terminations of most Cretaceous plant taxa are well sampled. We infer that nearly all species with last appearances more than about 5 m below (approximately 70 Kyr before) the K T truly disappeared before the boundary because of normal turnover dynamics and climate changes; these species should not be counted as K T victims. Maxima of last appearances occur from 5 to 3 m below the K T. Interpretation of these last appearances at a fine stratigraphic scale is problematic because of local facies changes and megafloral data alone even with confidence intervals are not sufficient for precise location of an extinction horizon. For this purpose we rely on high resolution palynological data previously recovered from continuous facies in the same sections; these place a major plant extinction event precisely at the K T impact horizon. Accordingly we interpret the significant cluster of last appearances less than 5 m below the K T as the signal of a real extinction at the K T that is recorded slightly down section. A maximum estimate of plant extinction based on species lost that were present in the uppermost 5 m of Cretaceous strata is 57 PeRcEnT. Palynological data with higher stratigraphic but lower taxonomic resolution than the megafloral results provide a minimum estimate of a 30 PeRcEnT extinction. The 57 PeRcEnT estimate is significantly lower than previous megafloral observations but these were based on a larger thickness of latest Cretaceous strata including most of a globally warm interval and were less sensitive to turnover before the K T. The loss of one third to three fifths of plant species supports a scenario of sudden ecosystem collapse presumably caused by the Chicxulub impact. 1667:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A rich body of empirically grounded theory has developed about food webs the networks of feeding relationships among species within habitats. However detailed food web data and analyses are lacking for ancient ecosystems largely because of the low resolution of taxa coupled with uncertain and incomplete information about feeding interactions. These impediments appear insurmountable for most fossil assemblages; however a few assemblages with excellent soft body preservation across trophic levels are candidates for food web data compilation and topological analysis. Here we present plausible detailed food webs for the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale assemblages from the Cambrian Period. Analyses of degree distributions and other structural network properties including sensitivity analyses of the effects of uncertainty associated with Cambrian diet designations suggest that these early Paleozoic communities share remarkably similar topology with modern food webs. Observed regularities reflect a systematic dependence of structure on the numbers of taxa and links in a web. Most aspects of Cambrian food web structure are well characterized by a simple   niche model which was developed for modern food webs and takes into account this scale dependence. However a few aspects of topology differ between the ancient and recent webs: longer path lengths between species and more species in feeding loops in the earlier Chengjiang web and higher variability in the number of links per species for both Cambrian webs. Our results are relatively insensitive to the exclusion of low certainty or random links. The many similarities between Cambrian and recent food webs point toward surprisingly strong and enduring constraints on the organization of complex feeding interactions among metazoan species. The few differences could reflect a transition to more strongly integrated and constrained trophic organization within ecosystems following the rapid diversification of species body plans and trophic roles during the Cambrian radiation. More research is needed to explore the generality of food web structure through deep time and across habitats especially to investigate potential mechanisms that could give rise to similar structure as well as any differences. 1718:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, When most people think of paleontology they picture the field paleontologist digging up fossils with a toothbrush and publishing descriptions of the anatomies of uncovered specimens in the trade literature. New discoveries of dinosaurs even make the national headlines. For many decades the discovery and description of a previously unknown fossil species was the calling card that gained would be paleontologists professional acceptance. However in the last quarter of a century or so many of the most intriguing new results in paleontology have come not from field studies but from the compilation and analysis of large scale databases of fossil species. These databases have provided us with quantitative pictures of the pattern and size of mass extinction events the rate at which new species have appeared and crucially the number of species on the planet through time the so called standing diversity. In an article appearing in this issue of PNAS John Alroy Charles Marshall and a large group of distinguished collaborators report on the creation of a new database that catalogs fossils at the level of individual collections. Preliminary analysis of this database reveals interesting results calling into question some fundamental ideas about the history of life on Earth. There are three principal features worthy of note in the paper by Alroy . First the paper announces the creation of the new database. Second the authors describe new methods of data analysis made possible by the database that help to eliminate biases inherent in previous studies as a result of variations in patterns of fossil preservation and collection. Third these new methods raise doubts about the long held belief that biodiversity has increased dramatically in the last 250 million years; it may in fact be that diversity has been roughly constant although no firm verdict has been reached yet on this point. Statistical analyses of species turnover and diversity in the fossil record have been dominated in the past by the work of one man Jack Sepkoski who from the early eighties until his death in May 1999 worked single handedly on the compilation of an encyclopedic database of occurrences of marine invertebrates in the fossil record using journal publications as his primary source. Other compilations also have been published but Sepkoskis database has received more attention by far than any other. Sepkoskis database was simple in structure: it recorded the first and last known occurrences in the fossil record of more than 30 000 marine invertebrate genera in about 4 000 families. Marine invertebrates have been the focus of most statistical studies because preservation is much more reliable in marine environments and invertebrates are much more numerous than vertebrates. Time was measured in stratigraphic stages uneven intervals defined by using a variety of geological and paleontological markers. Many features of the fossil record have been deduced from Sepkoskis data. One of the most famous which is a plot of the total number of genera in the database as a function of time during the Phanerozoic__approximately the last 540 million years from the so called Cambrian explosion of metazoan diversity until the present day. The shape of this curve mirrors the accepted view of lifes history on the planet: a burst of diversification in the Cambrian and Ordovician followed by a rough plateau in diversity for about 200 million years in the latter half of the Paleozoic until the dip in the center of the figure which represents the massive late Permian extinction event. Following this extinction it appears that diversity first recovered and then increased substantially during the Mezozoic and Cenozoic rising to a present day level two or more times higher than any seen during the Paleozoic. Sepkoskis database although extensive and thorough has a number of shortcomings. In particular it records only first and last occurrences of taxa anywhere in the world and no other data such as how commonly taxa occur or where. Thus very widely occurring taxa are accorded exactly the same status as ones that are found rarely. Also by the very fact that the database is as exhaustive as possible substantial biases are introduced. For example it is quite feasible that the increase in diversity toward recent times is a result primarily of the greater volume of rock available from recent times and the greater amount of effort that has been put into studying these rocks. A number of studies over the years have presented evidence showing that apparent diversity is closely correlated with the intensity with which different periods of geologic time have been sampled. The new database compiled by Alroy and coworkers (one of whom is the same Jack Sepkoski mentioned above) attempts to correct some of these problems by including more comprehensive data about fossil taxa in particular dividing data into collections__groups of fossils recovered from specific locales by specific workers or teams__with repeated occurrences of taxa at different times and places explicitly noted. Like the database of Sepkoski the new database focuses on marine invertebrates and is at present incomplete__work is still continuing on the compilation. Currently it covers two time periods of about 150 million years each one in the middle part of the Paleozoic during the plateau and one from the mid Mesozoic to the mid Cenozoic the central portion of the diversity increase. Because of the division of the database into collections Alroy and coworkers have been able to compensate for biases in the intensity of sampling of different time intervals and to some extent for varying quality of fossil preservation in their data and so make more accurate estimates of diversity (although as they are the first to emphasize biases are still present). Their technique of analysis involves breaking the data down in two ways. First they divide the data into roughly equal time intervals__more uniform in length than the intervals used by Sepkoski. Second within each interval they attempt to choose a constant number of actual fossil specimens as if the intensity of sampling across different times and places had been uniform rather than widely varying as it in fact is. Unfortunately only the number of taxa is recorded for many of their collections and not the number of specimens so it is not possible to fix specimen number directly. Instead therefore they have used a variety of different proxy techniques to simulate uniform sampling. The simplest such technique is to take a fixed number of collections (or lists as the authors call them) being careful that the ones chosen come from geographically distributed localities. This method works well if the sampling intensity is roughly the same from one collection to another. This however may not be the case so they also use several other techniques that weight lists according to their length and they report separate results for each of the different methods used. Clearly in the absence of more detailed information about which weighting is correct only results that are robust across different methods should be considered to have strong support. The diversity counts given by Alroy . are the total numbers of taxa seen across all collections sampled taken variously either during the time intervals of study or at the boundaries of those intervals. It is important to notice that these counts are not expected to be directly proportional to actual diversity (which is in any case not well defined). However the counts should increase monotonically with increasing real diversity and two intervals that have the same total count can be expected to have approximately equal real diversities. That is the results are comparable between different geologic times. To some extent the principal new contributions of the present study are the database itself and the sampling standardized methods for measuring diversity. However the preliminary results also offer some interesting suggestions of what is to come in this field. The authors make a host of different observations about the results of their calculations but perhaps the most interesting is that most of their measures of biodiversity are found to give approximately equal figures for diversity in the two time periods studied. Recall that derived from the earlier work of Sepkoski the two periods showed very different behavior the first having a rough plateau in diversity the second showing a marked diversity increase. This increase is not clearly visible in the new results suggesting that the supposed post Paleozoic diversification of marine fauna may be merely an artifact of biases in the Sepkoski database. It should be emphasized however that these results are by no means final and it is too early to draw any firm conclusions from the data. The creation of this new database of the fossil record may well have far reaching effects. The mere fact that most of the previous work in this area has made use of just a single source of data__the Sepkoski compilation__makes the creation of an independent database an important and worthwhile enterprise. However the inclusion in this new database of far more detailed information on frequency of occurrence of taxa opens the way for statistically superior analyses of fossil biodiversity and other quantities which have not been possible before. The paper appearing in this issue represents only the first effort in this direction and we can hope to see many new and interesting results emerging as the database and the analytical methods applied to it mature. 1730:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Estimates of biodiversity in both living and fossil groups depend on raw counts of currently recognized named species but many of these names eventually will prove to be synonyms or otherwise invalid. This difficult bias can be resolved with a simple flux ratio equation that compares historical rates of invalidation and revalidation. Flux ratio analysis of a taxonomic data set of unrivalled completeness for 4 861 North American fossil mammal species shows that 24 31 PeRcEnT of currently accepted names eventually will prove invalid so diversity estimates are inflated by 32 44 PeRcEnT. The estimate is conservative compared with one obtained by using an older more basic method. Although the degree of inflation varies through both historical and evolutionary time it has a minor impact on previously published background origination and extinction rates. Several lines of evidence suggest that the same bias probably affects more poorly studied hyperdiverse living groups such as fungi and insects. If so then current estimates of total global diversity could be revised downwards to as low as 3.5 10.5 million species. 1735:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Global diversity curves reflect more than just the number of taxa that have existed through time: they also mirror variation in the nature of the fossil record and the way the record is reported. These sampling effects are best quantified by assembling and analyzing large numbers of locality specific biotic inventories. Here we introduce a new database of this kind for the Phanerozoic fossil record of marine invertebrates. We apply four substantially distinct analytical methods that estimate taxonomic diversity by quantifying and correcting for variation through time in the number and nature of inventories. Variation introduced by the use of two dramatically different counting protocols also is explored. We present sampling standardized diversity estimates for two long intervals that sum to 300 Myr (Middle Ordovician Carboniferous; Late Jurassic Paleogene) Our new curves differ considerably from traditional synoptic curves. For example some of them imply unexpectedly low late Cretaceous and early Tertiary diversity levels. However such factors as the current emphasis in the database on North America and Europe still obscure our view of the global history of marine biodiversity. These limitations will be addressed as the database and methods are refined. 1744:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Latitudinal species diversity gradients (LSDGs) in the Northern Hemisphere are the most well established biogeographic patterns on Earth. Despite long standing interest in LSDGs as a central problem in ecology their explanation remains uncertain. In terrestrial as well as coastal and pelagic marine ecosystems these poleward declines in diversity typically have been represented and interpreted in terms of species richness the number of coexisting species. Newly discovered LSDGs in the bathyal (500 4 000 m) benthos of the North Atlantic may help to resolve the underlying causes of these large scale trends because the deep sea is such a physically distinct environment. However a major problem in comparing surface and deep sea LSDGs is that the latter have been measured differently by using species diversity indices that are affected by both species richness and the evenness of relative abundance. Here we demonstrate that deep sea isopods gastropods and bivalves in the North Atlantic do exhibit poleward decreases in species richness just as those found in other environments. A comprehensive systematic revision of the largest deepsea gastropod family (Turridae) has provided a unique database on geographic distributions that is directly comparable to those used to document LSDGs in surface biotas. This taxon also shows a poleward decline in the number of species. Seasonal organic enrichment from sinking phytodetritus is the most plausible ecological explanation for deep sea LSDGs and is the environmental factor most consistently associated with depressed diversity in a variety of bathyal habitats. 1768:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The average body size of brachiopods from a single habitat type increased gradually by more than two orders of magnitude during their initial Cambrian Devonian radiation. This increase occurred nearly in parallel across all major brachiopod clades (classes and orders) and is consistent with Copes rule: the tendency for size to increase over geological time. The increase is not observed within small constituent clades (represented here by families) which underwent random unbiased size changes. This scale dependence is caused by the preferential origination of new families possessing initially larger body sizes. However this increased family body size does not confer advantages in terms of greater geological duration or genus richness over families possessing smaller body sizes. We suggest that the combination of size biased origination of families and parallel size increases among major more inclusive brachiopod clades from a single habitat type is best explained by long term secular environmental changes during the Paleozoic that provide opportunities for body size increases associated with major morphological evolution. 1769:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The discipline wide effort to database the fossil record at the occurrence level has made it possible to estimate marine invertebrate extinction and origination rates with much greater accuracy. The new data show that two biotic mechanisms have hastened recoveries from mass extinctions and confined diversity to a relatively narrow range over the past 500 million years (Myr). First a drop in diversity of any size correlates with low extinction rates immediately afterward so much so that extinction would almost come to a halt if diversity dropped by 90 PeRcEnT. Second very high extinction rates are followed by equally high origination rates. The two relationships predict that the rebound from the current mass extinction will take at least 10 Myr and perhaps 40 Myr if it rivals the Permo Triassic catastrophe. Regardless any large event will result in a dramatic ecological and taxonomic restructuring of the biosphere. The data also confirm that extinction and origination rates both declined through the Phanerozoic and that several extinctions in addition to the Permo Triassic event were particularly severe. However the trend may be driven by taxonomic biases and the rates vary in accord with a simple log normal distribution so there is no sharp distinction between background and mass extinctions. Furthermore the lack of any significant autocorrelation in the data is inconsistent with macroevolutionary theories of periodicity or self organized criticality. 1779:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the evolutionary role of mass extinctions requires detailed knowledge of postextinction recoveries. However most models of recovery hinge on a direct reading of the fossil record and several recent studies have suggested that the fossil record is especially incomplete for recovery intervals immediately after mass extinctions. Here we analyze a database of genus occurrences for the paleocontinent of Laurentia to determine the effects of regional processes on recovery and the effects of variations in preservation and sampling intensity on perceived diversity trends and taxonomic rates during the Late Ordovician mass extinction and Early Silurian recovery. After accounting for variation in sampling intensity we find that marine benthic diversity in Laurentia recovered to preextinction levels within 5 million years which is nearly 15 million years sooner than suggested by global compilations. The rapid turnover in Laurentia suggests that processes such as immigration may have been particularly important in the recovery of regional ecosystems from environmental perturbations. However additional regional studies and a global analysis of the Late Ordovician mass extinction that accounts for variations in sampling intensity are necessary to confirm this pattern. Because the record of Phanerozoic mass extinctions and postextinction recoveries may be compromised by variations in preservation and sampling intensity all should be reevaluated with sampling standardized analyses if the evolutionary role of mass extinctions is to be fully understood. 1785:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Wide geographic range is generally thought to buffer taxa against extinction but the strength of this effect has not been investigated for the great majority of the fossil record. Although the majority of genus extinctions have occurred between major mass extinctions little is known about extinction selectivity regimes during these   background   intervals. Consequently the question of whether selectivity regimes differ between background and mass extinctions is largely unresolved. Using logistic regression we evaluated the selectivity of genus survivorship with respect to geographic range by using a global database of fossil benthic marine invertebrates spanning the Cambrian through the Neogene periods an interval of approximate to 500 My. Our results show that wide geographic range has been significantly and positively associated with survivorship for the great majority of Phanerozoic time. Moreover the significant association between geographic range and survivorship remains after controlling for differences in species richness and abundance among genera. However mass extinctions and several second order extinction events exhibit less geographic range selectivity than predicted by range alone. Widespread environmental disturbance can explain the reduced association between geographic range and extinction risk by simultaneously affecting genera with similar ecological and physiological characteristics on global scales. Although factors other than geographic range have certainly affected extinction risk during many intervals geographic range is likely the most consistently significant predictor of extinction risk in the marine fossil record. 1812:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Occurrence based databases such as the Palaeobiology database (PBDB) provide means of accommodating the heterogeneities of the fossil record when evaluating historical diversity patterns. Although palaeontologists have given ample attention to the effects of taxonomic practice on diversity patterns derived from synoptic databases ( those using first and last appearances of taxa) workers have not examined the effects of taxonomic error on occurrence based diversity studies. Here we contrast diversity patterns and diversity dynamics between raw data and taxonomically vetted data in the PBDB to evaluate the effects of taxonomic errors. We examine three groups: Palaeozoic gastropods Jurassic bivalves and Cenozoic bivalves. We contrast genus level diversity patterns based on: (i) all occurrences assigned to a genus  both species records and records identifying only the genus) (ii) only occurrences for which a species is identified and (iii) only occurrences for which a species is identified but after vetting the genus to which the species is assigned. Extensive generic reassignments elevate origination and extinction rates within Palaeozoic gastropods and origination rates within Cenozoic bivalves. However vetting increases generic richness markedly only for Cenozoic bivalves and even then the increase is less than 10 PeRcEnT. Moreover the patterns of standing generic richness are highly similar under all three data treatments. Unless our results are unusual taxonomic standardization can elevate diversity dynamics in some cases but it will not greatly change inferred richness over time. 1827:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The validity of biological explanations of patterns of palaeodiversity has been called into question owing to an apparent correlation of diversity with the amount of sedimentary rock preserved. However this claim has largely been based on comprehensive estimates of global marine Phanerozoic diversity thus raising the question of whether a similar bias applies to the records of smaller well defined taxonomic groups. Here new data on European Caenozoic marine sedimentary rock outcrop area are presented and compared with European occurrences of three groups of marine mammals (cetaceans pinnipedimorphs and sirenians). Limited evidence was found for a correlation of outcrop area with marine mammal palaeodiversity. In addition similar patterns were identified in the cetacean and pinnipedimorph diversity data. This may point to the preservation of a genuine biological signal not overwhelmed by geological biases in the marine mammal diversity data and opens the door to further analyses of both marine mammal evolution and geological bias in other small and well defined groups of taxa. 1888:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Cluster analysis and correspondence analysis of Late Silurian (Ludlovian and Pridolian) land plant macrofossil genera and morphological traits yielded four phytogeographic units: 1) a North Laurussian unit (Bathurst Island) which lay near the palaeoequator; 2) a South Laurussian Northwest Gondwanan unit (Great Britain Podolia and Bolivia) which stretched from 18 degrees S palaeolatitude to 60 75 degrees S palaeolafitude; 3) a Kazakhstanian unit which probably lay north of the palaeoequator; and 4) a Northeast Gondwanan (Australian) unit at 10 degrees S palaeolafitude. Phytogeographic analyses based on both genera and morphological traits yielded the same phytogeographic units suggesting that the observed differentiation does not result from regional taxonomic usage. A data set composed of Pridolian assemblages and range through assemblages  assemblages composed of taxa that crossed the Siluro Devonian boundary in each region lacking unequivocal Pridolian late Late Silurian assemblages) yielded the same four phytogeographic units as did a data set composed of range through assemblages from all six regions having Late Silurian land plant macrofossils. Thus the observed phytogeographic differentiation does not result from regional differences in the age of floral assemblages. Zosterophylls (Zosterophyllum Distichophytum and Bathurstia) characterize assemblages from the equatorial North Laurussian unit. The near equatorial East Gondwanan (Australian) unit contains Zosterophyllum an undescribed endemic zosterophyll genus Hedeia the lycopsid Baragwanathia and one additional undescribed endemic genus which is probably a lycopsid Tims J.D.J. 1980. The Early Land Flora of Victoria. PhD Thesis University of Melbourne Melbourne Australia. . Thus in the Late Silurian zosterophylls and large lycopsids were most common in equatorial assemblages. The endemic genera Jugumella (a possible zosterophyll) and Cooksonella (a possible rhyniophyte) characterize the Kazakhstanian unit. Rhyniophytes and rhyniophytoids (Steganotheca Pertonella and the form genus Tarrantia) characterize the wide ranging South Laurussian Northwest Gondwanan unit. This unit may reflect the ecological constraints of Late Silurian land plants. If many Late Silurian land plants belonged to ruderal species with wide dispersal capability that flourished only during the growing season plants growing in seasonally dry and seasonally cold regions may have been quite similar. However the morphological simplicity of Late Silurian land plants could cause assemblages from seasonally dry and seasonally cold regions to appear similar even though they shared few biological genera. 1901:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Grayson overlooks the models key predictions concerning overall extinction rates extinction outcomes human population densities and human diet and just as importantly its robust logic and parameterization. The model correctly predicts that terminal megafaunal dates should be no younger than Clovis interval but Grayson demands that no apparent terminal dates should be older than Clovis. The data are sufficient to test the former prediction but not the latter: radiocarbon dates are scarce for all but six megafaunal genera and these genera did overlap with Clovis. Regardless speculating that some megafaunal species went extinct earlier accomplishes nothing because all reasonable models predict rapid extinctions. Indeed Grayson himself offers no possible explanation for staggered extinctions. As for Graysons second point there are kill sites not just for mammoths but also probably for mastodons and even giant tortoises; thus humans clearly were capable of hunting all terrestrial species. Kill sites for smaller species are not expected because small bones are fragile and so skeletons of smaller taxa are preserved only rarely outside of kill free natural trap environments. Furthermore the distribution of radioisotopic dates shows that proboscideans attract disproportionate study. More importantly of 61 confirmed latest Pleistocene M. columbi fossil sites some 9 sites or 15 PeRcEnT include kills but the simulation model conservatively predicts that just 9 PeRcEnT of Clovis era M. columbi deaths were caused by human hunting. Thus the kill site data do confirm overkill. In addition overkill accounts for a string of dramatic and otherwise inexplicable patterns. Why else would an extinction pulse (i) range from Alaska to Patagonia but have no contemporary effect on islands and Old World continents (although extinctions did invariably follow the invasion of these places by humans at earlier and later times); (ii) focus on geographically widespread environmentally unspecialized species but spare virtually all mammals less than 10 kg or plants of any kind; (iii) have no clear impact on surviving mammal communities; (iv) occur during a deglaciation that doubled the habitable area of the continent; (v) fail to occur during any of a half dozen comparable earlier deglaciation events; and (vi)find itself unmatched in selectivity and severity by any extinction during the preceding 65 million years during which time climate change showed no correlation with extinction?  1905:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Life only gets bigger and better or so one might infer from the history of marine life that paleontologists have drawn up in the past few decades. The number of distinctly different kinds of organisms living in the sea may have taken a hit now and again but over the long haul ocean life has only become more and more diverse the data seemed to show. But now a recount of fossils is giving paleontologists second thoughts about that ever upward trend. In a new record of life published this week in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 25 paleontologists demonstrate a fresh approach to extracting a history of life from an imperfect fossil record imperfectly sampled by paleontologists for 180 years. And the groups first preliminary results suggest that previous studies may indeed have overstated lifes penchant for diversification. Although far from the last word the method marks a turning point in the study of paleontological databases says co author Richard Bambach of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg. This isnt the end of the story but its a step in the direction we want to go he says. Paleontologists wouldnt need a new record of diversity if their predecessors had done it right the first time__laboriously sampling and documenting all the accessible exposures of fossil bearing rock around the world. Instead earlier researchers searched most intensively nearest to home__mostly Europe and North America__and often pursued paleontological novelty rather than systematic surveying. Making the best of a bad situation one paleontologist spent 20 years compiling a now classic diversity record from the hodgepodge of published and unpublished data. John Jack Sepkoski of the University of Chicago who died in 1999 at the age of 50 combed reports of marine fossil finds and created a phone book that listed each fossil genus by name the first time it appeared in the fossil record and the last time it appeared. From that database he plotted a diversity curve that rose sharply 500 million years ago as life burgeoned in the Cambrian explosion plateaued in the Paleozoic era and then rose steeply and steadily from the Mesozoic to the present day. Read literally Sepkoskis curve implied that the great Permian Triassic mass extinction at the end of the Paleozoic 250 million years ago somehow reignited lifes drive to diversify. Life in the seas became more active more predatory and continually more varied as the so called modern fauna found new ways to thrive. A nice story. But has diversity really tripled since the Paleozoic. We may have been misled for 20 years says paleontologist Douglas Erwin of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. There may be some real problems. The biggest may be that the harder paleontologists look at a particular rock outcrop or at outcrops from the same slice of geologic time the more kinds of fossils turn up. With the meager information in his phone book style compilation Sepkoski had no way of correcting for the wide range of sampling intensities from time to time or place to place or for other potential biases. To fill the gap paleontologists John Alroy of the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) Charles Marshall of Harvard University 23 colleagues and dozens more contributors are assembling the Paleobiology Database. Housed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UCSB the still growing database records a range of information beyond first and last appearance. Perhaps most important it contains the reported occurrences of a genus through time and space. Drawing on the compiled information Alroy and his colleagues sliced geologic history into 10 million year intervals and used statistics to try to even out the effects of varying sampling intensity in each interval. To bracket as many ways of correcting for bias as possible the group tried four ways to standardize the data and two ways to count fossil occurrences__a total of eight different statistical recipes. All eight approaches had much the same effect on the diversity curve. Whats surprising is that diversity in the post Paleozoic up to the Oligocene 24 million years ago doesnt shoot up as extremely as was originally found in Jacks data set says co author David Jablonski of the University of Chicago. If diversity really hasnt risen much since the Paleozoic then all of lifes innovations in the oceans since the days of the trilobites__from new predators to armored snails and burrowing clams__have been unable to break through some set ceiling on diversity. This paper represents a real step forward says ecologist Michael Rosenzweig of the University of Arizona in Tucson. For the first time a large group of people is saying paleobiology has been making a mistake that its very important to deal with sampling issues. And when you try to get rid of the biases the diversity curve looks a lot flatter. Rosenzweig like Alroy and his colleagues regards the paper as a progress report on the road to a larger and more thoroughly analyzed paleo data set. But even the most sophisticated data mining the scientists warn might not extract the true history of diversity. Paleontologist Jeremy Jackson of Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla California thinks existing data are still too biased to do the trick. It may be the information isnt there to begin with he says. The compilers of the Paleobiology Database intend to find out.  1911:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We thank Roopnarine . and Dietl and Vermeij for their comments on our time series analysis of ecological trends through the Phanerozoic eon and although we agree that some scenarios may explain our results we do not agree that large scale analyses are irrelevant because we can assume that the world is too complex to demonstrate causal relations at the largest scales. The central argument of both comments is that escalation in one place or in one trophic or taxonomic group is always canceled out at larger scales by de escalation in others and therefore cannot be tested at these scales. This claim is an empirical induction not a philosophical deduction so it needs to be tested instead of asserted. Shielding escalation by redefining it as partially untestable may be tempting but the use of such a strategy is the hallmark of a paradigm in retreat. Not only does the escalation hypothesis make a clear and crucial prediction of a global scale tradeoff between different ecological groups but a longer time series may well have evidenced a weak statistical interdependency. We have conducted a power analysis showing that nontrivial but still unimpressive r 2 values of up to 0.24 could exist. Our point is not that there is no relationship whatsoever but that it is not important at the global scale that is of the greatest interest to biologists. Roopnarine . misrepresent the motivation and implications of our time series analysis which was intended to isolate correlations with possible causal significance from correlations with no such significance and only secondarily was meant to correct for taphonomic bias. Cross correlations of autocorrelated time series are expected in the absence of even indirect causal connections; any two generally upward or downward trending time series will cross correlate. Therefore differencing is necessary to provide even the most basic evidence of a relationship. Roopnarine . state that a model of causality relating carnivore to noncarnivore frequency is flawed because of its simplicity but escalation is just such a model and its predictions are straightforward. More substantively they argue that in marine ecosystems that are strongly dominated by carnivores escalation may only be visible within carnivore guilds at different trophic levels. This seems plausible but not apropos of our data. First Roopnarine .s evidence that long trophic chains exist in our data consists of citations to papers on terrestrial vertebrates terrestrial plants and insects predominantly nonbenthic marine organisms like fish morphology and theoretical models. The paleontological literature on escalation however almost entirely concerns benthic invertebrates such as gastropods bivalves and brachiopods. Second our data show that the relative frequency and diversity of carnivorous invertebrates was rarely more than 10 PeRcEnT throughout most of the Phanerozoic and never more than 27 PeRcEnT. Most of the few carnivores were likely to be primary consumers and populations of high trophiclevel predators were likely to have been too small to have had much of an effect. Third the major groups comprising our noncarnivore categories are mostly immobile or infaunal so it is unlikely that we have scored them incorrectly. Fourth we specifically excluded vertebrates from our analysis because their fossil record is poor relative to shelly invertebrates. Finally the range of body masses within our major carnivore groups like gastropods and ammonites is rather narrow so it is unlikely that many trophic levels were represented. Roopnarine . present several scenarios that might explain why correlations might not emerge. None of these scenarios is testable in the absence of clear criteria for separating top and intermediate predators within benthic shelly invertebrates; an explanation for our results is not a criticism of them. Dietl and Vermeij object first to our having analyzed global data and second to our use of diversity data. They state that global data are not relevant to the trends they are trying to explain. However they are the trends we are trying to explain and global biodiversity is a topic of much discussion. Much of the literature on escalation is premised on the idea that it is a global phenomenon and if it is not then perhaps it is not such a key evolutionary process. More specifically they like Roopnarine . suggest that escalation might be more visible at local scales. We agree that it might be and hope that our results will encourage analyses at multiple scales that will explore the scale dependence of evolutionary processes instead of holding them back. Furthermore as we stated data on local areas and data spanning short time intervals are typically not open to the kind of rigorous time series analysis we performed. Although we strongly believe that local and global studies are complementary we also hold that time series analysis is a good way to test for evolutionary processes not just patterns. Dietl and Vermeij also state that diversity patterns are abstract epiphenomena that cannot yield information about selection or adaptation. The suggestion is that one should assume that all evolutionary processes operate at the population level. Again the large amount of research on global diversity shows that researchers in such areas as systematics macroevolution macroecology community ecology and conservation biology hold other less reductionistic views. Dietl and Vermeij overlook the fact that our data did not just address diversity but also occurrence frequency which we showed to capture the same temporal signals. Occurrence frequency is a product of ecological factors such as geographic range size breadth of environmental distribution and local abundance that are the focus of much research and presumably have some connection to evolution. Dietl and Vermeijs main point is to assert that organisms do evolve through interactions instead of addressing our data methods or argumentation. This hypothesis is exactly what we tested and found not to be demonstrable at the scale that is amenable to proper time series analysis. Arguing that a hypothesis is untestable when it is contradicted does not provide evidence for it and actually showing that the causal emergence it predicts is not very strong does provide evidence against it. 1920:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A profound faunal reorganization occurred near the Paleocene Eocene boundary when several groups of mammals abruptly appeared on the Holarctic continents. To test the hypothesis that this event featured the dispersal of groups from Asia to North America and Europe we used isotope stratigraphy magnetostratigraphy and quantitative biochronology to constrain the relative age of important Asian faunas. The extinct family Hyaenodontidae appeared in Asia before it did so in North America and the modern orders Primates Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla first appeared in Asia at or before the Paleocene Eocene boundary. These results are consistent with Asia being a center for early mammalian origination. 1928:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Cohorts of marine taxa that originated during recoveries from mass extinctions were commonly more widespread spatially than those originating at other times. Coupled with the recognition of a correlation between the geographic ranges and temporal longevities of marine taxa this observation predicts that recovery taxa were unusually long lived geologically. We analyzed this possibility by assessing the longevities of marine genus cohorts that originated in successive substages throughout the Phanerozoic. Results confirm that several mass extinction recovery cohorts were significantly longer lived than other cohorts but this effect was limited to the post Paleozoic suggesting differences in the dynamics of Paleozoic versus post Paleozoic diversification. 1934:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological interactions such as predation and bioturbation are thought to be fundamental determinants of macroevolutionary trends. A data set containing global occurrences of Phanerozoic fossils of benthic marine invertebrates shows escalatory trends in the relative frequency of ecological groups such as carnivores and noncarnivorous infaunal or mobile organisms. Associations between these trends are either statistically insignificant or interpretable as preservational effects. Thus there is no evidence that escalation drives macroecological trends at global and million year time scales. We also find that taxonomic richness and occurrence data are cross correlated which justifies the traditional use of one as a proxy of the other. 1949:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It has previously been thought that there was a steep Cretaceous and Cenozoic radiation of marine invertebrates. This pattern can be replicated with a new data set of fossil occurrences representing 3.5 million specimens but only when older analytical protocols are used. Moreover analyses that employ sampling standardization and more robust counting methods show a modest rise in diversity with no clear trend after the mid Cretaceous. Globally locally and at both high and low latitudes diversity was less than twice as high in the Neogene as in the mid Paleozoic. The ratio of global to local richness has changed little and a latitudinal diversity gradient was present in the early Paleozoic. 1951:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Likelihood analyses of 1176 fossil assemblages of marine organisms from Phanerozoic  Cambrian to Recent) assemblages indicate a shift in typical relative abundance distributions after the Paleozoic. Ecological theory associated with these abundance distributions implies that complex ecosystems are far more common among Meso Cenozoic assemblages than among the Paleozoic assemblages that preceded them. This transition coincides not with any major change in the way fossils are preserved or collected but with a shift from communities dominated by sessile epifaunal suspension feeders to communities with elevated diversities of mobile and infaunal taxa. This suggests that the end Permian extinction permanently altered prevailing marine ecosystem structure and precipitated high levels of ecological complexity and alpha diversity in the Meso Cenozoic. 1970:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The pace of Late Triassic (LT) biodiversity loss is uncertain yet it could help to decipher causal mechanisms of mass extinction. We investigated relative abundance distributions (RADs) of six LT plant assemblages from the Kap Stewart Group East Greenland to determine the pace of collapse of LT primary productivity. RADs displayed not simply decreases in the number of taxa but decreases in the number of common taxa. Likelihood tests rejected a hypothesis of continuously declining diversity. Instead the RAD shift occurred over the upper two to four fossil plant assemblages and most likely over the last three (final 13 meters) coinciding with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and global warming. Thus although the LT event did not induce mass extinction of plant families it accompanied major and abrupt change in their ecology and diversity. 1971:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The taxonomic diversity of ammonoids in terms of the number of taxa preserved provides an incomplete picture of the extinction pattern during the Permian because of a strongly biased fossil record. The analysis of morphological disparity (the variety of shell shapes) is a powerful complementary tool for testing hypotheses about the selectivity of extinction and permits the recognition of three distinct patterns. First a trend of decreasing disparity ranging for about 30 million years led to a minimum disparity immediately before the Permian Triassic boundary. Second the strongly selective Capitanian crisis fits a model of background extinction driven by standard environmental changes. Third the end Permian mass extinction operated as a random nonselective sorting of morphologies which is consistent with a catastrophic cause. 1983:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We describe an approach for pipelining nested data collections in scientific workflows. Our approach logically delimits arbitrarily nested collections of data tokens using special paired control tokens inserted into token streams and provides workflow components with high level operations for managing these collections. Our framework provides new capabilities for: (1) concurrent operation on collections; (2) on the fly customization of workflow component behavior; (3) improved handling of exceptions and faults; and (4) transparent passing of provenance and metadata within token streams. We demonstrate our approach using a workflow for inferring phylogenetic trees. We also describe future extensions to support richer typing mechanisms for facilitating sharing and reuse of workflow components between disciplines. This work represents a step towards our larger goal of exploiting collection oriented dataflow programming as a new paradigm for scientific workflow systems an approach we believe will significantly reduce the complexity of creating and reusing workflows and workflow components. 1985:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Derek J. de Solla Price was the first to notice that scientific collaboration has been increasing steadily and ever more rapidly since the beginning of the 20th century a process he deemed one of the most violent transitions that can be measured in recent trends of scientific manpower and literature surmising that if it continues at the present rate by 1980 the single author paper will be extinct. The consequences he saw were more extensive and enduring than a mere shift in the work habits of scientists: We tend now to communicate person to person instead of paper to paper. In the most active areas we diffuse knowledge through collaboration. Through select groups we seek prestige and the recognition of ourselves by our peers as approved and worthy collaborating colleagues. We publish for the small group forcing the pace as fast as it will go in a process that will force it harder yet. Only secondarily with the inertia born of tradition do we publish for the world at large. While the incipient demise of the single authored paper was somewhat exaggerated this powerful transformation of scientific work continues in ways and with consequences that Price did not anticipate. Collaborators today communicate from different continents and cultures synchronously or asynchronously in the languages of different nations and disciplines through a spectrum of technologies using diverse forms of expertise to produce heterogeneous mixes of knowledge products and solutions to problems. The select group that grants prestige and recognition accomplishes its collective purposes despite centrifugal forces. The published productivity of the group may not differ in quantity from that of an equal number of dissociated individuals so the impetus to collaborate lies elsewhere.1 Information communication and computing technologies now permit rich interaction over great distances not merely phone calls emails video conferences Internet sites and shared data repositories but also distal operation of scientific instruments and real time (or if preferred asynchronous) collaborative work (collaboratories ). Yet distance matters as Olson and Olson (2000) have shown so even the best technology must be complemented by activities that build trust and understanding through sustained face to face social interaction. Tensions and paradoxes are essential features of collaboration even within established co located research groups so the mere occurrence of face to face interaction does not insure that understanding and solidarity will result. 1996:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Paleontologists long have argued that the most important evolutionary radiation of mammals occurred during the early Cenozoic if not that all eutherians originated from a single common post Cretaceous ancestor. Nonetheless several recent molecular analyses claim to show that because several interordinal splits occurred during the Cretaceous a major therian radiation was then underway This claim conflicts with statistical evidence from the well sampled latest Cretaceous and Cenozoic North American fossil record. Paleofaunal data confirm that there were fewer mammalian species during the latest Cretaceous than during any interval of the Cenozoic and that a massive diversification took place during the early Paleocene immediately after a mass extinction. Measurement data show that Cretaceous mammals were on average small and occupied a narrow range of body sizes; after the Cretaceous Tertiary mass extinction there was a rapid and permanent shift in the mean. The fact that there was an early Cenozoic mammalian radiation is entirely compatible with the existence of a few Cretaceous splits among modern mammal lineages. 1998:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Taxonomic concepts (sensu Berendsohn) embody the underlying meanings of scientific names as stated in a particular publication thus offering a new way to resolve semantic ambiguities that result from multiple revisions of a taxonomic name. This paper presents a comprehensive and powerful language for representing the relationships among taxonomic concepts. The language features terms and symbols for concept relationships within a single taxonomic hierarchy or between two related but independently published hierarchies. Taxonomic concepts pertaining to a single hierarchy are characterised by parent child relationships whereas those pertaining to two independent hierarchies may have the following basic relationships: congruence inclusion (non symmetrical relative to the side of comparison) overlap and exclusion. The relationships are asserted by specialists who have the option to add or subtract concepts on one or both sides of a relationship equation in order to reconcile differences between non congruent taxonomic perspectives. The terms and or and not are available respectively to connect multiple simultaneously or alternatively valid relationship assessments or to explicitly negate the validity of a relationship. The language also permits the decomposition of a relationship according to the intensional (property referencing) and ostensive (member pointing) aspects of the compared taxonomic concepts. Adopting the concept relationship language will facilitate a more precise documentation of similarities and differences in multiple succeeding taxonomic perspectives thereby preparing the stage for an ontology based integration of taxonomic and related biological information. 2026:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recently several algorithms a calculus of biodiversity have been proposed to provide a more objective phylogenetic basis for conservation decisions. But do such quantitative approaches yield the purported objectivity or can the conservation value of species and areas be measured using phylogenetic information? To answer these and similar questions John Gittleman and Michael McKinney established a Phylogeny and Conservation working group sponsored by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara CA USA. The first of three annual meetings last August represented a collaborative effort among ecologists evolutionary biologists paleontologists systematists and conservation biologists from the USA Canada Australia and England. The first two days laid the groundwork for the rest of the week. Paul Williams impressed the participants with a demonstration of his WORLDMAP software program for exploring geographical patterns in biodiversity rarity and conservation priorities. Quick introductions to the online Tree of Life project and the TreeBASE archive as potential sources of phylogenetic trees also were provided. Initial discussion centered on two recent publications by Nee and May and Warwick and Clarke. Both papers represent important attempts to integrate phylogenetics and conservation biology. The former demonstrated that surprising amounts of phylogenetic diversity might remain even under high rates of (random) extinction. The latter suggested that recent extinction events  owing to pollution) at least in the marine environment could be detected through missing phylogenetic diversity. Discussions about both articles prompted the creation of two subgroups. One subgroup extended previous work examining the issues of quantifying the distribution of traits such as extinction risk across taxonomic groups (taxonomic selectivity ). A second subgroup explored the phylogenetic and conservation implications of geographic concentrations of biodiversity (hotspots ). The remaining members of the working group formed a third subgroup which examined the value of the evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) concept for designating units for conservation action below the species level. Taxonomic selectivity or random extinctions? A fundamental assumption made in Nee and Mays simulation study was that extinction was random with respect to phylogeny. Recent studies many by members of the working group indicate that this is not realistic; within taxonomic groups as diverse as mammals birds and plants extinctions and invasions were highly clumped and were not distributed randomly. However these studies used different measures of the clumpiness of the desired traits (taxonomic selectivity ) which complicates comparisons across studies and taxonomic groups. Furthermore the measures used in the studies probably are influenced by various characteristics of the underlying phylogenies or taxonomies. Recognizing these limitations the selectivity subgroup sought to discover a statistic that could detect taxonomic selectivity independent of tree size  number of species) tree shape  degree of balance of the tree) or prevalence of the desired trait  proportion of all species that are endangered or invasive). Morans I adapted as a measure of phylogenetic autocorrelation received the most attention as a likely candidate statistic. The rest of the meeting was devoted to testing the performance of Morans I at detecting selectivity. The subgroup simulated trees in which tree balance tree size and the degree of clumpiness of a trait were manipulated to study the degree of dependence of the I statistic on these characteristics. Preliminary results were promising; Morans I seems to accurately detect selectivity regardless of tree size or shape. Once the performance of Morans I and alternative statistics have been tested sufficiently the subgroup plans to propose one statistic that will allow standardized comparisons of the selectivity of extinctions rarity and invasions among different real data sets. This will allow the subgroup to address several questions including: how selectivity varies across a wide variety of taxonomic groups; how selectivity varies across geographical regions; how selectivity varies between higher and lower taxonomic units; and how selectivity for extinction is related to selectivity for invasion within taxonomic groups. By developing a suitable statistic the subgroup hopes to provide an important fundamental tool for evaluating hypotheses about the causes and the consequences of taxonomic selectivity in extinctions and in invasions. 238:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,258:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,261:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,297:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A bone assemblage of 133 bones from a series of upland environments in central Wales is described. The study area comprises unfenced hill land on the tops and upper slopes of the hills that is interspersed with fenced rough grazing in the valleys between. The area is largely razed by sheep with some hill ponies and occasional cows. Wild animals include foxes and badgers in addition to small mammals. The bones are a surface assemblage from natural deaths of sheep and this assemblage is linked with a long term taphonomic naturalistic experiment based on over 100 individual animal carcasses continuously monitored since time of death. Preservation of skeletal elements is found to be strongly associated with structural density of the bone with more dense bones being preferentially preserved. The bones have been dispersed by the scavenging activities of Foxes and dogs and in the process some elements have been broken producing a characteristic spectrum of gnawing marks on the surfaces of shafts articular ends and on the edges of spiral breaks. Bones have been subsequently modified by weathering and transport resulting in significant loss of material. The resulting bone assemblage is described together with the modifications produced by the above mentioned taphonomic agents. 382:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,389:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Assessing species survival status is an essential component of conservation programs. We devised a new statistical method for estimating the probability of species persistence from the temporal sequence of collection dates of museum specimens. To complement this approach we developed quantitative stopping rules for terminating the search for missing or allegedly extinct species. These stopping rules are based on survey data for counts of co occurring species that are encountered in the search for a target species. We illustrate both these methods with a case study of the Ivory billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) long assumed to have become extinct in the United States in the 1950s but reportedly rediscovered in 2004. We analyzed the temporal pattern of the collection dates of 239 geo referenced museum specimens collected throughout the southeastern United States from 1853 to 1932 and estimated the probability of persistence in 2011 as  6.4 x 10( 5) with a probable extinction date no later than 1980. From an analysis of avian census data (counts of individuals) at 4 sites where searches for the woodpecker were conducted since 2004 we estimated that at most 13 undetected species may remain in 3 sites (one each in Louisiana Mississippi Florida). At a fourth site on the Congaree River (South Carolina) no singletons (species represented by one observation) remained after 15 500 counts of individual birds indicating that the number of species already recorded (56) is unlikely to increase with additional survey effort. Collectively these results suggest there is virtually no chance the Ivory billed Woodpecker is currently extant within its historical range in the southeastern United States. The results also suggest conservation resources devoted to its rediscovery and recovery could be better allocated to other species. The methods we describe for estimating species extinction dates and the probability of persistence are generally applicable to other species for which sufficient museum collections and field census results are available. 41:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,424:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,458:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, De Bruijn . described a new genus of cricetid like muroid rodent Mirabella from the eastern Mediterranean. The type species is M. tuberosa from the Early Miocene locality of Aliveri (Island of Evia Greece). The name had already appeared in Benda and De Bruijn but only as a nomen nudum. Apart from the type species De Bruijn . also defined M. intermedia from the Anatolian locality of Harami I. However this species was transferred subsequently to Deperetomys. Instead another Mirabella M. anatolica was described also from Harami I as well as M. crenulata from the somewhat younger locality of Kesek__y. The presence of the genus in two central European localities was also noted therein. The original classification in the Eucricetodontinae partly based on the species intermedia was changed into Paracricetodontinae. Unfortunately Kalthoff did not analyse the microstructure of the lower incisors of Mirabella so its allocation remains uncertain for the time being. 463:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,465:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Scientific workflows facilitate automation reuse and reproducibility of scientific data management and analysis tasks. Scientific workflows are often modeled as dataflow networks chaining together processing components (called actors) that query transform analyse and visualize scientific datasets. Semantic annotations relate data and actor schemas with conceptual information from a shared ontology to support scientific workflow design discovery reuse and validation in the presence of thousands of potentially useful actors and datasets. However the creation of semantic annotations is complex and time consuming. We present a calculus and two inference algorithms to automatically propagate semantic annotations through workflow actors described by relational queries. Given an input annotation alpha and a query q forward propagation computes an output annotation alpha; conversely backward propagation infers alpha from q and alpha. 472:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Our knowledge of deep sea biodiversity is based almost entirely on morphological distinctions at the species level. Here we use haplotype variations in the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal gene to assess biodiversity at the genome level in four deep sea molluscan morphospecies. Genetic divergence levels among populations of the morphospecies fall within the range of interspecific divergence found in coastal marine and aquatic molluscan genera. Results indicate a rich population structure at the genetic level in deep sea mollusks and suggest the possibility that some seemingly coherent morphospecies are composed of cryptic species. 473:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Chemoautotrophic communities on lipid rich whale skeletons are known from a total of 16 modern and fossil sites in the deep Pacific Ocean. While the attached fauna of modern whale bones has been studied the impact of whale falls on surrounding sediment assemblages remains largely unevaluated. Using the research submersible Alvin we sampled the sediment community at distances of 0 0.5 1 2 4 and similar to 100 m from the lipid rich skeleton of a 21 m balaenopterid on the 1240 m seafloor in Santa Catalina Basin. When sampled in 1988 and 1991 the skeleton had been on the seafloor for   4 yr and supported a large attached chemoautotrophic assemblage. Sedimentary organic content microbial biomass and bacterial abundance were not significantly different near the skeleton than in background sediments and pore water sulfide concentrations were only modestly elevated (to less than or equal to 20 mu M) adjacent to the bones. The species composition of infaunal macrobenthos near the skeleton was similar to that in background sediments providing little evidence of a specialized enrichment and or sulfophilic assemblage. Nonetheless macrofaunal abundance within 0.5 m of the skeleton was reduced by   40 PeRcEnT due to a decline in the paraonid polychaete Levinsenia oculata. The reduction in L. oculata (the community dominant) caused a sharp increase in rarefaction diversity near the skeleton. Bioturbation intensities evaluated from (234)Th profiles were also dramatically reduced in sediments near the skeleton as were rates of extracellular lipase activity. We postulate that reduced infaunal abundance and bioturbation near the skeleton resulted from the interference effects of vesicomyid clam shell debris and that the low bioturbation rates in turn limited extracellular lipase activity. We conclude that whale skeletons and the remains of their associated chemoautotrophic assemblages may physically impact nearby sediment communities for pears after the organic and sulfide enrichment effects of whale falls have dissipated yielding changes in infaunal diversity and bioturbation. 474:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most isopod crustaceans in the North Atlantic deep sea belong to the suborder Asellota. In contrast South Atlantic isopod faunas have a significant component of flabelliferan isopods a phylogenetic clade that contains suborders derived evolutionarily later than the Asellota. The flabelliferans decrease diversity from shallow water to deep water and on a south to north latitudinal gradient. Although many asellote families are endemic to the deep sea none of the flabelliferan families appear to have evolved in the abyss. Recent colonisations of the deep sea which may have been limited to the southern hemisphere by oceanographic conditions have significant consequences for observed regional diversities of some taxa. Instability in oceanographic conditions owing to glaciation and benthic storms may have further limited benthic species richness of the North Atlantic deep sea benthos. 475:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The evolution of body size is a problem of fundamental interest? and one that has an important bearing on community structure and conservation of biodiversity. The most obvious and pervasive characteristic of the deep sea benthos is the small size of most species. The numerous attempts to document and explain geographic patterns of body size in the deep sea benthos have focused on variation among species or whole faunal components and have led to conflicting and contradictory results. It is important to recognize that studying size as an adaptation to the deep sea environment should include analyses within species using measures of size that are standardized to common growth stages. An analysis within eight species of deep sea benthic gastropods presented here reveals a clear trend for size to increase with depth in both larval and adult shells. An ANCOVA with multiple comparison tests showed that in general size depth relationships for both adult and larval shells are more pronounced in the bathyal region than in the abyss. This result reinforces the notion that steepness of the bathymetric selective gradient decreases with depth and that the bathyal region is an evolutionary hotspot that promotes diversification. Bathymetric size dines in gastropods support neither the predictions of optimality models nor earlier arguments based on tradeoffs among scaling factors. As in other environments body size is inversely related to both abundance and species density. We suggest that the decrease in nutrient input with depth may select for larger size because of its metabolic or competitive advantages and that larger size plays a role in limiting diversity. Adaptation is an important evolutionary driving force of biological diversity and geographic patterns of body size could help unify ecological and historical theories of deep sea biodiversity. 476:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Through extraordinary research and training of graduate students Robert R. Hessler has profoundly influenced our knowledge of biodiversity in the deep sea. This special volume honors his contributions and presents recent advances in the study of deep sea biodiversity on a broad range of topics. 47:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Bathymetric gradients of biodiversity in the deep sea benthos constitute a major class of large scale biogeographic phenomena. They are typically portrayed and interpreted as variation in a diversity (the number of species recovered in individual samples) along depth transects. Here we examine the depth ranges of deep sea gastropods and bivalves in the eastern and western North Atlantic. This approach shows that the abyssal molluscan fauna largely represents deeper range extensions for a subset of bathyal species. Most abyssal species have larval dispersal and adults live at densities that appear to be too low for successful reproduction. These patterns suggest a new explanation for abyssal biodiversity. For many species bathyal and abyssal populations may form a source sink system in which abyssal populations are regulated by a balance between chronic extinction arising from vulnerabilities to Allee effects and immigration from bathyal sources. An increased significance of source sink dynamics with depth may be driven by the exponential decrease in organic carbon flux to the benthos with increasing depth and distance from productive coastal systems. The abyss which is the largest marine benthic environment may afford more limited ecological and evolutionary opportunity than the bathyal zone. 54:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,602:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A graphical user interface is presented that allows users of taxonomic data to explore concept relationships between conflicting but related taxonomic classifications. Ecological analyses that use taxonomic metadata depend on accurate naming of specimens and taxa and if the metadata involves several taxonomies care has to be taken to match concepts between them. To perform this accurately requires expert defined concept relationships which are more complex yet more representative than the simple one to one mappings found through simple name matching and can accommodate nomenclatural changes and differences in classification technique (cf lumpers versus splitters). in the SEEK Taxon (Scientific Environment for Ecological Knowledge) project we aim to help users of taxonomic datasets untangle and understand these relationships through a prototype visual interface which graphically displays these relationship structures allowing users to comprehend such information and more accurately name their data. 606:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Experts often disagree about the organization of biological taxa. The shifting definitions of taxonomic names complicate otherwise simple queries concerning these taxa. For example a query such as   how many occurrences of specimens in genus G are recorded in database D   will return different answers depending on whose definition of genus G is used. In our proposed framework taxonomic classifications of multiple experts are captured using first order logic (FOL). Specifically taxonomies and relationships between them are viewed as sets of first order formulas constraining the possible interpretations of names and concepts in the taxonomies. The formalization of taxonomies and the relationships between them via our FOL language L tax allows us to clarify (a) what it means for a taxonomy to be consistent (b) to be inconsistent (c) whether a new relationship between two taxa  a congruence A B) is implied thus   filling logic gaps   and (d) whether two taxonomies from different authorities together with a taxonomy mapping (articulation) from a third authority are mutually consistent. We illustrate our logic based formalization and the resulting opportunities for automated reasoning support for biological taxonomies using examples involving the classification of a genus of plants. We elaborate on (a d) above and give some example derivations in logic. We also show that while reasoning in Ltax is decidable it might still be computationally hard  NP complete) and thus infeasible over large taxonomies and articulations. By employing results from the spatial algebra RCC 5 we identify an important class of efficient taxonomy articulations whose satisfiability can be checked in polynomial time. 680:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,700:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Following habitat fragmentation individual habitat patches may lose species over time is they pay off their   extinction debt.   Species with relatively low rates of population extinction and colonization (  slow   species) may maintain extinction debts for particularly prolonged periods but few data are available to test this prediction. We analyzed two unusually detailed data sets on forest plant distributions and land Use history from Lincolnshire United Kingdom and Vlaams Brabant Belgium to test for an extinction debt in relation to species specific extinction and colonization rates. Logistic regression models predicting the presence absence of 36 plant species were first parameterized using data from Lincolnshire where forest cover has been relatively low (similar to 5 8 PeRcEnT) for the past 1000 years. Consistent with extinction debt theory for relatively slow species (but not fast species) these models systematically underpredicted levels of patch occupancy in Vlaams Brabant where forest cover was reduced from similar to 25 PeRcEnT to   10 PeRcEnT between 1775 and 1900 (it is presently 6.5 PeRcEnT). As a consequence the ability of the Lincolnshire models to predict patch occupancy in Vlaams Brabant was worse for slow than for fast species. Thus more than a century after forest fragmentation reached its current level an extinction debt persists for species with low rates of population turnover. 898:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The mechanisms responsible for latitudinal biodiversity gradients have fascinated and perplexed biologists since the time of Darwin. Ecological theory has yielded two general classes of mechanisms to account for variation in biodiversity: dispersal assembly mechanisms that invoke differences in stochastic rates of speciation extinction and dispersal; and niche assembly mechanisms that invoke species differences species interactions and environmental heterogeneity. Distinguishing between these two classes of mechanisms requires explicit consideration of macroevolutionary dynamics. Here we assess the importance of dispersal assembly mechanisms in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity using fossil data that encompass 30 million years of macroevolution for three distinct groups of ocean plankton: foraminifera nannoplankton and radiolaria. Applying new methods of analysis to these fossil data we show here for the first time that latitudinal biodiversity gradients exhibit strong positive correlations with speciation rates even after explicitly controlling for variation in sampling effort and for increases in habitat area towards the equator. These findings provide compelling evidence that geographical variation in macroevolutionary dynamics is a primary determinant of contemporary biodiversity gradients as predicted by dispersal assembly theory. 920:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We tested the hypothesis that fertilisation increases community and ecosystem variability while reducing predictability using annual fossil records from fertilised Lake 227 Experimental Lakes Area Ontario Canada. Comparison of fossil pigments from unperturbed and eutrophied periods using a median log Levenes test demonstrated that variability increased significantly during enrichment for fetal algae (chlorophyll a sum of carotenoids) cyanobacteria (aphanizophyll luteinzeaxanthin) chlorophytes (pheophytin b lutein zeaxanthin) and cryptophytes (alloxanthin) but not for other algal taxa (chrysophytes dinoflagellates) or herbivory (pheophorbides). Dynamic linear models (DLMs) of individual time series showed that forecast accuracy declined during enrichment for taxa which showed increased variability while forecast uncertainty increased for all fossil pigments. DLMs of simulated data identified a strong inverse relationship between variability and predictability suggesting that predictability will decline whenever variability increases. These findings imply that anthropogenic eutrophication of ecosystems may destabilise lakes obscure impacts of global change and reduce the sensitivity of whole ecosystem experiments. 92:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,993:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The shift to smaller body size in marine invertebrates at the deep sea threshold and size depth dines within the deep sea ecosystem are global biogeographic phenomena that remain poorly understood. We present the first standardized measurements of larval and adult size among ecologically and phylogenetically similar species across a broad and continuous depth range using the largest family of deep sea gastropods (the Turridae). Size at all life stages increases significantly with depth from the upper bathyal region to the abyssal plain. These consistent dines may result from selection favoring larger size at greater depths because of its metabolic and competitive advantages. The unusually small size of deep sea mollusks in general may represent an independent evolutionary process that favors invasion by inshore taxa composed of small organisms. 1013:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Does optimality in predator prey models with plastic traits evolving on a fast time scale imply evolutionary stability? Mathematical methods: Predator prey models of population growth described by differential equations with controls and feedback regulation. G function. Key assumptions: Plastic responses of organisms to changes in environment are adaptive in the sense that they maximize individual fitness. Population dynamics are deterministic and described by the Lotka Volterra type dynamics. Predictions: Adaptive plastic responses do not necessarily lead to evolutionary stability. Mutants with a different strategy can invade a monomorphic resident population but they cannot replace residents. 1039:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In recent studies a new class of models dealing with evolutionary processes on the large timescale have shown that many of the general traits of the fossil record can be reproduced under some simple assumptions. Additionally the study of living ecosystems and their network organization as well as the time series analysis of population fluctuations points in the direction that complex ecosystems are organized close to instability points where extinction of species and ecological turnover would be the rule. In this paper we further explore these ideas and their implications for our understanding of evolution as a complex dynamical process with some universal features linked with network level properties. In particular a source for the decoupling between micro and macroevolutionary mechanisms is provided. 1106:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A number of studies have demonstrated the ecological sorting of C 3 and C 4 grasses along temperature and moisture gradients. However previous studies of C 3 and C 4 grass biogeography have often inadvertently compared species in different and relatively unrelated lineages which are associated with different environmental settings and distinct adaptive traits. Such confounded comparisons of C 3 and C 4 grasses may bias our understanding of ecological sorting imposed strictly by photosynthetic pathway. Here we used MaxEnt species distribution modeling in combination with satellite data to understand the functional diversity of C 3 and C 4 grasses by comparing both large clades and closely related sister taxa. Similar to previous work we found that C 4 grasses showed a preference for regions with higher temperatures and lower precipitation compared with grasses using the C 3 pathway. However air temperature differences were smaller (2 degrees C vs. 4 degrees C) and precipitation and PeRcEnT tree cover differences were larger (1783 mm vs. 755 mm 21.3 PeRcEnT vs. 7.7 PeRcEnT respectively) when comparing C 3 and C 4 grasses within the same clade vs. comparing all C 4 and all C 3 grasses  ignoring phylogenetic structure). These results were due to important differences in the environmental preferences of C 3 BEP and PACMAD clades (the two main grass clades). Winter precipitation was found to be more important for understanding the distribution and environmental niche of C 3 PACMADs in comparison with both C 3 BEPs and C 4 taxa for which temperature was much more important. Results comparing closely related C3C4 sister taxa supported the patterns derived from our modeling of the larger clade groupings. Our findings which are novel in comparing the distribution and niches of clades demonstrate that the evolutionary history of taxa is important for understanding the functional diversity of C 3 and C 4 grasses and should have implications for how grasslands will respond to global change. 1153:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Theoretical work suggests that species ecological niches should remain relatively constant over long term ecological time periods but empirical tests are few. We present longitudinal studies of 23 extant mammal species modelling ecological niches and predicting geographical distributions reciprocally between the Last Glacial Maximum and present to test this evolutionary conservatism. This study covered distributional shifts in mammal species across the lower 48 states of the United States. We used a machine learning tool for modelling species ecological niches based on known occurrences and electronic maps summarizing ecological dimensions to assess the ability of ecological niches as modelled in one time period to predict the geographical distribution of the species in another period and vice versa. High intertemporal predictivity between niche models and species occurrences indicate that niche conservatism is widespread among the taxa studied particularly when statistical power is considered as a reason for failure of reciprocal predictions. Niche projections to the present for 8 mammal taxa that became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene generally increased in area and thus do not support the hypothesis of niche collapse as a major driving force in their extinction. Ecological niches represent long term stable constraints on the distributional potential of species; indeed this study suggests that mammal species have tracked consistent climate profiles throughout the drastic climate change events that marked the end of the Pleistocene glaciations. Many current modelling efforts focusing on anticipating climate change effects on species potential geographical distributions will be bolstered by this result in essence the first longitudinal demonstration of niche conservatism. 1192:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Complex life histories are common in nature have many important biological consequences and are an important focal area for integrative biology. For organisms with complex life histories a legacy is something handed down from an ancestor or previous stage and can be genetic nutritional provisional experiential as well as the result of random chance and natural variation in the environment. As we learn more about complex life histories it becomes clear that legacies are inexorably linked in the short and long term through ecology and evolution. Understanding the consequences and drivers of life history patterns can therefore only be understood by considering all types of legacies and integrating legacies across the entire life cycle. Larry McEdward was a leader in the field of ecological physiology and evolutionary ecology of marine invertebrate larvae with complex life histories. Through his scientific work and publications devotion to students colleagues family and friends Larry has left a lasting legacy that will impact the future development of the field of larval ecology and complex life histories. 1193:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Schwenk and colleagues challenged biologists to develop a deeper understanding of the linkages between organisms and environments. These linkages are captured by the concept of the niche which has guided theoretical and empirical research in ecology for decades. Despite this research we still cannot explain or predict much of the variation in niches over space and time. This shortcoming hinders efforts to forecast biological responses to environmental change. We believe that progress has been slowed by poor coordination between theoretical and empirical efforts to understand the evolution of niches. Therefore progress should be sped by research programs that integrate modeling and experiments. Such research programs should focus on the structures of environmental variation the constraints on phenotypes and the relationships between phenotypes and fitness. 1204:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central goal of evolutionary biology is the development of a general predictive theory that incorporates the various forces structuring biological diversity. In this article we argue that a focus on allometry and metabolic scaling theory provides the basis to begin to mechanistically link and understand patterns observed at ecological and evolutionary timescales. To make our case we draw on and review several recently published papers and present new analyses. We argue that together this synthesized work supports the notion that selection has maximized the scaling of resource exchange surfaces  photosynthetic surface areas) yet simultaneously minimizes the scaling of transport times and resistances. As a result the scaling of plant metabolism in turn has profoundly influenced the evolution and ecology of plant form function and diversity probably since the inception of the chlorophytes. In particular we discuss preliminary support for the notion that stabilizing selection for 3 4 power scaling of metabolism in addition to competition for similar limiting resources has led to the emergence of regular ecological patterns that have likely been prevalent throughout plant evolution. 1270:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Stress occurring in periods shorter than life span strongly selects for reversible phenotypic plasticity for maximum reliability of stress indicating cues and for minimal response delays. The selective advantage of genotypes that are able to produce adaptive reversible plastic phenotypes is calculated by using the concept of environmental tolerance. Analytic expressions are given for optimal values of mode and breadth of tolerance functions for stress induced and non induced phenotypes depending on (1) length of stress periods (2) response delay for switching into the induced phenotype (3) response delay for rebuilding the non induced phenotype (4) intensity of stress mean value of the stress inducing environment (5) coefficient of variation of the stress environment and (6) completeness of information available to the stressed organism. Adaptively reversible phenotypic plastic traits will most probably affect fitness in a way that can be described by simultaneous reversible plasticity in mode and breadth of tolerance functions. 1271:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The evolution of ecological trade offs is an important component of ecological specialization and adaptive radiation. However the pattern that would show that evolutionary trade offs have occurred between traits among species has not been clearly defined. In this paper we propose a phylogeny based definition of an evolutionary trade off and apply it to an analysis of the evolution of trade offs in locomotor performance in emydid turtles. We quantified aquatic and terrestrial speed and endurance for up to 16 species including aquatic semi terrestrial and terrestrial emydids. Emydid phylogeny was reconstructed from morphological characters and nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences. Surprisingly we find that there have been no trade offs in aquatic and terrestrial speed among species. Instead specialization to aquatic and terrestrial habitats seems to have involved trade offs in speed and endurance. Given that trade offs between speed and endurance may be widespread they may underlie specialization to different habitats in many other groups. 1275:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, All plants and animals host complex communities of taxonomically diverse microbial assemblages (viruses Archaea Bacteria micro eukaryotes) that contribute to the functional attributes of the host organism. Scleractinian corals represent particularly provocative subjects for study in this context because they are morphologically complex and associate with a broad diversity of macro invertebrates and vertebrates as well as microorganisms. Representatives of all these taxonomic groupings have been shown to contribute to the function of corals through direct or indirect provisioning and cycling of nutrients waste removal defense and stress tolerance traits that influence the fitness and environmental thresholds of individual coral colonies. How the taxonomic composition functional limits and interactive nature of members of these communities vary among and within host species and scale up to influence community level processes that drive ecosystem structure and function through time and space is unknown; these communities are however taxonomically variable among individual corals. Here we draw on the published literature to discuss the ecological and functional significance of the broad and variable taxonomic symbioses found closely associated with corals. Using a comparative approach we hypothesize that the intra specific and inter specific variations in response of corals to environmental disturbance is linked to differences in the specificity nature and composition of these symbiotic assemblages and reflect variation in the architectural complexity (micro and macro) and capacity of corals to provision habitat. We describe individual coral colonies as symbiomes unique micro ecosystems bounded by the physical limits of the coral colony whose performance limits reflect the taxonomic range of the associates (micro and macro) found within the colony. We explicitly recognize the fact that corals represent complex ecological communities composed of organisms that have the potential to compete as well as interact with one another and the host as commensals mutualists and parasites states that likely to be dynamic with nature context and environment. . 132:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1339:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this paper we compile the network of software packages with regulatory interactions (dependences and conflicts) from Debian GNU Linux operating system and use it as an analogy for a gene regulatory network. Using a trace back algorithm We assemble networks from the pool of packages with both scale free (real data) and exponential (null model) topologies. We record the maximum number of packages that can be functionally installed in the system  the active network size). We show that scale free regulatory networks allow a larger active network size than random ones. This result might have implications for the number of expressed genes at steady state. Small genomes with scale free regulatory topologies could allow much more expression than large genomes with exponential topologies. This may have implications for the dynamics robustness and evolution of genomes. 1346:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We introduce the complementarity dilemma a two player binary response game in which the payoffs are highest when the two players respond differently. Using the classifier system EvA we determine the evolutionary dynamics and structure of strategies that evolve to play an iterated version of this game and we relate the results to the evolution of major types of sexual reproduction particularly simultaneous hermaphroditism. We find that complementarity strategies consistently evolve under a broad range of conditions but that those most consistent with simultaneous hermaphroditism can predominate only when a substantial cost of repeatedly adopting the female role is imposed. The cost is analogous to the fecundity reduction to be expected when a single partner must repeatedly produce the eggs in sexual reproduction. 137:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As better phylogenetic hypotheses become available for many groups of organisms studies in community ecology can be informed by knowledge of the evolutionary relationships among coexisting species. We note three primary approaches to integrating phylogenetic information into studies of community organization: 1. examining the phylogenetic structure of community assemblages exploring the phylogenetic basis of community niche structure and adding a community context to studies of trait evolution and biogeography. We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity relative abundance distributions and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction character reconstruction null models for community assembly and character evolution and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these areas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research. 141:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Supertree construction is a new rigorous approach for combining phylogenetic information to produce more inclusive phylogenies. It has been used to provide some of the largest most complete phylogenies for diverse groups  mammals flowering plants and dinosaurs) at a variety of taxonomic levels. We critically review methods for assembling supertrees discuss some of their more interesting mathematical properties and describe the strengths and limitations of the supertree approach. To document the need for supertrees in biology we identify how supertrees have already been used beyond the systematic information they provide to examine models of evolution test rates of cladogenesis detect patterns of trait evolution and extend phylogenetic information to biodiversity conservation. 1429:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The enormous cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence database being assembled from the various DNA barcoding projects as well as from independent phylogenetic studies constitutes an almost unprecedented amount of data for molecular systematics in addition to its role in species identification and discovery. As part of a study of the potential of this gene fragment to improve the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstructions and in particular exploring the effects of dense taxon sampling we have assembled a data set for the hyperdiverse cosmopolitan parasitic wasp superfamily Ichneumonoidea including the release of 1793 unpublished sequences. Of approximately 84 currently recognized Ichneumonoidea subfamilies 2500 genera and 41 000 described species barcoding 5 COI data were assembled for 4168 putative species level terminals (many undescribed) representing 671 genera and all but ten of the currently recognized subfamilies. After the removal of identical and near identical sequences the 4174 initial sequences were reduced to 3278. We show that when subjected to phylogenetic analysis using both maximum likelihood and parsimony there is a broad correlation between taxonomic congruence and number of included sequences. We additionally present a new measure of taxonomic congruence based upon the Simpson diversity index the Simpson dominance index which gives greater weight to morphologically recognized taxonomic groups (subfamilies) recovered with most representatives in one or a few contiguous groups or subclusters. 1434:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, I investigated the phylogenetic relationships within the New World Blepharida and among related genera using sequences of the Internal Transcriber Spacer 2 (ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and sequences of the COI and COII genes of the mitochondrial genome. Cladistic analyses were performed using parsimony maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. These methods generated almost identical topologies using the combined data sets. The analyses suggest that Blepharida rhois the type species should be separated from the New World Blepharida and that the New World Blepharida might be congeneric with closely related Notozona. Also according to this phylogeny all of the New World Blepharida species that feed on Bursera (Burseraceae) form a single monophyletic clade with the Afrotropical species forming its sister clade. The analyses also identified four main groups of species within the New World Blepharida. 1435:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, I reconstructed a phylogeny of 66 species and varieties of Bursera and 9 outgroup species using sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) the 5S non transcribed region (5S NTS) and the external transcribed region (ETS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA. This study extends a previously proposed parsimony based phylogenetic study that used the ITS sequences of 57 Bursera species and five outgroups. Parsimony and maximum likelihood methods were used to infer the phylogeny in this new study. Analyses of the combined data sets largely confirmed the phylogenetic relationships proposed by the previous molecular study but generated a considerably more robust topology. The new phylogenies corroborate the monophyly of the genus and its division into the two monophyletic subgenera or sections Bursera and Bullockia. The current analyses also identify four main groups of species in section Bursera and two in section Bullockia confirming some of the previously proposed groups based on fruit flower and leaf morphology. One previously problematic species B. sarcopoda which has sometimes been placed in Commiphora is shown to belong in Bursera. Another controversial species Commiphora leptophloeos which was thought to belong to Bursera falls within Commiphora. 1495:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A special series of events may be necessary to produce the stable species lineages detected in the fossil record and emphasized in the theory of punctuated equilibria: incipient speciation followed by stringent ecologic selection matching an ecologic opportunity (herein termed ELDREDGE pathways). The overall pattern of speciation is dominantly cladogenesis but a special place for phyletic evolution remains at the bridge connecting ancestors (which may persist) with descendants where newly formed species are rapidly honed to new resources and begin to take positions in stable regional ecosystems. 1550:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Our current understanding of the coevolutionary process has been based upon studies of six aspects of the biology of organisms that shape the potential for ongoing reciprocal evolutionary change in natural communities. These include analyses of the phylogenetic context of coevolving interactions patterns of specialization of species to one another the genetic architecture of coevolution and its ecological consequences the distributed outcomes of interspecific interactions; the rates and forms of selection on interactions within biological communities and the geographic dynamics of interacting species. These studies of the raw material for coevolution are helping replace the general concept of diffuse coevolution with more testable hypotheses on the structure and ongoing dynamics of reciprocal evolutionary change within natural communities. 1554:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial heterogeneity in the selection imposed by different predator species could promote the adaptive diversification of local prey populations. However high gene flow might swamp local adaptations at limited spatial scales or generalized phenotypic plasticity might evolve in place of local diversification. Spotted salamander larvae Ambystoma maculatum face strongly varying risks from gape limited marbled salamander larvae Ambystoma opacum and gape unconstrained diving beetle larvae Dytiscus spp. across natural landscapes. To evaluate if A. maculatum adapts to these predation risk across micro geographic scales I measured selection gradients in response to the two focal predators and then assayed the defensive morphologies of ten populations in a common garden experiment. I found that A. opacum induced selection on A. maculatum for larger tailfins and bodies whereas beetles induced selection for larger tail muscles and smaller bodies. In accordance with the local adaptation hypothesis A. maculatum populations inhabiting ponds with high beetle densities grew larger tail muscles relative to other populations when raised in a common environment. However populations exposed to strong A. opacum selection did not evolve larger tailfins as predicted. High gene flow or morphological plasticity could explain the absence of this morphological response to A. opacum. Overall results suggest that populations can sometimes evolve adaptive traits in response to locally variable selection regimes even across the very limited distances that separate populations in this study. If prey populations often differ in their defenses against local predators then this variation could affect the outcome of species interactions in local communities. 1574:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Paleobiologists reviewing the recent literature on species concepts are likely to come away with the impression that the fundamental unit of biodiversity is impossible to define in terms of a universal concept that applies to all forms of cellular life and the varied outcomes of species level evolution. Operational concepts are likely to differ from specialty to specialty in biology but a general theory of species has been available for nearly 50 yr in the form of G.G. Simpsons evolutionary species concept. In addition to this a general picture of species structure has been accepted for at least as long consisting of demes or habitat clusters that bud off other demes clusters split fuse and often go extinct. More recently it has become obvious that the outcomes or products of species level evolution may include any of the following: speciation with morphologic differentiation (producing the so called good species of applied biology and probably the stable entities resolved in patterns of stasis in the fossil record); speciation without pronounced phenotypic differentiation (cryptic species) or acquisition of diagnosable characters without either complete reproductive isolation or pronounced morphologic change. The view that species are lineages containing networks of demes (or habitat clusters of uniparental organisms) each with its own biologic tendencies and role with a unique place within a clade composed of similar historical entities. each having a certain kind of internal structure and resulting from a different evolutionary outcome is the ultimate concept many of the operational approaches seem to be aiming to uncover. Considering species structure speciation outcomes and the evolutionary species concept together brings the nature of species into a much sharper focus. 1594:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The study of evolutionary trends is one of the oldest and most intriguing topics in evolutionary biology and paleobiology. Workers since Cuvier Lyell and Owen have wanted to know if the fossil record demonstrates   progression   within temporal sequences of related organisms. Regardless of whether changes in the average values of morphological characters are progressive in any meaningful sense these changes are still of great interest. In practice questions about trends are most commonly framed by paleontologists in terms of   complexity   (however defined) or body size. Research on evolutionary trends has intensified over the last few years bringing several fundamental conceptual issues to a head. Here I analyze these conceptual problems concluding that paleontologists should largely abandon a key method used in most studies: comparing among species morphological distributions in successive time slices irrespective of phylogenetic patterns. These data supposedly may distinguish random evolution constant directional trends and diffusion away from morphological boundaries. However many other simple evolutionary dynamics may result in the same nonrandom trends making it difficult to distinguish qualitatively distinct mechanisms using time slice data. Thus I will try to show that comparisons between ancestral and descendant morphologies need to be made instead. The fundamental problem here is not so much mathematical or statistical as conceptual. Null hypotheses have not always been framed rigorously and the logical connection between underlying hypotheses and methods for testing these hypotheses has sometimes been weak. Although paleontologists have long since embraced the use of null models they still do not employ a single straightforward definition of   randomness  . As a result different authors use different null hypotheses and depending on their conceptual outlooks they may interpret the same kinds of patterns as either confirming or refuting the existence of trends. Considering the volume of literature and the century long genealogy of the subject this lingering panoply of viewpoints may come as a surprise. Two points of confusion are responsible for the lack of agreement. First it has been recognized for more than two decades now that morphological trends may result from processes operating at different levels of the phylogenetic hierarchy. However it is not always easy to say whether a particular pattern shows that nonrandom evolution is occurring at a particular hierarchical level. Second most workers have tried to fit evolutionary patterns into binary categories of randomness and nonrandomness. However nearly identical evolutionary trends may be generated by a surprisingly large number of qualitatively distinct mechanisms even within a single hierarchical level. The real question then is not whether evolution is random but instead exactly what mechanisms do govern demonstrable trends and at what hierarchical level these mechanisms operate. The ancestor descendant method advocated here may solve both problems at once. It should often point to a proximate mechanism that generates a trend if there is one illustrating such a mechanism clearly even if it is quite complex. Because the data only apply to within lineage patterns the approach also avoids the common error of conflating processes operating at different hierarchical levels. 15:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1625:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The fossil record displays remarkable stasis in many species over long time periods yet studies of extant populations often reveal rapid phenotypic evolution and genetic differentiation among populations. Recent advances in our understanding of the fossil record and in population genetics and evolutionary ecology point to the complex geographic structure of species being fundamental to resolution of how taxa can commonly exhibit both short term evolutionary dynamics and long term stasis. 163:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The evolution of avian migratory systems has been of intense interest to ornithologists. The consensus is that a sedentary ancestor began to move seasonally within an ancestral distribution in response to some influence__ either a push  poor conditions on the ancestral distribution) or a pull  better conditions elsewhere)__and that local tracking eventually extended to long distance predictable movements. One particularly well developed hypothesis is that local movements of tropical bird species tracking variable or uncertain resources (either food or space for breeding) evolved into regular seasonal and longer distance movements. That line of thought originally based on Nearctic Neotropical migrants has been partially supported in an independent system the austral migrants in South America. New perspectives on the evolution of migration may prove useful. A question that has not received sufficient attention is the degree to which a species is tracking a single set of conditions year round__as opposed to changing from one ecological regime to another. Seasonal differences in habitat use by migratory birds are well known. However a recent study demonstrated that one austral migrant species Swainsons Flycatcher (Myiarchus swainsoni) tracks a consistent temperature regime in its seasonal movements through the year. That result suggests an interesting aspect of migratory behavior: species seasonal movements may be predictable on the basis of climate with species effectively tracking a single climate regime (a climatic niche) through the course of the year (much more precisely than simply tracking summer like conditions year round). With the approach having been tested on only a single species and without sufficient sample sizes to permit rigorous statistical tests in that example we are unable to determine the generality of niche tracking as opposed to niche switching. If different aspects of species seasonal movements reflect conservatism in ecological characteristics versus seasonal differences conserved patterns may greatly inform related issues such as directionality of change ancestral distributional areas and others that are key for understanding features of the evolution of migration. Here we extend the initial evaluation of tracking of seasonal conditions in migratory birds to a broad sample of Nearctic Neotropical species in the context of coarse scale ecological niches of species. We follow Grinnells geographic view of ecological niches defining them as suites of ecological conditions within which a species can maintain populations without immigration. Because our point of view is essentially geographic our niche models are necessarily cast in dimensions that are manifested at broad spatial scales  climate and topography) although niches clearly have additional dimensions at finer spatial scales. In a number of contexts models of ecological niches developed in pure auto ecological dimensions__excluding both biological interactions and spatial variables that link the niche to particular places on Earth__have been shown to provide excellent predictability regarding many complex phenomena of biodiversity. Here we model ecological niches for single species in different seasons and assess degree of coincidence among seasonal ecological niches. We identify species that track a single climatic niche among seasons__in contrast to others that appear to switch niche conditions. Our results demonstrate additional complexity in the evolution of avian migratory systems and in their current diversity.  1654:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper is a brief summary of a talk that was designed to address the question of whether two of the pillars of the field of phase transitions and critical phenomena scale invariance and universally can be useful in guiding research on a broad class of complex phenomena. We shall see that while scale invariance has been tested for many years universality is relatively more rarely discussed. In particular we shall develop a heuristic argument that serves to make more plausible the universality hypothesis in both thermal critical phenomena and percolation phenomena and suggest that this argument could be developed into a possible coherent approach to understanding the ubiquity of scale invariance and universality in a wide range of complex systems. 1659:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent advances in allometric theory have proposed a novel quantitative framework by which to view the evolution of plant form and function. This general theory has placed strong emphasis on the importance of long distance transport in shaping the evolution of many attributes of plant form and function. Specifically it is hypothesized that with the evolutionary increase in plant size natural selection has also resulted in vascular networks that minimize scaling of total hydrodynamic resistance associated with increasing transport distances. Herein the central features of this theory are reviewed and a broad sampling of supporting but yet preliminary empirical data are analysed. In particular subtle attributes of the scaling of tracheid and vessel anatomy are hypothesized to be crucial for the evolution of increased plant size. Furthermore the importance of minimizing hydrodynamic resistance associated with increased transport distances is also hypothesized to be reflected in an isometric scaling relationship between stem mass M(S) and root mass M(R)  M(S) proportional to M(R)). Preliminary data from multiple extant and fossil plant taxa provide tantalizing evidence supporting the predicted relationships. Together these results suggest that selection for the minimization of the scaling of hydrodynamic resistance within plant vascular networks has in turn allowed for the enormous diversification in vascular plant size. 1675:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most empirical and theoretical studies have shown that sex increases the rate of evolution although evidence of sex constraining genomic and epigenetic variation and slowing down evolution also exists. Faster rates with sex have been attributed to new gene combinations removal of deleterious mutations and adaptation to heterogeneous environments. Slower rates with sex have been attributed to removal of major genetic rearrangements the cost of finding a mate vulnerability to predation and exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. Whether sex speeds or slows evolution the connection between reproductive mode the evolutionary rate and species diversity remains largely unexplored. Here we present a spatially explicit model of ecological and evolutionary dynamics based on DNA sequence change to study the connection between mutation speciation and the resulting biodiversity in sexual and asexual populations. We show that faster speciation can decrease the abundance of newly formed species and thus decrease long term biodiversity. In this way sex can reduce diversity relative to asexual populations because it leads to a higher rate of production of new species but with lower abundances. Our results show that reproductive mode and the mechanisms underlying it can alter the link between mutation evolutionary rate speciation and biodiversity and we suggest that a high rate of evolution may not be required to yield high biodiversity. 1676:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most empirical studies support a decline in speciation rates through time although evidence for constant speciation rates also exists. Declining rates have been explained by invoking pre existing niches whereas constant rates have been attributed to non adaptive processes such as sexual selection and mutation. Trends in speciation rate and the processes underlying it remain unclear representing a critical information gap in understanding patterns of global diversity. Here we show that the temporal trend in the speciation rate can also be explained by frequency dependent selection. We construct a frequency dependent and DNA sequence based model of speciation. We compare our model to empirical diversity patterns observed for cichlid fish and Darwins finches two classic systems for which speciation rates and richness data exist. Negative frequency dependent selection predicts well both the declining speciation rate found in cichlid fish and explains their species richness. For groups like the Darwins finches in which speciation rates are constant and diversity is lower speciation rate is better explained by a model without frequency dependent selection. Our analysis shows that differences in diversity may be driven by incipient species abundance with frequency dependent selection. Our results demonstrate that genetic distance based speciation and frequency dependent selection are sufficient to explain the high diversity observed in natural systems and importantly predict decay through time in speciation rate in the absence of pre existing niches. 1712:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Wolbachia is a genus of bacterial endosymbionts that impacts the breeding systems of their hosts. Wolbachia can confuse the patterns of mitochondrial variation including DNA barcodes because it influences the pathways through which mitochondria are inherited. We examined the extent to which these endosymbionts are detected in routine DNA barcoding assessed their impact upon the insect sequence divergence and identification accuracy and considered the variation present in Wolbachia COI. Using both standard PCR assays (Wolbachia surface coding protein wsp) and bacterial COI fragments we found evidence of Wolbachia in insect total genomic extracts created for DNA barcoding library construction. When  2 million insect COI trace files were examined on the Barcode of Life Datasystem (BOLD) Wolbachia COI was present in 0.16 PeRcEnT of the cases. It is possible to generate Wolbachia COI using standard insect primers; however that amplicon was never confused with the COI of the host. Wolbachia alleles recovered were predominantly Supergroup A and were broadly distributed geographically and phylogenetically. We conclude that the presence of the Wolbachia DNA in total genomic extracts made from insects is unlikely to compromise the accuracy of the DNA barcode library; in fact the ability to query this DNA library (the database and the extracts) for endosymbionts is one of the ancillary benefits of such a large scale endeavor for which we provide several examples. It is our conclusion that regular assays for Wolbachia presence and type can and should be adopted by large scale insect barcoding initiatives. While COI is one of the five multi locus sequence typing (MLST) genes used for categorizing Wolbachia there is limited overlap with the eukaryotic DNA barcode region. 1719:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Forests grasslands and other plant communities often contain large numbers of plant species; in the extreme over a thousand tree species may be present in a single square kilometer of tropical forest. Ecologists have long sought to understand what factors govern the array of plant species present in any particular area and indeed how so many species can coexist at all given that all plants require essentially the same resources: light water and nutrients. The classical explanation is that species can coexist if they are sufficiently different in their niches the particular habitats or conditions in which they thrive or in the resources they exploit and have corresponding weaknesses in other areas so that no one species is able to outcompete the others. In this view species composition of a community essentially reflects which niches are available. Alternatively some ecologists have argued that chance events of immigration local extinction and speciation play a dominant role in determining which species are present in a community so that species composition essentially drifts. Empirical studies have demonstrated the importance of both sets of processes: there are meaningful differences among plant species in competitive ability under varying conditions and yet historical factors are also involved in determining whether a species that could thrive in an area is actually present. A full understanding of plant communities thus requires consideration of both niche and drift related factors as well as of both evolutionary and ecological forces. Such an integrated approach is attempted by Uriarte and Reeve in this issue of PNAS in their theoretical study of the conditions for long term ecological and evolutionary stability of coexisting plant species. Previous studies often focused exclusively on ecological stability that is on the conditions under which species can coexist indefinitely provided that each species is unchanging (does not evolve). As Uriarte and Reeve point out however traits important to competitive ability and thereby to coexistence are variable and subject to evolutionary change; thus evolutionary as well as ecological stability is required for long term stable species coexistence what Uriarte and Reeve term species marriage. The set of trait values of a species is said to be evolutionarily stable if in a population where most individuals have this set of traits a mutant individual having any other set of traits is disadvantaged; thus the traits of the species do not change over time.  1726:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coevolution has long been considered a major force leading to the adaptive radiation and diversification of insects and plants. A fundamental aspect of coevolution is that adaptations and counteradaptations interlace in time. A discordant origin of traits long before or after the origin of the putative coevolutionary selective pressure must be attributed to other evolutionary processes. Despite the importance of this distinction to our understanding of coevolution the macroevolutionary tempo of innovation in plant defenses and insect counterdefenses has not been documented. Molecular clocks for a lineage of chrysomelid beetles of the genus Blepharida and their Burseraceae hosts were independently calibrated. Results show that these plants defenses and the insects counterdefensive feeding traits evolved roughly in synchrony providing macroevolutionary confirmation of synchronous plant herbivore coadaptation. The association between these two groups of organisms was determined to be about 112 million years old the oldest age so far for a specialized plant herbivore association. 1733:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species niche a population should persist without immigration from external sources whereas if conditions are outside the niche it faces extinction. Analyses of species niches are essential to understanding controls on species geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinsons niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments the density dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species niches from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche. 1743:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Latitudinal gradients of biodiversity and macroevolutionary dynamics are prominent yet poorly understood. We derive a model that quantifies the role of kinetic energy in generating biodiversity. The model predicts that rates of genetic divergence and speciation are both governed by metabolic rate and therefore show the same exponential temperature dependence (activation energy of approximate to 0.65 eV; 1 eV equals 1.602 x 10( 19) J). Predictions are supported by global datasets from planktonic foraminifera for rates of DNA evolution and speciation spanning 30 million years. As predicted by the model rates of speciation increase toward the tropics even after controlling for the greater ocean coverage at tropical latitudes. Our model and results indicate that individual metabolic rate is a primary determinant of evolutionary rates: approximate to 10(13) J of energy flux per gram of tissue generates one substitution per nucleotide in the nuclear genome and approximate to 10(23) J of energy flux per population generates a new species of foraminifera. 1784:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We used correlated divergence analysis to determine which factors have been most closely associated with changes in seed mass during seed plant evolution. We found that divergences in seed mass have been more consistently associated with divergences in growth form than with divergences in any other variable. This finding is consistent with the strong relationship between seed mass and growth form across present day species and with the available data from the paleobotanical literature. Divergences in seed mass have also been associated with divergences in latitude net primary productivity temperature precipitation and leaf area index. However these environmental variables had much less explanatory power than did plant traits such as seed dispersal syndrome and plant growth form. 1805:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, It is widely agreed that the flowers of hermaphrodite plants evolve in response to selection acting simultaneously through male and female sexual functions but we know very little about the pattern of gender specific selection. We review three current hypotheses for gender specific selection by viewing them within a single phenotypic selection framework. We compile data from phenotypic selection and manipulative studies and evaluate the fit between empirical data and the hypotheses. In this preliminary analysis we find that neither the male function hypothesis nor the gender balance hypothesis is well supported. However the context dependence hypothesis is supported by the documented diversity of gender specific selection and by evidence that selection through female fertility is significantly correlated with pollen limitation of seed production. Future studies contributing to our understanding of selection through male and female function in plants need to quantify and manipulate the ecological context for reproduction as well as describe male and female fitness responses to fine scale trait manipulation. 1810:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many of the dynamic properties of coevolution may occur at the level of interacting populations with local adaptation acting as a force of diversification as migration between populations homogenizes these isolated interactions. This interplay between local adaptation and migration may be particularly important in structuring interactions that vary from mutualism to antagonism across the range of an interacting set of species such as those between some plants and their insect herbivores mammals and trypanosome parasites and bacteria and plasmids that confer antibiotic resistance. Here we present a simple geographically structured genetic model of a coevolutionary interaction that varies between mutualism and antagonism among communities linked by migration. Inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow alters the outcomes of local interactions and allows the maintenance of allelic polymorphism across all communities under a range of selection intensities and rates of migration. Furthermore inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow allows fu;ed mutualisms to be evolutionarily stable within both communities! even when selection on the interaction is antagonistic within one community. Moreover the model demonstrates that the inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow may lead to considerable local maladaptation and trait mismatching as predicted by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. 1815:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Previous studies of adaptive evolution in sink habitats (in which isolated populations of a species cannot persist deterministically) have highlighted the importance of demographic constraints in slowing such evolution and of immigration in facilitating adaptation. These studies have relied upon either single locus models or deterministic quantitative genetic formulations. We use individual based simulations to examine adaptive evolution in a black hole sink environment where fitness is governed by a polygenic character. The simulations track both the number of individuals and their multi locus genotypes and incorporate in a natural manner both demographic and genetic stochastic processes. In agreement with previous studies our findings reveal the central parts played by demographic constraints and immigration in adaptation within a sink (adaptation is more difficult in environments with low absolute fitness and higher immigration can accelerate adaptation). A novel finding is that there is a punctuational pattern in adaptive evolution in sink environments. Populations typically stay maladapted for a long time and then rapidly shift into a relatively adapted state in which persistence no longer depends upon recurrent immigration. 1820:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The diversity and composition of biological communities might often depend on colonization history because early colonists can exclude future colonists through a priority effect. These priority effects which have been observed across a wide variety of ecosystems often arise because early colonists have sufficient time to use available resources efficiently and subsequently withhold them from invaders. Here we explore the extent to which rapid local adaptive evolution contributes to the pervasiveness of these priority effects. Using an individual based simulation we show that early colonization allows the descendants of colonists to adapt to novel conditions and reduce the establishment success of an initially ecologically equivalent competing species. Our model predicts that slight differences in colonization timing and adaptive capacity between species can substantially alter the dynamics and diversity of communities. We also show that priority effects and gene flow can generate a novel mechanism for the expansion and retraction of species distributions in a metacommunity. Our results suggest that local adaptation combined with stochastic colonization events can obscure direct relationships between species distributions and environmental gradients. Given the increasing recognition of rapid microgeographic evolution in natural populations we expect that evolutionary priority effects could affect the structure and dynamics of many natural metacommunities. 1821:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The evolution of migration has long been considered complex and recent work has demonstrated additional complexity: some species follow the same ecological conditions throughout the year whereas others switch niches between breeding and wintering ranges. Hypotheses regarding the evolution of migration would generally predict niche following as primitive and niche switching as derived. However no test has to our knowledge yet determined the directionality of evolution of these states within a lineage. We present an analysis of phylogenetic dimensions of seasonal niches in the Passerina buntings that indicates greater evolutionary change in the niches of breeding populations than among those of wintering populations. These results are consistent with hypotheses of (i) niche conservatism (in winter at least) across a recently speciated lineage; and (ii) the derived state of the breeding (rather than winter) ecological niches of each species. 1829:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Understanding the mechanisms underlying ecological specialization is central to our understanding of community ecology and evolution. Although theoretical work has investigated how variable environments may affect specialization in single species little is known about how such variation impacts bipartite network structure in antagonistically coevolving systems. Here we develop and analyse a general model of victim enemy coevolution that explicitly includes resource and population dynamics. We investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects the evolution of specialization and associated community structure. Environmental productivity influences victim investment in resistance which will shape patterns of specialization through its regulating effect on enemy investment in infectivity. We also investigate the epidemiological consequences of environmental variability and show that enemy population density is maximized for intermediate lengths of productive seasons which corresponds to situations where enemies can evolve higher infectivity than victims can evolve defence. We discuss our results in the light of empirical studies and further highlight ways in which our model applies to a range of natural systems. 1836:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species are defined using a variety of different operational techniques. Mile discussion of the various methodologies has previously been restricted mostly to taxonomists the demarcation of species is also crucial for conservation biology. Unfortunately different methods of diagnosing species can arrive at different entities. Most prominently it is widely thought that use of a phylogenetic species concept may lead to recognition of afar greater number of much less inclusive units. As a result studies of the same group of organisms can produce not only different species identities but also different species range and number of individuals. To assess the impact of different definitions on conservation issues we collected instances from the literature where a group of organisms was categorized both under phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic concepts. Our results show a marked difference with surveys based on a phylogenetic species concept showing more species (48 PeRcEnT) and an associated decrease in population size and range. We discuss the serious consequences of this trend for conservation including an apparent change in the number of endangered species potential political fallout and the difficulty of deciding what should be conserved. 183:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1854:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, New populational approaches to the study of coevolution among species are confronting two major problems: the geographic scale at which coevolution proceeds and the long standing issue of how species may coevolve with more than one other species. By incorporating the ecological structure of life histories and populations into analyses of the coevolutionary process these studies are indicating that coevolutionary change is much more ecologically dynamic than indicated by earlier work. Rather than simply a slow stately process shaping species over long periods of time parts of the coevolutionary process may proceed rapidly (sometimes observable in less than a decade) continually molding and remolding populations and communities locally and over broad geographic scales. 1865:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The paper proposes a model for measuring and valuing biodiversity based On evolutionary information. called the phylogenetic tree model. While avoiding the strong restrictions of Weitzmans Quart. J. Econ. 107 (1992) 363   cladistic   approach the phylogenetic tree model retains much of the mathematical simplicity of the cladistic model. In particular in the phylogenetic tree model the diversity of any set of species can be recursively determined from the pairwise dissimilarities between them. The restrictions imposed by the phylogenetic tree model oil the underlying dissimilarity metric are characterized and shown to be weaker than those entailed by the cladistic model. An especially parsimonous version of the phylogenetic tree model is obtained by invoking an appropriate notion of translation invariance. 1929:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Communities arising through adaptive radiation are generally regarded as unique with speciation and adaptation being quite different from immigration and ecological assortment. Here I use the chronological arrangement of the Hawaiian Islands to visualize snapshots of evolutionary history and stages of community assembly. Analysis of an adaptive radiation of habitat associated polychromatic spiders shows that (i) species assembly is not random; (ii) within any community similar sets of ecomorphs arise through both dispersal and evolution; and (iii) species assembly is dynamic with maximum species numbers in communities of intermediate age. The similar patterns of species accumulation through evolutionary and ecological processes suggest universal principles underlie community assembly. 1945:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Identification of general properties of evolutionary radiations has been hindered by the lack of a general statistical and phylogenetic approach applicable across diverse taxa. We present a comparative analytical framework for examining phylogenetic patterns of diversification and morphological disparity with data from four iguanian lizard taxa that exhibit substantially different patterns of evolution. Taxa whose diversification occurred disproportionately early in their evolutionary history partition more of their morphological disparity among rather than within subclades. This inverse relationship between timing of diversification and morphological disparity within subclades may be a general feature that transcends the historically contingent properties of different evolutionary radiations. 1946:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Improved phylogenies and the accumulation of broad comparative data sets have opened the way for phylogenetic analyses to trace trait evolution in major groups of organisms. We arrayed seed mass data for 12 987 species on the seed plant phylogeny and show the history of seed size from the emergence of the angiosperms through to the present day. The largest single contributor to the present day spread of seed mass was the divergence between angiosperms and gymnosperms whereas the widest divergence was between Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae. Wide divergences in seed size were more often associated with divergences in growth form than with divergences in dispersal syndrome or latitude. Cross species studies and evolutionary theory are consistent with this evidence that growth form and seed size evolve in a coordinated manner. 1948:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Interactions between species are as evolutionarily malleable as the species themselves and have played a central role in the diversification and organization of life. This malleability creates complex geographic mosaics in interspecific interactions that can evolve rapidly over decades blurring the distinction between evolutionary time and ecological time and making the study of coevolution crucial for human health and welfare. 1956:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phylogenies provide new ways to measure biodiversity to assess conservation priorities and to quantify the evolutionary history in any set of species. Methodological problems and a lack of knowledge about most species have so far hampered their use. In the future as techniques improve and more data become accessible we will have an expanded set of conservation options including ways to prioritize outcomes from evolutionary and ecological processes. 1968:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The hierarchical nature of phylogenies means that random extinction of species affects a smaller fraction of higher taxa and so the total amount of evolutionary history lost may be comparatively slight. However current extinction risk is not phylogenetically random. We show the potentially severe implications of the clumped nature of threat for the loss of biodiversity. An additional 120 avian and mammalian genera are at risk compared with the number predicted under random extinction. We estimate that the prospective extra Loss of mammalian evolutionary history alone would be equivalent to Losing a monotypic phylum. 1994:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In a recent article Gatesy . assessed different methods of creating phylogenies of even toed ungulates (Artiodactyla) and whales (Cetacea; together the Cetartiodactyla) from compilations of data. Gatesy . criticized strongly an analysis by Liu . that combined separate estimates of phylogeny to yield a phylogenetic supertree rather than using primary character data  molecular sequences) to infer the phylogeny. The main criticisms that Gatesy . raised about the Liu . analysis are of data duplication poor data quality and data accountability. They claimed that these problems biased the Liu . supertree analysis such that support for any particular node . . . may have little or no empirical basis meaning that the supertree should not be used to guide future phylogenetic research or to organize comparative evolutionary studies. Although it was not their intent it is easy to interpret Gatesy .s criticisms as applying to the supertree approach in general with the implication that analysis of the primary character data especially when combined in a supermatrix approach is the only valid method for phylogeny reconstruction. Given the growing use of supertree methods for constructing phylogenies of large clades of organisms it is important to assess this approach in general in light of Gatesy .s comments on the Liu . analysis. In our opinion most of the problems identified can be ameliorated with a well conceived protocol for selecting the source phylogenies with which to build the supertree. Many of the issues raised by Gatesy . have already been addressed by individual supertree studies. Here we outline our protocol for selecting source trees as well as point out some analytical advantages that the supertree approach possesses over the supermatrix approach. In so doing we establish that supertree construction represents a viable and valid alternative to supermatrix analyses.  1995:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Geographic characters traits describing the spatial distribution of a species may both affect and be affected by processes associated with lineage birth and death. This is potentially confounding to comparative analyses of species distributions because current models do not allow reciprocal interactions between the evolution of ranges and the growth of phylogenetic trees. Here we introduce a likelihood based approach to estimating region dependent rates of speciation extinction and range evolution from a phylogeny using a new model in which these processes are interdependent. We demonstrate the method with simulation tests that accurately recover parameters relating to the mode of speciation and source sink dynamics. We then apply it to the evolution of habitat occupancy in Californian plant communities where we find higher rates of speciation in chaparral than in forests and evidence for expanding habitat tolerances. 1997:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The current infrafamilial taxonomy of the Iridaceae recognizes four subfamilies Isophysidoideae (1:1); Nivenioideae (6: ca. 92) Iridoideae (29: 890) and Crocoideae (29: 1032). Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of five plastid DNA regions rbcL rps4 trnL F matK and rps16 confirm most aspects of this classification and the evolutionary patterns that they imply importantly the sisiter relationship of Isophysidoideae to the remainder of the family and the monophyly of Iridoideae. Subfamily Nivenioideae is however paraphyletic; Crocoideae is consistently found nested within it sister to the core Nivenioideae the woody Klattia Nivenia and Witsenia. This clade is sister to Aristea which in turn is sister to the Madagascan Geosiris and then to the Australasian Patersonia. We treat Aristea Geosiris and Patersonia as separate subfamilies Aristeoideae and the new Geosiridaceae and Patersonioideae rendering Nivenioideae and Crocoideae monophyletic. The alternative uniting a widely circumscribed Nivenioideae and Crocoideae seems undesirable because Nivenioideae have none of the numerous synapomorphies of Crocoideae and that subfamily includes more than half the total species of Iridaceae. Main synapomorphies of Crocoideae are; pollen operculate; exine perforate; ovule campylotropous; root xylem vessels with simple perfortions; rootstock a corm; inflorescence usually a spike; plants deciduous. Four more derived features of Crocoideae are shared only with core Nivenioideae: flowers long lived; perianth tube well developed; flowers sessile; and septal nectaries present. The genera of the latter subfamily are evergreen shrubs have monocot type secondary growth tangentially flattened seeds and the inflorescence unit is a binate rhipidium. The latter feature unites core Niveniodeae with Aristea Geosiris and Patersonia which have fugaceous flowers and with few exceptions a blue perianth. Moleculardeae the foundation for the tribal classification. The five tribe classification of Iridoideae initially based on morphological charactes and subsequently supported by a four plastid DNA region sequence analysis continues to receive support using additional DNA sequences. Application of molecular clock techniques to our phylogeny indicates that the Iridaceae differentiated in the late Cretaceous and diverged from the next most closely related family. Doryanthaceae circa 82 mya thus during the Campanian. The Tasmanian Isophysis is the only extant member of the clade sister to the remainder of the Iridaceae from which it may have diverged 66 mya in the Maastrichtian. The generic phylogeny shows the proximal clades of the family are all Australian which corroborates past hypothese that the Iridaceae originated in Antarctica Australasia although its subsequent radiation occured elsewhere notably in southern Africa and temperate and highland South America at the end of the Eocene or later. 2004:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many autotrophs vary their allocation to nutrient uptake in response to environmental cues yet the dynamics of this plasticity are largely unknown. Plasticity dynamics affect the extent of single versus multiple nutrient limitation and thus have implications for plant ecology and biogeochemical cycling. Here we use a model of two essential nutrients cycling through autotrophs and the environment to determine conditions under which different plastic or fixed nutrient uptake strategies are adaptive. Our model includes environment independent costs of being plastic environment dependent costs proportional to the rate of plastic change and costs of being mismatched to the environment the last of which is experienced by both fixed and plastic types. In equilibrium environments environment independent costs of being plastic select for tortoise strategies fixed or less plastic types provided that they are sufficiently close to co limitation. At intermediate levels of environmental fluctuation forced by periodic nutrient inputs more hare like plastic strategies prevail because they remain near co limitation. However the fastest is not necessarily the best. The most adaptive strategy is an intermediate level of plasticity that keeps pace with environmental fluctuations but is not faster. At high levels of environmental fluctuation the environment dependent cost of changing rapidly to keep pace with the environment becomes prohibitive and tortoise strategies again dominate. The existence and location of these thresholds depend on plasticity costs and rate which are largely unknown empirically. These results suggest that the expectations for single nutrient limitation versus co limitation and therefore biogeochemical cycling and autotroph community dynamics depend on environmental heterogeneity and plasticity costs. 2010:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A population dynamical model describing growth of bacteria on two substrates is analyzed. The model assumes that bacteria choose substrates in order to maximize their per capita population growth rate. For batch bacterial growth the model predicts that as the concentration of the preferred substrate decreases there will be a time at which both substrates provide bacteria with the same fitness and both substrates will be used simultaneously thereafter. Preferences for either substrate are computed as a function of substrate concentrations. The predicted time of switching is calculated for some experimental data given in the literature and it is shown that the fit between predicted and observed values is good. For bacterial growth in the chemostat the model predicts that at low dilution rates bacteria should feed on both substrates while at higher dilution rates bacteria should feed on the preferred substrate only. Adaptive use of substrates permits bacteria to survive in the chemostat at higher dilution rates when compared with non adaptive bacteria. 201:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  The increasing availability of phylogenetic and trait data for communities of co occurring species has created a need for software that integrates ecological and evolutionary analyses.

However recent ESU concepts coupled with increasing availability of data on neutral genetic variation have led to criteria based exclusively on molecular phylogenies. We argue that the earlier definitions of ESUs which incorporated ecological data and genetic variation of adaptive significance are more relevant for conservation Furthermore this dichotomous summary (ESU or not) of a continuum of population differentiation is not adequate for determining appropriate management actions. We argue for a broader categorization of population distinctiveness based on concepts of ecological and genetic exchangeability (sensu Templeton). 2039:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Exotic species invasions create almost ideal conditions for promoting evolutionary diversification: establishment of allopatric populations in new environmental conditions; altered ecological opportunities for native species; and new opportunities for hybridization between previously allopatric taxa. Here we review recent studies of the evolutionary consequences of species invasions revealing abundant and widespread examples of exotic species promoting evolutionary diversification via increased genetic differentiation among populations of both exotic and native species and the creation of new hybrid lineages. Our review indicates that although the well documented reductions to biodiversity caused by exotic species might outweigh the increases resulting from diversification a complete understanding of the net effects of exotic species on biodiversity in the long term will require consideration of both. 2052:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phenotypic plasticity is widespread in nature and often involves ecologically relevant behavioral physiological morphological and life historical traits. As a result plasticity alters numerous interactions between organisms and their abiotic and biotic environments. Although much work on plasticity has focused on its patterns of expression and evolution researchers are increasingly interested in understanding how plasticity can affect ecological patterns and processes at various levels. Here we highlight an expanding body of work that examines how plasticity can affect all levels of ecological organization through effects on demographic parameters direct and indirect species interactions such as competition predation and coexistence and ultimately carbon and nutrient cycles. 2057:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Rapid evolution of interspecific interactions (during a timespan of about 100 years) has the potential to be an important influence on the ecological dynamics of communities. However despite the growing number of examples rapid evolution is still not a standard working hypothesis for many ecological studies on the dynamics of population structure or the organization of communities. Analysis of rapid evolution as an ecological process has the potential to make evolutionary ecology one of the most central of applied biological sciences. 2062:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Research on the interactions between evolutionary and ecological dynamics has largely focused on local spatial scales and on relatively simple ecological communities. However recent work demonstrates that dispersal can drastically alter the interplay between ecological and evolutionary dynamics often in unexpected ways. We argue that a dispersal centered synthesis of metacommunity ecology and evolution is necessary to make further progress in this important area of research. We demonstrate that such an approach generates several novel outcomes and substantially enhances understanding of both ecological and evolutionary phenomena in three core research areas at the interface of ecology and evolution. 213:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Here we review growing evidence that microevolutionary changes may often be rapid and in many cases occur on time frames comparable to human disturbance and anthropogenic change. Contemporary evolutionary change has been documented in relatively pristine habitats in disturbed populations under captive management and in association with both intentional and inadvertent introductions. We argue that evolutionary thinking is thus relevant to conservation biology and resource management but has received insufficient consideration. Ignoring evolution may have a variety of consequences including unpredicted evolutionary responses to disturbance and naive or inappropriate management decisions. Philosophically we must also grapple with the issue of whether the evolution of adaptations to disturbance and degraded habitats is sometimes beneficial or something to be rigorously avoided. We advocate promoting evolutionarily enlightened management Lecture Notes in Biomathematics 99 (1994) 248 in which both the ecological and evolutionary consequences of resource management decisions are considered. 21:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many oak species are interfertile and morphological and genetic evidence for hybridization is widespread. Here we use DNA microsatellite markers to characterize hybridization between two closely related oak species in a mixed stand in central coastal California. Quercus lobata (valley oak) and Q. douglasii (blue oak) (Fagaceae). Genotypes from four microsatellite loci indicate that many alleles are shared between the two species. However each species harbors unique alleles and allele frequencies differ significantly. A Bayesian analysis of genetic structure in the stand identified two highly differentiated genetic clusters essentially corresponding to species assignment based on morphology. Data from the four loci were sufficient to assign all 135 trees to one of the two species. In addition five putative hybrid individuals having intermediate morphologies could be assigned genetically to one or the other species and all but one had low probability of hybrid ancestry. Overally only six (4.6 PeRcEnT) trees showed  0.05 probability of hybrid ancestry in all cases their probabilities for nonhybrid ancestry were substantially higher. We conclude that adult hybrids of Q. douglasii X Q. lobata are rare at this site and plasticity in morphological characters may lead to overestimates of hybridization among Quercus species. 230:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Aphelocoma jays have become an important touchstone in behavioural ecology and biogeography the corpus of studies of this genus makes it an important point of reference. Aphelocoma evolutionary history nevertheless has been the subject of two papers reaching opposite conclusions even though they were based on the same allozyme data set. Herein we present a second molecular data set 500 bases of the ND2 gene and analyse it cladistically to arrive at a new hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships. Recent hypotheses by other investigators of a hybrid origin of Aphelocoma populations are strongly contradicted. The ecological context within which these evolutionary processes are taking place is characterized using new tools for modelling ecological niches of species along a spectrum from humid tropical to dry temperate habitats. Evolutionary patterns of ecological niches are shown to consist of drastic departures from rate uniformity and ecological niche conservatism. 232:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecophylogenetics can be viewed as an emerging fusion of ecology biogeography and macroevolution. This new and fast growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution. This is a necessary step in order to interpret observed phylogenetic patterns in a wider ecological context. Beyond the fundamental question of how evolutionary history contributes to shape communities ecophylogenetics will help ecology to become a better integrative and predictive science. 234:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,239:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Since the modern evolutionary synthesis was first proposed early in the twentieth century attention has focused on assessing the relative contribution of mutation versus natural selection on protein evolution. Here we test a model that yields general quantitative predictions on rates of protein evolution by combining principles of individual energetics with Kimuras neutral theory. The model successfully predicts much of the heterogeneity in rates of protein evolution for diverse eukaryotes ( fishes amphibians reptiles birds mammals) from different thermal environments. Data also show that the ratio of non synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution is independent of body size and thus presumably of effective population size. These findings indicate that rates of protein evolution are largely controlled by mutation rates which in turn are strongly influenced by individual metabolic rate. 247:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,248:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,250:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological research is entering a new era of integration and collaboration as we meet the challenge of understanding the great complexity of biological systems. Ecological sub disciplines are rapidly combining and incorporating other biological physical mathematical and sociological disciplines. The burgeoning base of theoretical and empirical work made possible by new methods technologies and funding opportunities is providing the opportunity to reach robust answers to major ecological questions. In December 1999 the National Science Foundation convened a white paper committee to evaluate what we know and do not know about important ecological processes what hurdles currently hamper our progress and what intellectual and conceptual interfaces need to be encouraged. The committee distilled the discussion into four frontiers in research on the ecological structure of the earths biological diversity and the ways in which ecological processes continuously shape that structure  ecological dynamics). This article summarizes the discussions of those frontiers and explains why they are crucial to our understanding of how ecological processes shape patterns and dynamics of global biocomplexity. The frontiers are Dynamics of coalescence in complex communities Evolutionary and historical determinants of ecological processes: The role of ecological memory Emergent properties of complex systems: Biophysical constraints and evolutionary attractors Ecological topology: Defining the spatiotemporal domains of causality for ecological structure and processes Each of the four research frontiers takes a different approach to the overall ecological dynamics of biocomplexity and all require integration and collaboration among those approaches. These overlapping frontiers themselves are not necessarily new. Within each frontier however are emerging questions and approaches that will help us understand how ecological processes are interconnected over multiple spatial and temporal scales from local community structure to global patterns.  254:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Microbial ecology is undergoing a revolution of phenomenological discoveries and methodological advances that bring resolution down toward the level of the individual and highlight the role of chemical exchanges in bacterial communities. Recent work shows that inter and intraspecific chemical signaling leading to coordinated density dependent behavior (termed quorum sensing) is commonplace among bacterial species and is relevant in natural habitats. Density dependent phenomena first identified in bioluminescence where the induced behavior is visible have since been implicated in general foraging and defensive behaviors such as production of extracellular enzymes and antibiotics. An additional development is the recognition of the tremendous importance of surface attached bacteria in nature. Increased acquisition of nutrients has been proposed as one explanation for attachment. Surfaces are also habitats for microbial consortia or groups of bacterial species whose interdependent metabolic reactions are required for the decomposition of certain complex substrates. Improvements in molecular techniques for identifying taxa phylogenetic relationships and differential genotypic and phenotypic expression are accelerating. It is arguable that measurement capability has surpassed predictive expertise particularly at the clonal level. Other authors have hypothesized that evolutionary processes operating at multiple taxonomic levels result in widespread cooperative behavior in bacteria as exemplified by quorum sensing. Coevolution has been proposed to explain the close associations among consortial bacteria. In contrast to the progress being made in empirical microbial ecology few theoretical treatments of these topics exist. An exciting result of the rapid progress in microbial ecology is that methodologies and incentives now exist to treat bacteria like larger  easier to visualize) organisms gaining from the application of existing general ecological theory to microbial problems. General ecology on the other hand is poised to benefit from applying such theory to microbial systems. Bacteria can be modeled almost perfectly in terms of morphologies motilities and growth and they can be tested experimentally with billions of organisms and over many generations. One major difficulty is predicting performance of bacterial individuals a key step in gaining understanding of most metazoans. For example the relationships between individual foraging and local habitat are central to predicting the abundance of organisms in time and space. Additionally quantifying the relationships between fitness and genetic relatedness is essential for understanding the evolution of cooperation. For bacteria which are 0.2 2.0 m in diameter and are often studied in samples of 105 109 organisms these relationships have been difficult to elucidate. Theoretical treatments have thus far been limited to individual organisms and simple geometries. Here we quantify foraging by individual attached bacteria in those porous media where mass transport is dominated by diffusion. In particular we focus on surficial marine sediments where 99.9 PeRcEnT of bacteria are attached to grain surfaces forming sparse biofilms. Specifically we quantify the cost of attachment in the currency of nutrient uptake and given attachment how uptake is influenced by sediment grain microtopography. Additionally we describe the impact of near neighbor bacteria and initiate a foraging theory appropriate for clonal populations. These issues require solutions to Ficks laws of diffusion for complicated geometries (see Box 1).Analytical solutions do not exist and numerical estimates would require daunting boundary and grid specifications. Instead we implement an electrical model inspired by Bergs theoretical treatment to quantify steady state diffusive uptake by benthic bacteria. Electrical analogs based on mathematical equivalence among disparate systems were used to solve transport problems before affordable digital computing became available. Physically implemented electrical analogs had not been used previously to solve complex diffusion problems nor had they been used in ecological contexts. The method described here is accurate economical rapid and flexible. It holds promise in contemporary education as well because a hands on approach involving analogous thinking can greatly improve physical intuition particularly regarding mass and energy transfer. Developing this understanding is especially important in biology where interactions between organisms and their environments are often constrained physically. Furthermore the analogy is well suited to interdisciplinary efforts emphasizing comprehension across multiple time and space scales.  259:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,295:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  A positive relationship between diversification  speciation) and nucleotide substitution rates is commonly reported for angiosperm clades. However the underlying cause of this relationship is often unknown because multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors can affect the relationship and these have confounded previous attempts infer causation. Determining which factor drives this oft reported correlation can lend insight into the macroevolutionary process. Using a new database of 13 time calibrated angiosperm phylogenies based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and controlling for extrinsic variables of life history and habitat I evaluated several potential intrinsic causes of this correlation. Speciation rates (lambda) and relative extinction rates (epsilon) were positively correlated with mean substitution rates but were uncorrelated with substitution rate heterogeneity. It is unlikely that the positive diversification substitution correlation is due to accelerated molecular evolution during speciation (e. g. via enhanced selection or drift) because punctuated increases in ITS rate  greater mean and variation in ITS rate for rapidly speciating clades) were not observed. Instead fast molecular evolution likely increases speciation rate (via increased mutational variation as a substrate for selection and reproductive isolation) but also increases extinction (via mutational genetic load). In general these results predict that clades with higher background substitution rates may undergo successful diversification under new conditions while clades with lower substitution rates may experience decreased extinction during environmental stasis. 296:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Recent work on the complexity of life highlights the roles played by evolutionary forces at different levels of individuality. One of the central puzzles in explaining transitions in individuality for entities ranging from complex cells to multicellular organisms and societies is how different autonomous units relinquish control over their functions to others in the group. In addition to the necessity of reducing conflict over effecting specialized tasks differentiating groups must control the exploitation of the commons or else be out competed by more fit groups. We propose that two forms of conflict access to resources within groups and representation in germ line may be resolved in tandem through individual and group level selective effects. Specifically we employ an optimization model to show the conditions under which different within group social behaviors (cooperators producing a public good or cheaters exploiting the public good) may be selected to disperse thereby not affecting the commons and functioning as germ line. We find that partial or complete dispersal specialization of cheaters is a general outcome. The propensity for cheaters to disperse is highest with intermediate benefit: cost ratios of cooperative acts and with high relatedness. An examination of a range of real biological systems tends to support our theory although additional study is required to provide robust tests. We suggest that trait linkage between dispersal and cheating should be operative regardless of whether groups ever achieve higher levels of individuality because individual selection will always tend to increase exploitation and stronger group structure will tend to increase overall cooperation through kin selected benefits. Cheater specialization as dispersers offers simultaneous solutions to the evolution of cooperation in social groups and the origin of specialization of germ and soma in multicellular organisms. 29:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,321:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,355:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An increasing number of phylogenetic analyses is no longer translated into classifications. The resulting phylogeny classification gap is undesirable because the precise transmission of phylogenetic insights depends on the frequent revision of Linnaean names. The move away from classifying has numerous correlates. These include: an expanded pool of researchers who are able to produce phylogenetic estimates a mismatch between the properties of molecular phylogenies and the requirements for verbal Linnaean definitions the emphasis of statistical representations over the creation and evaluation of scientific terms and a partial disconnect between the processes of nomenclature and taxonomy. The   taxonomic concept   approach allows systematists to express their varying perspectives with a high precision and can therefore help reduce the aforementioned gap. The phylogeny classification link must persist in order to ensure community wide access to and continued testing of the products of systematic research. 35:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A model is presented to explore how the form of selection arising from competition for resources is affected by spatial resource heterogeneity. The model consists of a single species occupying two patches connected by migration where the two patches can differ in the type of resources that they contain. The main goal is to determine the conditions under which competition for resources results in disruptive selection  selection favoring a polymorphism) since it is this form of selection that will give rise to the evolutionary diversification of resource exploitation strategies. In particular comparing the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection when the two patches are identical to the conditions when they contain different resources reveals the effect of spatial resource heterogeneity. Results show that. when the patches are identical the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection are identical to those that give rise to character displacement in previous models. When the patches are different the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection can he either more or less stringent depending upon demographic parameters such as the intrinsic rate of increase and the migration rate. Surprisingly spatial resource heterogeneity can actually make forms of evolutionary diversification such as character displacement less likely. It is also found that results are dependent on how the resource exploitation strategies and the spatial resource heterogeneity affect the population dynamics. One robust conclusion however is that spatial resource heterogeneity always has a disruptive effect when the migration rate between patches is low. 390:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,406:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,407:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,44:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Animal taxa show remarkable variability in species richness across phylogenetic groups. Most explanations for this disparity postulate that taxa with more species have phenotypes or ecologies that cause higher diversification rates  higher speciation rates or lower extinction rates). Here we show that clade longevity and not diversification rate has primarily shaped patterns of species richness across major animal clades: more diverse taxa are older and thus have had more time to accumulate species. Diversification rates calculated from 163 species level molecular phylogenies were highly consistent within and among three major animal phyla ( Arthropoda Chordata Mollusca) and did not correlate with species richness. Clades with higher estimated diversification rates were younger but species numbers increased with increasing clade age. A fossil based data set also revealed a strong positive relationship between total extant species richness and crown group age across the orders of insects and vertebrates. These findings do not negate the importance of ecology or phenotype in influencing diversification rates but they do show that clade longevity is the dominant signal in major animal biodiversity patterns. Thus some key innovations may have acted through fostering clade longevity and not by heightening diversification rate. 466:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As complex traits evolve each component of the trait may be under different selection pressures and could respond independently to distinct evolutionary forces. We used comparative methods to examine patterns of evolution in multiple components of a complex courtship signal in darters specifically addressing the question of how nuptial coloration evolves across different areas of the body. Using spectral reflectance we defined 4 broad color classes present on the body and fins of 17 species of freshwater fishes (genus Etheostoma) and quantified differences in hue within each color class. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that most color traits were expressed in the most recent common ancestor of sampled species and that differences among species are mostly due to losses in coloration. The evolutionary lability of coloration varied across body regions; we found significant phylogenetic signal for orange color on the body but not for most colors on fins. Finally patterns of color evolution and hue of the colors were correlated among the two dorsal fins and between the anterior dorsal and anal fins but not between any of the fins and the body. The observed patterns support the hypothesis that different components of complex signals may be subject to distinct evolutionary pressures and suggests that the combination of behavioral displays and morphology in communication may have a strong influence on patterns of signal evolution. 46:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Asymmetrical competition determines which of two seed predators drives the evolution of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) cones. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are effective preemptive competitors in lodgepole pine forests so that red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) are uncommon and selection from Tamiasciurus drives cone evolution. When Tamiasciurus are absent crossbills increase in abundance and coevolve in an evolutionary arms race with pine. Similarly Tamiasciurus alters the evolutionary trajectories of large seeded pines many of which rely on birds (Corvidae) for their seed dispersal. Populations therefore exhibit a selection mosaic with coevolutionary hot spots. In the coevolutionary hot spots divergent selection on crossbills potentially leads to reproductive isolation and speciation. This results in a subsequent reduction in the geographic mosaic but diversifies the adaptive landscape on which crossbills have radiated. Thus divergent selection is a double edged sword. Divergent selection is critical in creating a selection mosaic but erodes the selection mosaic when it promotes reproductive isolation and speciation. 479:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Increasingly ecologists are using evolutionary relationships to infer the mechanisms of community assembly. However modern communities are being invaded by non indigenous species. Since natives have been associated with one another through evolutionary time the forces promoting character and niche divergence should be high. On the other hand exotics have evolved elsewhere meaning that conserved traits may be more important in their new ranges. Thus co occurrence over sufficient time scales for reciprocal evolution may alter how phylogenetic relationships influence assembly. Here we examined the phylogenetic structure of native and exotic plant communities across a large scale gradient in species richness and asked whether local assemblages are composed of more or less closely related natives and exotics and whether phylogenetic turnover among plots and among sites across this gradient is driven by turnover in close or distant relatives differentially for natives and exotics. Central and northern California USA. We used data from 30 to 50 replicate plots at four sites and constructed a maximum likelihood molecular phylogeny using the genes: matK rbcl ITS1 and 5.8s. We compared community level measures of native and exotic phylogenetic diversity and among plot phylobetadiversity. There were few exotic clades but they tended to be widespread. Exotic species were phylogenetically clustered within communities and showed low phylogenetic turnover among communities. In contrast the more species rich native communities showed higher phylogenetic dispersion and turnover among sites. The assembly of native and exotic subcommunities appears to reflect the evolutionary histories of these species and suggests that shared traits drive exotic patterns while evolutionary differentiation drives native assembly. Current invasions appear to be causing phylogenetic homogenization at regional scales. 487:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Successful invaders often possess similar ecological traits that contribute to success in new regions and thus under niche conservatism invader success should be phylogenetically clustered. We asked if the degree to which non native plant species are phylogenetically related is a predictor of invasion success at two spatial scales. Australia the whole continent and Royal National Park (south eastern Australia). We used non native plant species occupancy in Royal National Park as well as estimated continental occupancy of these species from herbarium records. We then estimated phylogenetic relationships using molecular data from three gene sequences available on GenBank (matK rbcL and ITS1). We tested for phylogenetic signals in occupancy using Blombergs K. Whereas most non native plants were relatively scarce there was a strong phylogenetic signal for continental occupancy driven by the clustering of successful species in Asteraceae Caryophyllaceae Poaceae and Solanaceae. However we failed to detect a phylogenetic signal at the park scale. Our results reveal that at a large spatial scale invader success is phylogenetically clustered where ecological traits promoting success appear to be shared among close relatives indicating that phylogenetic relationships can be useful predictors of invasion success at large spatial scales. At a smaller landscape scale there was no evidence of phylogenetic clustering of invasion success and thus relatedness plays a much reduced role in determining the relative success of invaders. 49:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Clades diversify in an ecological context but most macroevolutionary models do not directly encapsulate ecological mechanisms that influence speciation and extinction. A data set of 245 chordate arthropod mollusk and magnoliophyte phylogenies had a majority of clades that showed rapid lineage accumulation early with a slowing more recently whereas a small but significant minority showed accelerated lineage accumulation in their recent histories. Previous analyses have demonstrated that macroevolutionary birth death models can replicate the pattern of slowing lineage accumulation only by a strong decrease in speciation rate with increasing species richness and extinction rate held extremely low or absent. In contrast the metacommunity model presented here could generate the full range of patterns seen in the real phylogenies by simply manipulating the degree of ecological differentiation of new species at the time of speciation. Specifically the metacommunity model predicts that clades showing decelerating lineage accumulation rates are those that have diversified by ecological modes of speciation whereas clades showing accelerating lineage accumulation rates are those that have diversified primarily by modes of speciation that generate little or no ecological diversification. A number of testable predictions that integrate data from molecular systematics community ecology and biogeography are also discussed. 512:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,51:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Closely related species that occur together in communities and experience similar environmental conditions are likely to share phenotypic traits because of the process of environmental filtering. At the same time species that are too similar are unlikely to co occur because of competitive exclusion. In an effort to explain the coexistence of 17 oak species within forest communities in North Central Florida we examined correlations between the phylogenetic relatedness of oak species their degree of co occurrence within communities and niche overlap across environmental gradients and their similarity in ecophysiological and life history traits. We show that the oaks are phylogenetically overdispersed because co occurring species are more distantly related than expected by chance and oaks within the same clade show less niche overlap than expected. Hence communities are more likely to include members of both the red oak and the oak clades than only members of one clade. white live This pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion arises because traits important for habitat specialization show evolutionary convergence. We hypothesize further that certain conserved traits permit coexistence of distantly related congeners. These results provide an explanation for how oak diversity is maintained at the community level in North Central Florida. 539:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,53:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coevolution in mutualisms may result in a stable mosaic pattern of spatial differentiation with regions occupied by different coadapted pairs of mutualists each being resistant to invasion by organisms with alternative phenotypes. The evolution of geographic mosaic patterns was analyzed for symbioses of legume plants and root nodule bacteria (rhizobia) where plants are commonly polymorphic for genes affecting mutualism specificity. Typically some alleles confer broad compatibility and others restrict the set of bacterial genotypes accepted by plants as mutualist partners. Metapopulation simulation models with genetic assumptions matching the observed form of symbiotic specificity show that selection can generate a stable geographic mosaic if certain conditions are satisfied regarding competitive abilities fitness benefits from mutualism and migration rates. The structure of geographic variation in natural populations of the annual legume Amphicarpaea bracteata together with patterns of variation in symbiotic fitness is consistent with the interpretation that a mosaic pattern of differentiation may exist. Experimental and observational studies necessary to test more rigorously for mosaic distributions are outlined. 542:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,545:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,54:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coevolution is one of the major processes organizing the earths biodiversity. The need to understand coevolution as an ongoing process has grown as ecological concerns have risen over the dynamics of rapidly changing biological communities the conservation of genetic diversity and the population biology of diseases. The biggest current challenge is to understand how coevolution operates across broad geographic landscapes linking local ecological processes with phylogeographic patterns. The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution provides a framework for asking how coevolution continually reshapes interactions across different spatial and temporal scales. It produces specific hypotheses on how geographically structured coevolution differs from coevolution at the local scale. It also provides a framework for understanding how local maladaptation can result from coevolution and why coevolved interactions may rarely produce long lists of coevolved traits that become fixed within species. Long term field studies of the same interaction across multiple communities and spatially structured mathematical models are together beginning to show that coevolution may be a more important ongoing process than had been indicated by earlier empirical and theoretical studies lacking a geographic perspective. 57:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species ranges could be set intraspecifically when gene flow from a species populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldanes process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwins ideas we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific competition and the frequency dependent selection that it generates as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model includes local population growth movements over space natural selection and gene now. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further in the absence of environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However interspecific competition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry yet the reduction in competition that results from this displacement does nor necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap which in turn intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model then patterns similar to Rapoports rule emerge. Interacting species respond to climate change as it affects the optimal phenotype over space by a combination of range shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype while solitary species respond solely by range shifts. Finally we compare empirical estimates for intrinsic growth rates and diffusion coefficients for several species to those needed by the single species model to produce a stable limited range. These empirical values are generally insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model suggesting a role for interspecific interactions. 645:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In the face of rapid changes in Earths biota understanding the evolutionary processes that drive patterns of species diversity differentiation and coexistence in ecosystems globally has never been more pressing. Advances through computational methods analytical approaches long term observations and well designed experiments are essential to sustaining the complex interactions and ecosystem functions of the living world. Early naturalists seamlessly integrated ecology and evolution but lacked the tools to do so in a predictive and quantitative manner. Recent advances in computational tools and in the study of diversity gradients and community assembly have revived historical traditions integrating ecology and evolution. This work increasingly demonstrates that a legacy of evolutionary history persists in ecological patterns and processes we observe today in concert with growing evidence for rapid adaptive evolution of populations in response to recent environmental change. The body of work represented in this Special Issue is drawn from scientists working at the interface of ecology and evolution using a range of theoretical and methodological frameworks and working in a wide range of ecological systems around the globe. The papers are organized around three central themes: (1) methodological advances in the integration of phylogenetics in ecological research; (2) integration of phenotypic and phylogenetic approaches to community assembly including the role of niche evolution and diversification; and (3) studies that examine the footprint of evolutionary history in trophic interactions and ecosystem function. This collection was catalyzed by a working group sponsored by the Long Term Ecological Research Network and a subsequent working group supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. Methodological and computational advances have played a key role in the integration of phylogenetics and ecology as researchers in both fields tackle rapidly growing data sets and apply increasingly sophisticated algorithms to detect processes that drive diversity and assembly of life on Earth. Beaulieu . outline a new approach for storing and annotating published phylogenies and then building supertrees for comparative biology. Peres Neto . provide a heuristic and analytical framework for merging metacommunity ecology and community phylogenetics linking niche properties based on traits and phylogenetics to environmental and spatial variation from a metacommunity perspective. Helmus and Ives develop theoretical expectations for phylogenetic diversity area (PDA) curves under different ecological and macroevolutionary processes. They test these expectations using simulations and long term data sets and show that processes that generate and maintain biodiversity at various spatial scales including extinction colonization and within region speciation can be distinguished. Davies . introduce a new approach to the problem of inferring processes of community assembly from phylogenetic and trait based studies without reference to a particular regional species pool. They demonstrate that the observed body size distribution for a desert mammal community exhibits a distinctive signature that is not expected under background models of trait evolution. Most of the studies in this issue address community assembly niche evolution and patterns of diversity. These studies encompass a spectrum of approaches from community based studies of co occurring and potential interacting organisms to clade based studies of the evolutionary history of lineages irrespective of whether taxa currently interact. A common thread in many studies is the effort to bridge temporal dimensions linking deep evolutionary history with recent community assembly processes. The observation that related species exhibit similarities in form and function that extend to the habitats they select and the niche space they occupy plays a central role in the analysis of community assembly patterns. Yet opposing views on how the niche evolves leave open the question of when and where phylogenetic niche conservatism is important in ecological processes. Cavender Bares and Reich show that traits influencing patterns of phylogenetic beta diversity along a gradient of fire frequency may have originated as long as 80 million years ago revealing an ancient footprint of history on the ecological assembly and turnover of species. Similarly Norden . find that early successional status is conserved in Neotropical forest trees leading to consistent shifts in phylogenetic structure in the course of ecological succession. Knapp . demonstrate that urbanization causes phylogenetic and functional homogenization in spontaneous yard plant communities due to anthropogenic filters with a strong evolutionary bias that reflects niche conservatism. Other studies find more mixed evidence in terms of the patterns and consequences of niche conservatism. In Andean hummingbird communities Graham . find that the trait structure of communities cannot be consistently predicted from phylogenetic structure despite strong phylogenetic signals in functional traits. In six forests spanning tropical and temperate latitudes Swenson . find support for the role of abiotic filtering on the structure of local communities and spatial turnover in community composition but they do not find strong links between phylogenetic and functional diversity. Using an experimental approach Burns and Strauss show that trait plasticity can increase the ability of close relatives to coexist but that it also decreases the degree of phylogenetic signal in functional traits. Their study offers an intriguing explanation for why phylogenetic signal among coexisting species may decrease at smaller spatial and temporal scales. Focusing in on specific clades Savage and Cavender Bares found a shift in trait and phylogenetic structure of willow communities across a hydrologic gradient reflecting changes in community assembly processes and in the phylogenetic structure of the traits involved. In a clade of California annual plants Emery . report that local habitat niches are conserved while climatic niche axes are not. They argue that ecological specialization may be specific to certain niche axes rather than an overall characteristic of a species. And in the only study in this collection addressing patterns of species richness Kozak and Wiens ask what determines the total number of coexisting species in local and regional communities of plethodontid salamanders. They argue that variation in the amount of time that different climatic zones have been occupied is the primary factor explaining relationships between climate and diversity rather than the direct effects of climate on speciation or extinction rates or ecological saturation effects on diversification. The third group of papers examines trophic interactions including pollination and herbivory and the ecosystem consequences of species interactions. Eaton . provide evidence that plant pollinator interactions have repeatedly driven character displacement in floral traits of Pedicularis in the Hengduan biodiversity hotspot region of China and that accelerated floral divergence contributes to the remarkable accumulation of species diversity in the region. In one of several studies that apply an experimental approach Lamarre . examine plant insect interactions in Amazonian rain forest trees incorporating shared ancestry to factor out lineage effects on plant chemistry. In contrast to previous studies they do not find evidence for growth defense trade offs but do show that any poorly defended species that suffers high herbivory rates has low abundance. Whitfeld . also examine plant insect interactions in tropical forests this time in Papua New Guinea. While they find weak evidence of phylogenetic signal in leaf nitrogen content herbivore abundance is primarily influenced by total leaf biomass which does not exhibit significant phylogenetic signal. Their study is a reminder of the limitations of phylogenetic methods and the importance of testing the underlying assumptions of phylogenetic signal on a case by case basis. Finally extending the analyses to address ecosystem function Cadotte . show that phylogenetic diversity is a significant predictor of interannual stability in primary productivity in experimental grassland communities. Interestingly this effect seems to occur because species living with close relatives exhibit greater variability in growth suggesting that direct effects of competitive interactions may be responsible for the observed patterns. Collectively these studies provide synthetic and compelling evidence for the importance of integrating investigations of ecological and evolutionary process to understand the causes maintenance and consequences of diversity. They highlight current challenges including the need for a synthesis of phylogenetic knowledge incorporating accurate time calibrations to link to paleoclimate and geologic history. They also underscore the urgency of using phylogenetic information to understand ecosystem processes and services as well as to predict responses of organisms to global change. 648:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The organisms that live together in a community do so both because they are present in the larger regional pool and because they have characteristics that permit their existence at that locality and their coexistence with other species in the community. Neither a species regional presence nor its characters can be fully understood without taking the species history into account. That history is contingent on chance events and on deterministic interactions with other species in historical communities. As this historical approach gains favor in ecology and as our understanding of the tree of life expands ecologists and systematists are increasingly working together. However this new partnership often requires synthesizing ideas across disciplines. Our goal with this Special Issue is to explore the practical interchange of concepts between evolutionary biology and community ecology highlighting studies that both use phylogenetic information and consider the community context of individual organisms and that represent a range of disciplines from microbiology and parasitology to ornithology. Several common threads weave through the papers. The first concerns the importance and definition of the local community itself. As one steps back and takes a historical and biogeographic view of a species averaging over variation in local community composition across its range local interspecific interactions appear less influential for the species evolution. Ricklefs in considering the causes of variation in the emergent property of community species richness goes so far as to say that ecologists must abandon the idea of the local community. At the same time however there is abundant evidence that inter individual interactions do influence which particular taxa co occur alter their ranges and under certain circumstances lead to evolutionary adaptation that reduces negative interspecific interaction. Separating the effects of local processes on regional patterns and regional processes on local patterns will always be hard. However with large and numerous samples we can come to understand variation in community structure over wide areas. Lovette and Hochachka draw on the vast Breeding Bird Survey data set to examine both local and regional composition in warbler communities and Kembel and Hubbell examine phylogenetic community structure of trees at varying scales within the 50 ha BCI Forest Dynamics Plot. As well as drawing spatial boundaries around communities we are forced to define their taxonomic bounds. Cavender Bares . demonstrate how increasing the phylogenetic scale of communities influences our understanding of their phylogenetic structure. Brooks . and Weiblen . address the complex question of the phylogenetic structure of compound communities with platyhelminth parasites of anurans and insect herbivores of plants respectively. The second key thread dealt with by many authors is what exactly are ecological characters and how do they evolve? For ecologists it is obvious to ask how an organisms niche has evolved and to treat it as a character to be reconstructed on a phylogeny. However systematists often argue that because the habitats and realized niches that we can observe are influenced by interspecific interactions and community composition they are not actually evolvable entities. Instead we should decompose overall niches into directly heritable morphological and physiological characters. For example Agrawal and Fishbein show how defensive syndromes involve combinations of numerous characters of plants and Fine . show that defensive traits evolve in a trade off with growth. Different components of the overall niche may also be subject to different ecological interactions: an organism might occupy a habitat that conforms to a niche on one environmental axis while competition within a habitat might lead to resource partitioning on another axis. Silvertown . and Ackerly . attempt to detect which characters diverged earlier during the course of plant diversification. Knouft . use the new methods of GIS based niche modeling to examine the evolution of multidimensional niches in a clade of lizards by associating specimens collection locations with layers of environmental variation in space. Inferring evolutionary process from the pattern of character evolution we observe requires models of character change under known mechanisms. Unbounded continuous characters evolving under Brownian drift (slow relative to speciation rate) will tend to show conservatism (closely related species tend to be similar). Stabilizing selection will tend to increase that conservatism while conversely a reduced number of potential character states a long time between speciation events and divergent selection will tend to increase convergence. Using various methods the authors found generally more conservatism in ecological characters than convergence with some studies finding no clear relationship of traits with relatedness. Overall the results are consistent with the action of divergent selection in some systems overlaid on a null expectation of some level of phylogenetic conservatism in all systems. The third major thread in these papers is closely linked to the second: what is the phylogenetic relatedness of co occurring taxa in communities and what does this tell us about community assembly? Authors used a number of methods to combine community lists with phylogenies to answer this question. Cavender Bares . and Lovette and Hochachka correlated taxon co occurrence rates (across many samples) with phylogenetic distance  with Mantel tests). Horner Devine and Bohannan Kembel and Hubbell Weiblen . Silvertown . and Webb . tested the observed distribution of intra sample inter taxon phylogenetic distances against null models of community assembly (so raising many of the perennial questions of community null models). Several authors pointed out that methods using inter taxon phylogenetic distance rather than ancestral state reconstruction are less prone to bias introduced by the sampling of taxa that are very widely distributed on the tree of life. Several authors found that taxa in their communities were more closely related than expected indicating a common role of habitat choice and evolutionarily conserved characters. Cavender Bares . and Kembel and Hubbell found cases where taxa were less closely related than expected. Taking the results of trait evolution and community phylogenetic structure together the importance of community interactions does appear to be diminished and a long term regional view of taxa more justified. However Lovette and Hochachka found both conservatism of habitat specialization in warblers at regional scales and evidence for competitive repulsion among close relatives at local sites. Because different combinations of trait evolution pattern and ecological interaction (competition vs. habitat choice) can give similar community phylogenetic structure trait data community data and phylogenies are all needed for a full understanding of the evolution and assembly of communities. The discussion of the nature of communities and niche evolution is decades old; note that a similarly titled Special Feature appeared in this journal ten years ago. However the vast number of species that have been sequenced and for which phylogenies have been generated means that ecologists can now often infer the phylogenetic relationships of their taxa from publications and databases without further systematics work. We hope that this Special Issue will inspire readers to take advantage of these opportunities to phrase their questions in a more evolutionary way and as Westoby anticipates to participate in the new Natural History. 649:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Neuhauser . and Whitham . clearly demonstrate the powerful insights that can be gained from examining the evolutionary process in an ecological context by combining community ecology and population genetics. These approaches show how organism interactions can influence rates and direction of evolution and how genetic variation within populations can influence patterns of species abundance and diversity within communities. In doing so they provide insights into microevolutionary processes in rapidly evolving organisms and demonstrate the far reaching consequences of intraspecific genetic variation for community structure. This merging of ecology and genetics invites an even larger view that of integrating both micro and macroevolutionary processes in community ecology. The incorporation of phylogenetic analysis in community ecology has arisen parallel to the emergence of community genetics. Just as the development of quantitative and population genetic techniques for examining evolutionary change within populations has made community genetics possible so has the development of modern phylogenetic and comparative methods allowed advances in phylogenetic community ecology. These parallel advances allow for the first time a synthetic ecological perspective that incorporates an understanding of both the micro and macroevolutionary processes that influence community structure. Ecological communities are assemblages of co occurring species that potentially interact with one another. They are the result of not only present ecological processes but also past and continuing evolutionary processes. Even the agricultural communities studied by Neuhauser . reflect the evolutionary history and continuing evolution of their constituent organisms. The genetic and phenotypic outcomes of these evolutionary processes have far reaching consequences for the ecological interactions of species as illustrated in rich detail by Whitham . and Neuhauser . While community genetics allows examination of how present day genetic variation influences community dynamics incorporating a phylogenetic perspective into community ecology allows investigation of the historical processes that influence these dynamics. Phylogenetic information reveals the extent to which organisms have a shared evolutionary history and it can help us to understand the genetic and phenotypic properties of species. It can also provide information about the relative timing of historical events. This broader perspective allows us to ask where the collection of species we see coexisting today comes from why these species have the phenotypic properties they possess and why other types of species are not present. In this essay we illustrate how phylogenetic information can be combined with community genetics to address several kinds of questions. 657:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,657:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A pervasive hypothesis at the interface of ecology and evolution is that biotic interactions contribute to regional biodiversity by accelerating adaptation and speciation. We investigated this question in the context of closely related bumble bee pollinated plants (Pedicularis spp.) in the Hengduan Mountains of south central China where they exhibit spectacular levels of richness endemism and floral diversity. Because these species co occur frequently flower synchronously and share pollinators during the brief reproductive season we predict that pollinator mediated interactions may influence their community assembly and evolutionary diversification. If disparity in floral traits reduces competitive interactions between species as would happen if floral isolation mitigates reproductive interference caused by heterospecific pollen flow then species with dissimilar flowers should co occur more often yielding greater floral diversity at local scales than expected by chance. Moreover if such interactions have repeatedly driven character displacement then floral traits should exhibit homoplasy the phylogenetic signature of labile evolution. We present evidence supporting these predictions and find that local species richness is best explained by a model including both floral diversity and phylogenetic distance. Our results suggest that a dynamic mosaic of pollinator mediated interactions among Pedicularis in the Hengduan region promotes ecological sorting through recurrent selection against reproductive interference causing rapid species turnover at local scales and accelerating the rate of floral divergence among species. Together these processes may have contributed to the remarkable accumulation of florally diverse species of Pedicularis endemic to the Hengduan Mountains biodiversity hotspot. 663:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although specialization in species interactions has usually been equated to reciprocal specialization asymmetric specialization  a specialist interacting with a generalist) is also likely. Recent studies have suggested that asymmetric specialization in species interactions could be more common than previously thought. We contrasted patterns of asymmetric specialization observed in 18 plant pollinator interaction webs with predictions based on null models. We found that asymmetric specialization is common in plant pollinator interactions and that its occurrence is more frequent than expected under a simple null model that assumed random interactions among species; furthermore large assemblages with many pairs of interacting species tend to have more asymmetric interactions than smaller assemblages. A second null model which incorporated a correlation between species frequency of interaction and degree of specialization observed in most data sets produced patterns that were generally closer to those present in the data. At least three kinds of explanations could account for the observed asymmetric specialization including random interactions among individuals (rather than species) adaptive consequences of specialization and artifacts such as data aggregation and sampling biases. Future studies should be aimed at understanding the relative importance of each of these alternative explanations in generating asymmetric specialization in species interactions. 678:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Consideration of the scale at which communities are defined both taxonomically and spatially can reconcile apparently contradictory results on the extent to which plants show phylogenetic niche conservatism. In plant communities in north central Florida we collected species abundances in 55 0.1 ha plots in several state parks. When communities were defined narrowly to include a single phylogenetic lineage such as Ouercus Pinus or Ilex neighbors tended to be less related than expected (phylogenetic overdispersion) or there was no pattern. If the same communities were defined more broadly such as when all seed plants were included neighbors tended to be more related than expected (phylogenetic clustering). These results provide evidence that species interactions among close relatives influence community structure but they also show that niche conservatism is increasingly evident as communities are defined to include greater phylogenetic diversity. We also found that as the spatial scale is increased to encompass greater environmental heterogeneity; niche conservatism emerges as the dominant pattern. We then examined patterns of trait evolution in relation to trait similarity within communities for 11 functional traits for a single phylogenetic lineage (Quercus) and for all woody plants. Among the oaks convergent evolution of traits important for environmental filtering contributes to the observed pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion. At the broader taxonomic scale traits tend to be conserved giving rise to phylogenetic clustering. The shift from overdispersion to clustering can be explained by the increasing conservatism of traits at broader phylogenetic scales. 688:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecologists and evolutionary biologists perceive the ecological niche as a multidimensional relationship between an organism and its environment. Yet we know little about the degree to which multiple niche axes evolve in concert across various spatial scales to explain differences in distribution patterns and habitat specialization among lineages. Here we used contemporary phylogenetic approaches to analyze the evolution of species distributions across multiple spatial scales in Lasthenia a young and ecologically diverse plant clade largely occurring within the California Floristic Province USA. Lasthenia species and subspecies range from widely distributed taxa that occupy a diversity of habitat types to locally restricted habitat endemics including several lineages that are strongly associated with isolated ephemeral wetlands called vernal pools. We quantified the niche of Lasthenia species and subspecies at three different spatial scales: the range wide climate niche the habitat niche and the within habitat depth niche for those taxa occupying vernal pools. We incorporated phylogenetic uncertainty into our analyses by reanalyzing previously described DNA sequences in a Bayesian context and conducting all subsequent comparative analyses over the resulting posterior distribution of ultrametric phylogenetic trees. Using a biogeographic approach for ancestral habitat reconstruction we estimated that Lasthenia lineages have undergone up to four independent transitions from strictly terrestrial habitats to a niche that incorporates semiaquatic habitats and one of these transitions led to the subsequent proliferation of vernal pool species and subspecies. We found that the local niche axis corresponding to the depth distribution of taxa within pools was more phylogenetically conserved than the large scale axes representing climatic associations. Furthermore we did not find evidence that niche breadth estimates along different axes were consistently correlated indicating that ecological specialization may be specific to certain niche axes rather than an overall characteristic of a species. 716:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many studies show that species richness is correlated with climate especially among local sites within a region. However few studies have addressed how these climate diversity relationships actually arise. Only a few processes can directly change species richness  speciation extinction dispersal) and these processes may be best studied by incorporating a phylogenetic perspective. Here we used a phylogenetic approach to address the causes of climate diversity relationships in plethodontid salamanders by combining data on richness climate and phylogeny for 250 species. Our results suggest that species richness patterns in plethodontids are explained primarily by how long each region and climatic zone has been occupied rather than by the effects of either area species density  ecological limits) or climate on the rates of speciation or extinction. Across regions diversity is related to time rather than climate. Within regions significant climate diversity relationships are also related to time with higher richness in climatic regimes that have been occupied longer. Although some might think that phylogeny is unimportant at local scales and when climate and diversity are strongly correlated we show that niche conservatism and phylogenetic history (time) combine to create species pools of different sizes in different habitats (climatic regimes) leading to variation in local species richness across these habitats within a region. 720:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Net diversification rates were estimated for samples of primarily tribe to family level clades of passerine birds taking into account extinction as well as speciation. Two samples were used. The first consisted of 37 clades of primarily temperate North American and primarily tropical South American passerines; the second comprised a global set of 90 clades each distributed within one or more zoogeographic regions. Circumscription and ages of clades were taken from Sibley and Ahlquists phylogeny based on DNA hybridization with updates from more recent sequence analysis. Under a homogeneous speciation (rate equals lambda) and extinction (rate equals p) process the expected number of species (N) after t units of time can be described by the expression N(t) equals exp(lambda 1 kappa)t kappa (1 kappa) where kappa equals mu lambda. A nonlinear least squares regression for the temperate and tropical American clades with more than one species estimated kappa equals 0.938 0.076 (mean SE) suggesting a high rate of turnover of lineages within clades. Because of the broad confidence limits in kappa I used values ranging from 0.80 to 0.98 to calculate speciation rates in subsequent analyses assuming that kappa is uniform among clades and does not vary with latitude. Speciation rate among South American clades exceeded that among North American clades for all kappa whether monophyletic lineages were included or not. The estimated speciation rate was negatively related to clade age suggesting that proliferation within clades slows with time. In the global data set rate of speciation decreased with clade age and increased with the area of the region or regions within which a clade is distributed and for any given value of kappa the speciation rate was significantly higher in tropical than in temperate regions. Relaxing the assumption of latitude independence in kappa larger clade size in the tropics could be achieved by various combinations of relative speciation and extinction rates that obscure the underlying causes of global biodiversity patterns. Nonetheless the results of this analysis clearly indicate that a higher rate of diversification in the tropics contributes to the pervasive latitudinal gradient in diversity observed in passerine birds. 726:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Patterns in biodiversity and species coexistence are the result of multiple interacting processes including evolutionary history trait variation species interactions dispersal environmental variation and landscape heterogeneity. Exploring patterns of biodiversity across space is perhaps the best integrative method (in contrast to the scarcity of temporal data) to interpret the influence of these multiple and interactive effects in determining community assembly but it is still underdeveloped. Two emerging fields metacommunity ecology and community phylogenetics have been making relevant though rather independent progress toward understanding how communities are assembled in space. Our main goals were twofold. First we described a heuristical framework to merge these two fields into   metacommunity phylogenetics. The main goal of this framework is to provide a way to think about how niche properties of species arranged across the environment and different spatial scales influence the process of community assembly. Second we developed an analytical framework to link niche properties based on trait and phylogenetics to environmental and spatial variation. In order to assess the performance of the framework we used extensive computer simulations of community assembly to show that the procedure is robust under a variety of scenarios. 727:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phylogenetic community ecology combines phylogenetic hypotheses with local species composition and functional trait information to evaluate historical and contemporary mechanisms influencing local assemblage structure. Most studies assume that if functional traits are conserved then patterns of trait variation should match patterns of phylogenetic structure within local assemblages. Here we evaluated if we could predict trait structure by assuming that environmental filtering or biotic interactions work primarily on phylogenetically conserved functional traits. We investigated patterns of phylogenetic assemblage structure and functional trait variation in bill length wing length and body mass in 236 hummingbird assemblages (126 species) across two major gradients in northern South America: elevation and precipitation. While mean trait values for assemblages vary predictably based on empirical knowledge of hummingbird biology the distribution of trait values within assemblages do not correspond to those predicted based on phylogenetic signal and phylogenetic structure. Instead we were able to identify instances where assemblages have high levels of morphological variation despite their close evolutionary relatedness and vice versa. Our results provide support for both filtering and biotic interactions across gradients as has been documented in other studies. 744:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent studies of communities have examined phylogenetic signal in species functional traits to infer drivers of community assembly. Phenotypic variation in traits arising from   constitutive   genetically based variation and from environmental influences on gene expression or phenotypic plasticity could affect inferences about community assembly. We found significant trait plasticity in 12 focal species across four species interaction treatments grown in four soil environments. Phylogenetic signal in traits was present but was also dependent on species interactor treatment suggesting that phenotypic plasticity and plant neighborhood could affect the ability to detect and interpret community phylogenetic patterns of trait variation. Individuals competing with conspecifics expressed significant divergence in specific leaf area (SLA) relative to when they were grown alone. Combined with the observation that competition is stronger between close relatives than between distant relatives in some soils these results suggest that trait plasticity may be an adaptive response to competition. To test this hypothesis we examined total biomass in a pot relative to the predicted biomass of two individuals grown alone and related pot biomass to phylogenetic distance of the interactor treatment as well as to divergence in SLA and root : shoot ratio. Within competition treatments only plastic divergence in root : shoot ratio in one interactor treatment was correlated with increased productivity and only in one soil type. We also tested whether across all treatments divergence in SLA or root : shoot ratio increased pot productivity. We found that   community   productivity was positively influenced both by phylogenetic distance to competitor as well as by divergence in root : shoot ratio due to both plasticity and constitutive differences. Phenotypic plasticity resulting in trait divergence may increase the ability of plants to coexist and may also decrease phylogenetic signal in community assembly at small spatial scales. 748:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Several lines of evidence suggest that the species diversity and composition of communities should depend on genetic diversity within component species but there has been very little effort to directly assess this possibility. Here I use models of competition among genotypes and species to demonstrate a strong positive effect of the number of genotypes per species on species diversity across a range of conditions. Genetic diversity allows species to respond to selection imposed by competition resulting in both functional convergence and divergence among species depending on their initial niche positions. This ability to respond to selection promote. species coexistence and contributes to a reduction in variation in species composition among communities. These models suggest that whenever individual fitness depends on the degree of functional similarity between a focal individual and its competitors genetic diversity should promote species coexistence; this prediction is consistent with the few relevant empirical data collected to date. The results point to the importance of considering the genetic origin and diversity of material used in ecological experiments and in restoration efforts in addition to highlighting potentially important community consequences of the loss of genetic diversity in natural populations. 755:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The co occurrence of closely related species is challenging to explain because biotic filters are expected to limit the ecological similarity of species within communities. To investigate the mechanisms important in facilitating species co occurrence in diverse willow and poplar communities we examined functional diversity and community phylogenetic structure along a hydrologic gradient. We focused on traits related to drought tolerance leaf hydraulics and recruitment and examined species phylogenetic relatedness and trait lability using a molecular phylogeny. Within habitats species exhibited phenotypic clustering and across the landscape species distributions were correlated with their functional traits in a manner consistent with environmental filtering. With increasing water availability communities changed from being phylogenetically even to being phylogenetically clustered. We suggest that this shift results from environmental filtering acting on conserved traits in wet habitats and labile traits in dry habitats. Taken together these results suggest that environmental filtering is important to community assembly along the entire hydrologic gradient within this system. Although many of the traits important to habitat specialization in upland habitats are phylogenetically labile species habitat affinity is phylogenetically conserved overall indicating that niche conservatism can occur as an emergent property despite trait lability. This study demonstrates the complementary nature of trait and community phylogenetic analyses and how these methods can be used to better understand the processes involved in community assembly along environmental gradients. 756:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The demand for knowledge about the tree of life is steadily rising in ecology and other fields but bioinformatic resources designed to meet these needs remain poorly developed. Ecologists pursuing phylogenetic insights into the organization of communities have come to rely on relatively conservative reference trees that in general are poorly resolved and documented. New methods for inferring very large trees by mining data from DNA sequence repositories will undoubtedly be useful in community phylogenetics but are not without limitations. Here we argue that the collective phylogenetic knowledge embodied in the literature of systematics is a valuable resource that can be tapped in assembling synthetic trees. Assembling a composite   literature based tree by the judicious grafting of clades is one way to achieve a synthesis of current knowledge and could under some circumstances better represent   what we know about phylogenetic relationships than results obtained from automated pipelines. We describe an approach and new software for storing and annotating trees from published studies and grafting clades together in a documented and repeatable manner. Using this agglomerative approach we are in the process of assembling a literature based tree for land plants which presently contains 14 423 species from over 259 sources. For this strategy to be maximally effective improvements in digital infrastructure are needed to capture and deploy advances in phylogenetic knowledge as they are published. 758:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The distribution of traits within communities is thought to provide information on the evolutionary and ecological forces that structure community composition. Ecological character displacement (evolutionary divergence among populations of interacting species within a community) as well as community wide character displacement (even dispersion of species traits within a community via species sorting) have been widely reported and are typically interpreted as evidence for interspecific competition. However defining an appropriate null distribution with which to assess the observed distribution of traits within a community has proved controversial. Phylogenetic methods provide an alternative approach to evaluating community structure but such methods also require an appropriate null and have typically overlooked the potential for evolutionary dynamics within communities. Here we present a novel phylogenetic framework that uses evolutionary expectations to generate a simple null model of the expected distribution of traits among co occurring species. Using a stochastic Brownian motion model of trait change we illustrate that the expected community wide dispersion of traits varies with phylogenetic tree shape. We then use data on body mass for mammals to evaluate the accuracy with which phylogeny can predict the empirical distribution of traits and find a strong correlation between predicted and observed trait distributions. We suggest that deviations from phylogenetic expectations may therefore provide a useful tool for evaluating the role of competition in shaping community structure. Finally we demonstrate the utility of our approach using empirical data on body mass and a phylogeny for a small community of terrestrial mammals in Yotvata Israel and reveal evidence consistent with ecological and community wide character displacement. Our method unites ecological and evolutionary approaches and it provides a novel framework for exploring community structure. 75:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Meta analysis has contributed substantially to shifting paradigms in ecology and has become the primary method for quantitatively synthesizing published research. However an emerging challenge is the lack of a statistical protocol to synthesize studies and evaluate sources of bias while simultaneously accounting for phylogenetic nonindependence of taxa. Phylogenetic nonindependence arises from homology the similarity of taxa due to shared ancestry and treating related taxa as independent data violates assumptions of statistics. Given that an explicit goal of meta analysis is to generalize research across a broad range of taxa then phylogenetic nonindependence may threaten conclusions drawn from such reviews. Here I outline a statistical framework that integrates phylogenetic information into conventional meta analysis when (a) taking a weighted average of effect sizes using fixed and random effects models and (b) testing for homogeneity of variances. I also outline how to test evolutionary hypotheses with meta analysis by describing a method that evaluates phylogenetic conservatism and a model selection framework that competes neutral and adaptive hypotheses to explain variation in meta analytical data. Finally I address several theoretical and practical issues relating to the application and availability of phylogenetic information for meta analysis. 761:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The neutral theory for community structure and biodiversity is dependent on the assumption that species are equivalent to each other in all important ecological respects. We explore what this concept of equivalence means in ecological communities how such species may arise evolutionarily and how the possibility of ecological equivalents relates to previous ideas about niche differentiation. We also show that the co occurrence of ecologically similar or equivalent species is not incompatible with niche theory as has been supposed because niche relations can sometimes favor coexistence of similar species. We argue that both evolutionary and ecological processes operate to promote the introduction and to sustain the persistence of ecologically similar and in many cases nearly equivalent species embedded in highly structured food webs. Future work should focus on synthesizing niche and neutral perspectives rather than dichotomously debating whether neutral or niche models provide better explanations for community structure and biodiversity. 771:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The tendency for more closely related species to share similar traits and ecological strategies can be explained by their longer shared evolutionary histories and represents phylogenetic conservatism. How strongly species traits co vary with phylogeny can significantly impact how we analyze cross species data and can influence our interpretation of assembly rules in the rapidly expanding field of community phylogenetics. Phylogenetic conservatism is typically quantified by analyzing the distribution of species values on the phylogenetic tree that connects them. Many phylogenetic approaches however assume a completely sampled phylogeny: while we have good estimates of deeper phylogenetic relationships for many species rich groups such as birds and flowering plants we often lack information on more recent interspecific relationships  within a genus). A common solution has been to represent these relationships as polytomies on trees using taxonomy as a guide. Here we show that such trees can dramatically inflate estimates of phylogenetic conservatism quantified using S. P. Blomberg .s K statistic. Using simulations we show that even randomly generated traits can appear to be phylogenetically conserved on poorly resolved trees. We provide a simple rarefaction based solution that can reliably retrieve unbiased estimates of K and we illustrate our method using data on first flowering times from Thoreaus woods (Concord Massachusetts USA). 786:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Urban areas are among the most heavily managed landscapes in the world yet they harbor a remarkable richness of species. Private yards are common habitats in urban areas and are places where cultivated species manage to escape cultivation and become part of the spontaneous species pool. Yards are novel ecosystems where community assembly is driven by both natural and anthropogenic processes. Phylogenetic diversity and functional traits are increasingly recognized as critical to understanding processes of community assembly. Recent evidence indicates that urban areas may select more closely related plant species from the pool of regionally occurring species than do nonurban areas and that exotic species are phylogenetically clustered within communities. We tested whether phylogenetic diversity and functional trait composition in privately managed yards change along a gradient of housing density in the Minneapolis Saint Paul metropolis Minnesota USA in accordance with these predictions. We also identified characteristics of the spontaneous yard flora by comparing its phylogenetic diversity and functional composition with the   natural areas species pool represented by the flora of nearby Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. Along the urbanization gradient yards had more species per hectare in densely built regions than in lower density regions but phylogenetic diversity and functional composition did not change with housing density. In contrast in comparison to species in natural areas yard species were more closely related to each other and functionally distinct: They were more often short lived self compatible and had higher specific leaf area than species of Cedar Creek. The high number of exotic yard species increased the yard floras phylogenetic relatedness in comparison to species of Cedar Creek causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in urban environments and beyond such as accelerating decomposition rates. Limited phylogenetic diversity may reduce the potential of ecosystems to respond to environmental changes. As cities continue to expand globally understanding the impacts of yard management for biodiversity and ecosystem services becomes increasingly important. 78:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One approach to understanding how mutualisms function in community settings is to model well studied pairwise interactions in the presence of the few species with which they interact most strongly. In nature such species are often specialized antagonists of one or both mutualists. Hence these models can also shed light on the problem of when and how mutualisms are able to persist in the face of exploitation. We used spatial stochastic simulations to model the ecological dynamics of obligate species specific mutualisms between plants and pollinating seed parasite insects  yuccas and yucca moths) in the presence of one of two obligate antagonist species: flower feeding insects (florivores) or insects that parasitize seeds but fail to pollinate (exploiters). Our results suggest that mutualisms can persist surprisingly well in the presence of highly specialized antagonists but that they exhibit distinctly different temporal and spatial dynamics when antagonists are present. In our models antagonists tend to induce oscillations in the mutualist populations. As the number of per capita visits by antagonists increase the systems oscillatory dynamics become more extreme finally leading to the extinction of one or more of the three species. When the antagonists exhibit high per capita visitation frequencies and long dispersal distances significant spatial patchiness emerges within these tripartite interactions. We found surprisingly little difference between the ecological effects of florivores and exploiters although in general florivores tended to drive themselves (and sometimes the mutualists) to extinction at parameter values at which the exploiters were able to persist. These theoretical results suggest several testable hypotheses regarding the ecological and evolutionary persistence of mutualisms. More broadly they point to the critical importance of studying the dynamics of pairwise interactions in community contexts. 794:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We know a great deal about the plastic responses of plant phenotypes to the abiotic and biotic environment but very little about the consequences of phenotypic plasticity for plant communities. In other words we know that plant traits can vary widely for a given genotype but we know little about the importance of trait mediated interactions (TMI) among plants. Here we discuss three major factors that affect the expression of phenotypic plasticity: variation in the abiotic environment variation in the presence or identity of neighbors and variation in herbivory. We consider how plastic responses to these factors might affect interactions among plants. Plastic responses to the abiotic environment have important consequences for conditionality in competitive effects to the point of causing shifts from competitive to facilitative interactions. Because plants show a high degree of plasticity in response to neighbors and even to the specific identify of neighbors phenotypic plasticity may allow species to adjust to the composition of their communities promoting coexistence and community diversity. Likewise plastic responses to consumers may have various and counterintuitive consequences: induction of plant resistance compensatory growth and increased resource uptake may affect interactions among plants in ways that cannot be predicted simply by considering biomass lost to consumers. What little we know about TMI among plants suggests that they should not be ignored in plant community theory. Although work to date on the community consequences of phenotypic plasticity has been hampered by experimental constraints new approaches such as manipulating phenotypes by using signals instead of actual environmental conditions and the use of transgenic plants should allow us to rapidly expand our understanding of the community consequences of plant plasticity. 796:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We use a phylogeny of the North American Enallagma damselflies derived from molecular and morphological data to examine how the patterns of local and regional assemblage structure developed in this taxon across eastern North America. The two primary clades in the genus have nearly identical numbers of extant species but the centers of diversity and the diversification rates for the two clades are quite different. One clade has its center of diversity in New England and radiated very recently from three species to give the current Is. Although most of this radiation involved the creation of new species in the ancestral fish lake habitat at least two independent lineages invaded and adapted to a new habitat: ponds and lakes lacking fish but supporting large numbers of large predatory dragonflies. The other clade with greatest diversity in the southeastern United States contains species that inhabit only water bodies that support fish populations. This   southeastern   clade diversified at a much slower and more steady pace within the fish lake habitat than the   New England   clade but four speciation events in this clade appear to have occurred at the same time as the northern radiation. Combined with our current understanding of local community structure in fish and fishless lakes these results indicate that most of the species in this regional assemblage were created by speciation mechanisms other than filling empty niches which have resulted in many locally coexisting species that are very similar in their ecological characteristics. Damselflies in eastern North American ponds and lakes appear to exemplify features of both a regulated component of the littoral food web  a Functional group) and an assemblage whose local community composition is influenced by nonadaptive macroevolutionary processes that have operated on a much larger regional scale. 824:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Co occurring species might be morphologically similar because they are adapted to the same environment or morphologically dissimilar to minimize competition. We use sister species comparisons to evaluate the relationship between morphological disparity and regional patterns of co occurrence across carnivores. Up to 63 PeRcEnT of the variation in range overlap can be explained by morphological divergence in dentition. Species that differ more in carnassial tooth length overlap more in their geographical range. Carnassials are the primary teeth associated with food processing and hence difference in carnassial size may be a good indicator of difference in resource use. We suggest this pattern is consistent with competition in sympatry driving ecological character displacement or competitive exclusion among ecologically similar species. Our study uses newly available data on global distributions morphology and phylogeny and is the first to demonstrate a close relationship between morphological disparity and co occurrence at a regional scale encompassing multiple communities. 829:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its similarity to concepts of the niche the many levels of biological phenomena to which it applies and the complexity of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and environmental performance. This covariation itself depends upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and life history and complexity in the environment stemming from factors such as species interactions and spatio temporal heterogeneity in resources. Here we develop a view on specialisation that integrates across the range of biological phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events. 82:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phenotypic plasticity is a key factor for the success of organisms in heterogeneous environments. Although many forms of phenotypic plasticity can be induced and retracted repeatedly few extant models have analyzed conditions for the evolution of reversible plasticity. We present a general model of reversible plasticity to examine how plastic shifts in the mode and breadth of environmental tolerance functions (that determine relative fitness) depend on time lags in response to environmental change the pattern of individual exposure to inducing and noninducing environments and the quality of available information about the environment. We couched the model in terms of prey induced responses to variable predation regimes. With longer response lags relative to the rate of environmental change the modes of tolerance functions in both the presence or absence of predators converge on a generalist strategy that lies intermediate between the optimal functions for the two environments in the absence of response lags. Incomplete information about the level of predation risk in inducing environments causes prey to have broader tolerance functions even at the cost of reduced maximal fitness. We give a detailed analysis of how these factors and interactions among them select for joint patterns of mode and breadth plasticity. 839:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Given the potential for rapid and microgeographical adaptation ecologists increasingly are exploring evolutionary explanations for community patterns. Biotic selection can generate local adaptations that alter species interactions. Although some gene flow might be necessary to fuel local adaptation higher gene flow can homogenise traits across regions and generate local maladaptation. Herein I estimate the contributions of local biotic selection gene flow and spatially autocorrelated biotic selection to among population divergence in traits involved in species interactions across 75 studies. Local biotic selection explained 6.9 PeRcEnT of inter population trait divergence an indirect estimate of restricted gene flow explained 0.1 PeRcEnT and spatially autocorrelated selection explained 9.3 PeRcEnT. Together biotic selection explained 16 PeRcEnT of the variance in population trait means. Most biotic selection regimes were spatially autocorrelated. Hence most populations receive gene flow from populations facing similar selection which could allow for local adaptation despite moderate gene flow. Gene flow constrained adaptation in studies conducted at finer spatial scales as expected but this effect was often confounded with spatially autocorrelated selection. Results indicate that traits involved in species interactions might often evolve across landscapes especially when biotic selection is spatially autocorrelated. The frequent evolution of species interactions suggests that evolutionary processes might often influence community ecology. 853:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Neutral biodiversity theory has the potential to contribute to our understanding of how macroevolutionary dynamics influence contemporary biodiversity but there are issues regarding its dynamical predictions that must first be resolved. Here we address these issues by extending the theory in two ways using a novel analytical approach: (1) we set the absolute tempo of biodiversity dynamics by explicitly incorporating population level stochasticity in abundance; (2) we allow new species to arise with more than one individual. Setting the absolute tempo yields quantitative predictions on biodiversity dynamics that can be tested using contemporary and fossil data. Allowing incipient species abundances greater than one individual yields predictions on how these dynamics and the form of the species abundance distribution are affected by multiple speciation modes. We apply this new model to contemporary and fossil data that encompass 30 Myr of macroevolution for planktonic foraminifera. By synthesizing the model with these empirical data we present evidence that dynamical issues with neutral biodiversity theory may be resolved by incorporating the effects of environmental stochasticity and incipient species abundance on biodiversity dynamics. 87:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial structuring is important in understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of natural populations since local demes are rarely if ever completely isolated from neighboring demes. Plant host pathogen interactions provide good examples of coevolutionary systems where both numerical and genetic dynamics have been explicitly investigated in a spatial context and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. In this article we focus on long term studies of several natural host pathogen interactions that span a range of life histories and taxa. We use these studies to evaluate some predictions for numerical and genetic patterns at local and regional scales. Specifically we examine the degree of among population asynchrony in disease presence absence and abundance and the extent to which this is a function of isolation. For one host pathogen interaction (Linum Melampsora) we focus on whether there is local correspondence between resistance and virulence genes las would be predicted by single population coevolutionary models) or whether such correspondence occurs at larger spatial scales. Finally we discuss the implications of these studies with respect to the impact of host and pathogen life history variation on the spatial scale of coevolutionary interactions. Understanding coevolutionary interactions in nature requires a multidisciplinary approach including long term empirical studies of multiple populations and computer modeling. 88:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species diversity and genetic diversity may be correlated as a result of processes acting in parallel at the two levels. However no theories predict the conditions under which different relationships between species diversity and genetic diversity might arise and therefore when one level of diversity may be predicted using the other. I used simulation models to investigate the parallel influence of locality area immigration rate and environmental heterogeneity on species diversity and genetic diversity. The most common pattern was moderate to strong positive species genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs). Such correlations may be driven by any one of the three locality characteristics examined but important exceptions and patterns emerged. Genetic diversity and species diversity were more weakly correlated when genetic diversity was measured for rare versus common species. Environmental heterogeneity not only imposes spatially varying selection on populations and communities but also causes changes in species population sizes and therefore genetic diversity; these interacting processes can create positive negative or unimodal relationships of genetic diversity with species diversity. When species are considered as part of multispecies communities predictions from single species models of genetic diversity apply in some instances (effects of area and immigration) but often not in others (effects of environmental heterogeneity). 891:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The development of quantitative models of species distributions has largely ignored the potential for intraspecific variation in species niche requirements. Application of such models may nevertheless provide a rich untapped opportunity to address the basic issue of niche conservatism vs. evolution. We illustrate this potential using genetic algorithms coupled with geographical information systems which provide a powerful and novel approach to characterizing species ecological niches and geographical distributions. Our example consists of several species of Mexican birds with recognized subspecies and associated climatic and vegetation data. Our basic protocol is to develop an ecological niche model for each subspecies and use this model to predict distributions of other subspecies. In some cases the ecological niche model inferred for one subspecies provides an excellent descriptor of other subspecies ranges whereas in other cases the prediction is rather poor. We suggest that the latter may reveal the potential existence of evolved intraspecific niche differentiation. We discuss alternative non evolutionary explanations and point out potential implications of our results for predictive models of species invasions. 892:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The diversity of life is ultimately generated by evolution and much attention has focused on the rapid evolution of ecological traits. Yet the tendency for many ecological traits to instead remain similar over time niche conservatism (NC) has many consequences for the fundamental patterns and processes studied in ecology and conservation biology. Here we describe the mounting evidence for the importance of NC to major topics in ecology  species richness ecosystem function) and conservation  climate change invasive species). We also review other areas where it may be important but has generally been overlooked in both ecology  food webs disease ecology mutualistic interactions) and conservation  habitat modification). We summarize methods for testing for NC and suggest that a commonly used and advocated method (involving a test for phylogenetic signal) is potentially problematic and describe alternative approaches. We suggest that considering NC: (1) focuses attention on the within species processes that cause traits to be conserved over time (2) emphasizes connections between questions and research areas that are not obviously related  invasives global warming tropical richness) and (3) suggests new areas for research  why are some clades largely nocturnal? why do related species share diseases?). 895:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The increasing availability of phylogenetic data computing power and informatics tools has facilitated a rapid expansion of studies that apply phylogenetic data and methods to community ecology. Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long standing controversies in community ecology challenges previous assumptions and opens new areas of investigation. In particular studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation adaptation and extinction. Finally phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent and over what temporal scale is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences. Harnessing phylogenetic information to understand and forecast changes in diversity and dynamics of communities is a critical step in managing and restoring the Earths biota in a time of rapid global change. 90:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species interactions commonly coevolve as complex geographic mosaics of populations shaped by differences in local selection and gene flow. We use a haploid matching alleles model for coevolution to evaluate how a pair of species coevolves when fitness interactions are reciprocal in some locations (  hot spots  ) but not in others (  cold spots  ). Our analyses consider mutualistic and antagonistic interspecific interactions and a variety of gene Dow patterns between hot and cold spots. We found that hot and cold spots together with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in four important ways. First hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution although rare hat spots wilt not have a disproportionate impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second asymmetries in gene flow can influence local adaptation sometimes creating stable equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal fitness in cold spots or vice versa. Third asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms through coevolution. Fourth intraspecific allele frequency differences among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some but not all conditions. That is selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across the landscapes over which species interact. Altogether our analyses indicate that coevolutionary trajectories can be strongly shaped by the geographic distribution of coevolutionary hot and cold spots and by the pattern of gene flow among populations. 922:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We used the largest DNA based phylogeny of flowering plants to date to evaluate the importance of energy vs. past climate change in predicting global patterns in diversification. Relative diversification rates increased towards the equator suggesting that differences in per lineage net diversification may be an important component of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The amplitude of Quaternary climate oscillations experienced by families explained variation in diversification equally well compared to contemporary energy measures and energy and climate change measures were intercorrelated making it difficult to reject either as a causal mechanism. Many putative mechanisms linking diversification to energy availability do not apply to plants whereas the climate change mechanism has more support. We also present the first global map of angiosperm diversification showing that after correcting for family range size tropical diversification rates were fastest for clades currently in regions with high endemic species richness outside the main lowland rainforest areas. 93:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,93:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixers are critical components of many terrestrial ecosystems. There is evidence that some N fixers fix N at the same rate regardless of environmental conditions (a strategy we call obligate) while others adjust N fixation to meet their needs (a strategy we call facultative). Although these strategies are likely to have qualitatively different impacts on their environment the relative effectiveness and ecosystem level impacts of each strategy have not been explored. Using a simple mathematical model we determine the best facultative strategy and show that it excludes any obligate strategy (fixer or nonfixer) in our basic model. To provide an explanation for the existence of nonfixers and obligate fixers we show that both costs of being facultative and time lags inherent in the process of N fixation can select against facultative N fixers and also produce the seemingly paradoxical patterns of sustained N limitation and N richness. Finally we speculate on why the costs and lags may differ between temperate and tropical regions and thus whether they can explain patterns in both biomes simultaneously. 95:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The nondirectional coevolutionary dynamics often produced by the geographic mosaic of species interactions may be precisely the important processes that allow interactions to persist in the midst of a constantly changing world. This view contrasts with that of Vermeij who has argued that antagonistic coevolution has been largely replaced by a more diffuse macroevolutionary process that he has called escalation. It is likely that coevolution and escalation are both crucial as ongoing evolutionary processes. Although the geographic mosaic of coevolution may often not scale up to major macroevolutionary patterns it is the true interface of evolution and ecology. These ongoing coevolutionary processes and patterns are what we need to understand how to develop more effective approaches to the conservation of species diversity the manipulation of the geographic dynamics of diseases and increased long term effectiveness of biological control programs. 986:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, George Gaylord Simpson famously postulated that much of lifes diversity originated as adaptive radiations more or less simultaneous divergences of numerous lines from a single ancestral adaptive type. However identifying adaptive radiations has proven difficult due to a lack of broad scale comparative datasets. Here we use phylogenetic comparative data on body size and shape in a diversity of animal clades to test a key model of adaptive radiation in which initially rapid morphological evolution is followed by relative stasis. We compared the fit of this model to both single selective peak and random walk models. We found little support for the early burst model of adaptive radiation whereas both other models particularly that of selective peaks were commonly supported. In addition we found that the net rate of morphological evolution varied inversely with clade age. The youngest clades appear to evolve most rapidly because long term change typically does not attain the amount of divergence predicted from rates measured over short time scales. Across our entire analysis the dominant pattern was one of constraints shaping evolution continually through time rather than rapid evolution followed by stasis. We suggest that the classical model of adaptive radiation where morphological evolution is initially rapid and slows through time may be rare in comparative data. 987:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Identifying nonrandom clade diversification is a critical first step toward understanding the evolutionary processes underlying any radiation and how best to preserve future phylogenetic diversity. However differences in diversification rates have not been quantitatively assessed for the majority of groups because of the lack of necessary analytical tools  complete species level phylogenies estimates of divergence times and robust statistics which incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty and test appropriate null models of clade growth). Here for the first time we investigate diversification rate heterogeneity in one of the largest groups studied thus far the bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera). We use a recent robust statistical approach (whole tree likelihood based relative rate tests) on complete dated species level supertree phylogenies. As has been demonstrated previously for most other groups among lineage diversification rate within bats has not been constant. However we show that bat diversification is more heterogeneous than in other mammalian clades thus far studied. The whole tree likelihood based relative rates tests suggest that clades within the families Phyllostomidae and Molossidae underwent a number of significant changes in relative diversification rate. There is also some evidence for rate shifts within Pteropodidae Emballonuridae Rhinolophidae Hipposideridae and Vespertilionidae but the significance of these shifts depends on polytomy resolution within each family. Diversification rate in bats has also not been constant with the largest diversification rate shifts occurring 3050 million years ago a time overlapping with the greatest number of shifts in flowering plant diversification rates. 988:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Much of the dynamics of coevolution may be driven by the interplay between geographic variation in reciprocal selection (selection mosaics) and the homogenizing action of gene flow. We develop a genetic model of geographically structured coevolution in which gene flow links coevolving communities that may differ in both the direction and magnitude of reciprocal selection. The results show that geographically structured coevolution may lead to allele frequency dines within both interacting species when fitnesses are spatially uniform or spatially heterogeneous. Furthermore the results show that the behavior and shape of dines differ dramatically among different types of coevolutionary interaction. Antagonistic interactions produce dynamic dines that change shape rapidly through time producing shifting patterns of local adaptation and maladaptation. Unlike antagonistic interactions mutualisms generate stable equilibrium patterns that lead to fixed spatial patterns of adaptation. Interactions that vary between mutualism and antagonism produce both equilibrium and dynamic dines. Furthermore the results demonstrate that these interactions may allow mutualisms to persist throughout the geographic range of an interaction despite pockets of locally antagonistic selection. In all cases the coevolved spatial patterns of allele frequencies are sensitive to the relative contributions of gene flow selection and overall habitat size indicating that the appropriate scale for studies of geographically structured coevolution depends on the relative contributions of each of these factors. 989:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Numerous evolutionary studies have sought to explain the distribution of diversity across the limbs of the tree of life. At the same time ecological studies have sought to explain differences in diversity and relative abundance within and among ecological communities. Traditionally these patterns have been considered separately but models that consider processes operating at the level of individuals such as neutral biodiversity theory (NBT) can provide a link between them. Here we compare evolutionary dynamics across a suite of NBT models. We show that NBT can yield phylogenetic tree topologies with imbalance closely resembling empirical observations. In general metacommunities that exhibit greater disparity in abundance are characterized by more imbalanced phylogenetic trees. However NBT fails to capture the tempo of diversification as represented by the distribution of branching events through time. We suggest that population level processes might therefore help explain the asymmetry of phylogenetic trees but that tree shape might mislead estimates of evolutionary rates unless the diversification process is modeled explicitly. 995:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We studied the selection response of the freshwater grazing zooplankter Daphnia galeata to increased abundance of cyanobacteria in its environment. Cyanobacteria are a poor quality and often toxic food. Distinct genotypes of D. galeata were hatched from diapausing eggs extracted from three time horizons in the sediments of Lake Constance Europe covering the period 1962 to 1997 a time of change in both the prevalence of planktonic cyanobacteria and levels of phosphorus pollution. We assessed whether the grazers evolved to become more resistant to dietary cyanobacteria by exposing genetically distinct clones to two diets one composed only of the nutritious green alga Scenedesmus obliquus (good food) and the other a mixture of S. obliquus and the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (poor food) Genotype performance was measured as the specific rate of weight gain from neonate to maturity (g(j)). We evaluated evolutionary change in the Daphnia population using an analysis of reaction norms based on relative (log transformed) changes in g(j). Log(g(j)) is a measure of the proportional effect of dietary cyanobacteria on other fitness components of the Daphnia phenotype. For comparison we also analyze absolute  nontransformed) changes in g(i) and discuss the interpretations of the two approaches. Statistical results using a general linear model demonstrate a significant effect of genotype (showing differences in g(j) among genotypes) a significant genotype X food type interaction (showing differences in phenotypic plasticity among genotypes) and in the case of log transformed data a significant sediment genotype age X food type interaction. The latter shows that phenotypic plasticity evolved over the period studied. Two constraints act on response to selection in the D. galeata Lake Constance system. First g(j) on a diet containing poor food is highly correlated with g(j) on a diet of good food thus evolving resistance also meant evolving an increase in g(j) on both diets. Second because genotypes with a high g(j) also grow to a large adult body size which in turn increases Daphnia vulnerability to fish predation we suggest that selection only acted to favor genotypes possessing a high potential gj after cyanobacteria became prevalent. The presence of cyanobacteria depressed realized g(j) and led to animals of small adult body size even if their genotypes had the potential for high g(j) and large size. With realized g(j) reduced genotypes with an inherently high value could be selected even in the presence of predatory fish. The joint action of selection by dietary cyanobacteria and vulnerability to fish predation provides an explanation for the observed evolution of resistance to poor food through reduced phenotypic plasticity. 1006:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An allometric framework is used to construct a model for seed plant annual reproductive biomass based on standing leaf stem and root biomass. According to this model the scaling of reproduction is governed by numerous taxon specific scaling exponents and constants that reflect the allometry of vegetative biomass partitioning. Although this allometry cannot be predicted a priori the model accurately predicts all observed inter and intraspecific reproductive biomass trends based on the exponents and constants determined for a worldwide database representative of herbaceous and tree sized dicot monocot and conifer species growing in diverse habitats. The model also identifies the body proportions for which reproduction is energetically untenable. The limits for seed plant reproductive biomass are thus established providing a conceptual and quantitative basis for understanding the scaling of reproductive capacity across and within ecologically and evolutionarily diverse spermatophytes. 1029:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Anthropogenic understory fires have affected large areas of tropical forest in recent decades particularly during severe droughts. Yet the mechanisms that control fire induced mortality of tropical trees and lianas remain ambiguous due to the challenges associated with documenting mortality given variation in fire behavior and forest heterogeneity. In a seasonally dry Amazon forest we conducted a burn experiment to quantify how increasing understory fires alter patterns of stem mortality. From 2004 to 2007 tree and liana mortality was measured in adjacent 50 ha plots that were intact (B0 control) burned once (B1) and burned annually for 3 years (B3). After 3 years cumulative tree and liana mortality (  1 cm dbh) in the B1 (5.8 PeRcEnT yr( 1)) and B3 (7.0 PeRcEnT yr( 1)) plots significantly exceeded mortality in the control (3.2 PeRcEnT yr( 1)). However these fire induced mortality rates are substantially lower than those reported from more humid Amazonian forests. Small stems were highly vulnerable to fire induced death contrasting with drought induced mortality (measured in other studies) that increases with tree size. For example one low intensity burn killed  50 PeRcEnT of stems  10 cm within a year. Independent of stem size species specific mortality rates varied substantially from 0 PeRcEnT to 17 PeRcEnT yr( 1) in the control 0 PeRcEnT to 26 PeRcEnT yr( 1) in B1 and 1 PeRcEnT to 23 PeRcEnT yr( 1) in B3 with several species displaying high variation in their vulnerability to fire induced mortality. Protium guianense (Burseraceae) exhibited the highest fire induced mortality rates in B1 and B3 which were 10 and 9 fold greater than the baseline rate. In contrast Aspidosperma excelsum (Apocynaceae) appeared relatively unaffected by fire (0.3 PeRcEnT to 1.0 PeRcEnT mortality yr( 1) across plots) which may be explained by fenestration that protects the inner concave trunk portions from fire. For stems   10 cm both char height (approximating fire intensity) and number of successive burns were significant predictors of fire induced mortality whereas only the number of consecutive annual burns was a strong predictor for stems  10cm. Three years after the initial burn 62 26 Mg ha( 1) (s.e.) of live biomass predominantly stems  30cm was transferred to the dead biomass pool compared with 8 3 Mg ha( 1) in the control. This biomass loss from fire represents similar to 30 PeRcEnT of this forests aboveground live biomass (192 ( 3) Mg ha( 1):  1 cm DBH). Although forest transition to savanna has been predicted based on future climate scenarios our results indicate that wildfires from agricultural expansion pose a more immediate threat to the current carbon stocks in Amazonian forests. 1030:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Long term ecological research projects have become cornerstones for the study of forest dynamics worldwide. The intense large scale research efforts necessary to monitor ecological processes may alter natural processes and be a source of error in analyses. This study evaluated whether trampling due to concentrated researcher presence has altered the structure and composition of the seedling layer in the 50 ha permanent sample plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) Panama. Since 1980 major research projects in the plot have included complete tree censuses every 5 years weekly seed trap collection and the more recent annual censuses of 20 000 1 m(2) seedling quadrats. We compared data from these pre existing seedling quadrats with data from 600 newly established seedling quadrats in an area of much lower research intensity adjacent to the 50 ha plot and tested for differences in seedling density height class distributions species richness and composition. Although we expected to find evidence of researcher impacts on the seedling layer we found no significant differences in seedling community structure or composition inside and outside of the BCI 50 ha plot. We conclude that there is no evidence that research efforts within the BCI plot have thus far resulted in significant changes in the seedling layer. The extent of research impacts is likely to differ under varying environmental conditions and research protocols. Continued efforts should be made to quantify the impacts of research methodology at long term research sites in order to detect site specific or long term changes. 1032:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tasmaphena lamproides is a rare snail found in northwest Tasmania. The species is eliminated by logging but re establishes a population in similar to20 year old native forest regeneration and builds up to pre logging levels by similar to60 years. Major plantation development is planned within the range of the species. It is unlikely that T lamproides will reinvade areas converted to plantation. To aid the conservation of T lamproides the managing authority planned to retain a   biodiversity spine    a string of contiguous coupes (logging units) that would be regenerated to native forest rather than converted to plantation) within areas earmarked for major plantation development. A PVA was used to assess the comparative impacts of different forest management scenarios. The management scenarios modelled involved differing levels of reservation differing levels of native forest regeneration or conversion to plantation different rotation lengths for native forest regeneration and different temporal patterns of logging of native forest. In a forest block with a major reserve simulations indicated that the population would decline to around 50 PeRcEnT of the original population and thereafter remain fairly stable. For a forest block earmarked for plantation development where no major reserves occurred simulations indicated the population would undergo a steep decline to around 20 PeRcEnT of the original population. The extent of the recovery of the population before re harvesting of the native forest coupes depended on the extent of the biodiversity spine. The probability of reaching low absolute population levels ( one or two thousand individuals) varied with the degree of plantation development but not linearly. Increasing the length of the rotation of native forest coupes lowered the probability of reaching low absolute numbers as did increasing the spread of logging of coupes over the length of the rotation rather than logging all of the coupes over a short time span. The model allows the managing authority to design a management scenario that meets a specific quantitative goal such as a less than 10 PeRcEnT probability of numbers falling below 1000 individuals. It also allows them to choose between a mix of different forest management strategies that could all potentially provide the same level of conservation benefit. 1033:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The loss of tree mass over time from damage can lead to underestimates in above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) if not accounted for properly. Bias in the allometric relationship between trunk base diameter (D b at 1.3 m height or above the buttresses) and mass can also lead to systematic errors in ANPP estimates. We developed an unbiased model of the relationship between D b and tree mass using data from 315 trees (greater than or equal to5 cm D b) harvested in the central Amazon. This model was compared with other theoretical (n equals 1) and empirical models (n equals 4). The theoretical model and one empirical model made predictions that differed substantially form our central Amazon model. The other three empirical models made predictions that were consistent with our model despite being developed in different tropical forests. Models differed mostly in predicting large tree mass. Using permanent forest inventory plot data our D b versus tree mass model and a bole volume model we estimated that tree damage amounts to 0.9 Mg ha( 1) per year (dry mass) of litter production. This damage should be included as a mass loss term when calculating ANPP. Incorporating fine litter data from published studies we estimated that average ANPP for central Amazon plateau forests is at least 12.9 Mg ha( 1) per year (or 6.5 Mg C ha( 1) per year). Additional sources of error as described in the text can raise this estimate by as much as 4 Mg ha( 1) per year. We hypothesize that tree damage in old growth forests accounts for a significant portion of age related decline in productivity. 1044:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Citation rates increase with increasing number of authors and ecologythemed manuscripts with four or more authors are more likely to be accepted for publication. This may reflect a direct collaboration benefit or a greater network of scientists who know or recognize the authors. Using a dataset of 313 papers published in Oecologia from 1998 to 2000 we tested whether the scientific status of an author or co author affects the citation rate of the paper and if papers written or co authored by well established and recognized scientists the bigwigs attract more citations than papers by lower profile authors. Such effects may be because bigwigs improve the quality of manuscripts that they are involved with or because they attract citations due to their prestige; either way this may be an important question for junior scientists when they are deciding whether to collaborate with a heavyweight colleague. We defined a bigwig as a person with an h index (Hirsch 2005) within the top 10 PeRcEnT of the cumulative h value of authors in our dataset (total of 850 authors) thus ecologists with an h   35 were considered as bigwigs. Papers written or co authored by bigwigs had on average higher citation rates than those without one (4.50 __ 0.27 and 2.97 __ 0.37 respectively; F 14.35 P 0.0002). However this difference was significant only for papers with up to three authors and disappeared when papers had   4 authors (author status author number: F 4.97 P 0.026; Figure 1a). This may reflect a greater relative contribution of the bigwig to a paper with fewer authors or could arise because visually recognizing bigwig names is easier when the list contains fewer authors. Citation rates of papers with four or more authors were not significantly different whether a bigwig was involved or not and citation rates tended to increase with author number for non bigwig papers (suggesting that collaboration with lower profile authors still has benefits). In other words the summed contribution of several low profile authors seems to counterbalance the benefit of a bigwig contribution in multi authored papers. Interestingly for bigwigs there were no significant benefits from collaboration with lower profile authors and the citation rates of papers with a bigwig as a co author tended to decrease as the number of lower profile authors increased. Collaborating and coauthoring can however still be beneficial for bigwigs in terms of more publications generated and less effort required. If the cumulative or average status (h) of authors increases as the number of authors on multi authored non bigwig papers increases so that the average or cumulative status for multi authored papers is the same irrespective of whether a bigwig is involved or not then this could explain why the citation rates of multi authored papers (with and without a bigwig co author) do not differ. However this was not the case; the average h was always lower and did not change with author number for papers without a bigwig involved (author status: F 308.90 P 0.0001; author number: F 0.19 P 0.6617; author status author number: F 48.69 P 0.0001; Figure 1b). Single authored bigwig papers had higher average h as compared with that in multi authored bigwig papers but there was also no increase in average h with author number for the multi authored bigwig papers (Figure 1b). Furthermore as expected the cumulative h was higher for bigwig papers and increased with author number for all papers (author status: F equals 228.31 P 0.0001; author number: F 171.02 P 0.001; author status author number: F 1.07 P 0.3008; Figure 1c). It seems that author status affects citation rates depending on author number. Bigwig effects are most pronounced for citation rates of papers with less than four authors. Therefore lower profile authors should either try to have few collaborators including a bigwig or many lower profile collaborators. To guarantee their impact bigwigs in turn should publish alone or only with one or two authors. 1045:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Double blind review as a means to reduce publication bias is a perennially controversial topic: is it beneficial and do authors want it? Above Hammerschmidt . propose a low initial percentage of female first authors as an alternative explanation for the observed increase following a change to double blind review. However the three non behavioral journals examined in our study had even lower percentages of female first authors. Inter journal variation probably reflects disciplinary differences in the demographics of publishing authors thereby highlighting the need if benchmarks are to be used for accurate workforce data. The cited value of 37 PeRcEnT reflects the US life sciences workforce as reported by the National Science Foundation and unfortunately does not allow us to accurately infer publication changes in a specialized international journal. Nonetheless we agree with Hammerschmidt . that implementation of double blind review may only partially contribute to the development of a fair review process; it is not intended as a panacea. There are multiple factors affecting submission and publication of manuscripts. However publication data provide a blunt tool to infer what authors want; a better approach is to ask them. In 2006 we conducted a survey of author perspectives on the publication process using EvolDir ECOLOG and advertising at conferences and received 1334 responses (see Grod . in review for methods). Forty nine percent indicated they would prefer to submit to a double blind journal 25 PeRcEnT had no opinion and 25 PeRcEnT indicated that they would not prefer double blind review (n equals 1249). The sexes differed; females preferred double blind review ( 2 1 equals 11.5 P   0.001). Those favoring double blind review were less experienced authors regardless of gender (Mann Whitney U test on years since first publication; Z equals 4.93 P   0.001). Apparently junior researchers and women perceive double blind review as more objective. It is often argued that double blind review makes it harder to secure reviewers; however 96 PeRcEnT of respondents reported that they would not be deterred from reviewing a double blind manuscript. Further study of the influence of double blind review on publication outcomes is needed. However the fact that half of our survey respondents preferred this approach suggests there is nothing to fear. 1049:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As landscapes throughout Europe and eastern North America recover from past agricultural use forests continue to reflect their agricultural history. For centuries after agriculture has ceased plant communities on abandoned agricultural lands remain impoverished in herbaceous species characteristic of uncleared forests. To facilitate the recovery of biological diversity in these forests and to anticipate the effects of future land use decisions we need to understand the process of recolonization. The unique interactions between forest herbs and agricultural history also allow us to explore some universal questions in ecology such as how dispersal and environment limit species distributions. 1121:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large scale wildfires are expected to accelerate forest dieback in Amazonia but the fire vulnerability of tree species remains uncertain in part due to the lack of studies relating fire induced mortality to both fire behavior and plant traits. To address this gap we established two sets of experiments in southern Amazonia. First we tested which bark traits best predict heat transfer rates (R) through bark during experimental bole heating. Second using data from a large scale fire experiment we tested the effects of tree wood density (WD) size and estimated R (inverse of cambium insulation) on tree mortality after one to five fires. In the first experiment bark thickness explained 82 PeRcEnT of the variance in R while the presence of water in the bark reduced the difference in temperature between the heat source and the vascular cambium perhaps because of high latent heat of vaporization. This novel finding provides an important insight for improving mechanistic models of fire induced cambium damage from tropical to temperate regions. In the second experiment tree mortality increased with increasing fire intensity  as indicated by bark char height on tree boles) which was higher along the forest edge during the 2007 drought and when the fire return interval was 3 years instead of one. Contrary to other tropical studies the relationship between mortality and fire intensity was strongest in the year following the fires but continued for 3 years afterwards. Tree mortality was low ( 20 PeRcEnT) for thick barked individuals ( 18 mm) subjected to medium intensity fires and significantly decreased as a function of increasing tree diameter height and wood density. Hence fire induced tree mortality was influenced not only by cambium insulation but also by other traits that reduce the indirect effects of fire. These results can be used to improve assessments of fire vulnerability of tropical forests. 1132:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The persistence of rainforest patches at Fray Jorge National Park (FJNP) in semiarid Chile (30 degrees 40S) a region receiving approximately 147 mm of annual rainfall has been a source of concern among forest managers. These forests are likely dependent on water inputs from oceanic fog and their persistence seems uncertain in the face of climate change. Here we assessed tree radial growth and establishment during the last two centuries and their relation to trends in climate and canopy disturbance. Such evaluation is critical to understanding the dynamics of these semiarid ecosystems in response to climate change. We analyzed forest structure of six forest patches (0.2 22 ha) in FJNP based on sampling within 0.1 ha permanent plots. For the main canopy species the endemic Aextoxicon punctatum (Aextoxicaceae) we used tree ring analysis to assess establishment periods tree ages growing trends and their relation to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rainfall and disturbance. The population dynamics of A. punctatum can be described by a continuous regeneration mode. Regeneration of A. punctatum was sensitive to different canopy structures. Growth release patterns suggest the absence of large scale human impact. Radial growth and establishment of A. punctatum were weakly correlated with rainfall and ENSO. If water limits forests patch persistence patches are likely dependent on the combination of fog and rain water inputs. Forest patches have regenerated continuously for at least 250 years despite large fluctuations in rainfall driven by ENSO and a regional decline in rainfall during the last century. Because of the positive influence on fog interception forest structure should be preserved under any future climate scenario. Future research in FJNP should prioritize quantifying the long term trends of fog water deposition on forests patches. Fog modeling is crucial for understanding the interplay among physical drivers of water inputs under climate change. 1152:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The local distribution of woody vegetation affects most functional aspects of semiarid landscapes from soil erosion to nutrient cycling. With growing concern about anthropogenic climate change it has become critical to understand the ecological determinants of woody plant distribution in semiarid landscapes. However relatively little work has examined the determinants of local variation in woody cover. Here we examine water balance controls associated with patterns of tree cover density in a topographically complex semiarid woodland. Los Pinos Mountains Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge LTER New Mexico USA. To explore the relationship between local water balance variation and tree cover density we used a combination of high resolution (1 x 1 m) remotely sensed imagery and quantitative estimates of water balance variation in space and time. Regression tree analysis (RTA) was used to identify the environmental parameters that best predict variation in tree cover density. Using six predictor variables the RTA explains 39 PeRcEnT of the deviance in tree cover density over the landscape. The relationship between water balance conditions and tree cover density is highly contingent; that is similar tree cover densities occur under very different combinations of water balance parameters. Thus the effect of one environmental parameter on tree cover density depends on the values of other parameters. After tree cover density is adjusted for water balance conditions residual variation is related to tree cover density in the neighbourhood of a particular location. In semiarid landscapes vegetation structure is largely controlled by water supply and demand. Results presented here indicate that localized feedbacks and site specific historical processes are critical for understanding the responses of semiarid vegetation to climate change. 1154:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To provide the first global quantification of the slope and shape of the latitudinal gradient in seed mass and to determine whether global patterns in seed mass are best explained by growth form vegetation type seed dispersal syndrome or net primary productivity (NPP). Global. We collected seed mass data for 11 481 species x site combinations from around the world. We used regression to describe the latitudinal gradient in seed mass then applied general linear models to quantify the relative explanatory power of each of the variables hypothesized to underlie the latitudinal gradient in seed size. There is a 320 fold decline in geometric mean seed mass between the equator and 60 degrees. This decline is not linear. At the edge of the tropics there is a sudden 7 fold drop in mean seed mass. The strongest correlates of the latitudinal gradient in seed mass are plant growth form and vegetation type followed by dispersal syndrome and NPP. A model including growth form vegetation type dispersal syndrome and NPP explains 51 PeRcEnT of the variation in seed mass. Latitude explains just 0.2 PeRcEnT of the residual variation from this model. Main This is the first demonstration of a major decrease in seed size at the edge of the tropics. This drop in seed mass is most closely correlated with changes in plant growth form and vegetation type. This suggests that the drop in seed mass might be part of a sudden change in plant strategy at the edge of the tropics. 1156:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) was used to describe the relationship between savanna environments and vegetation community composition in the Orinoco Basin. TWINSPAN derived three major types of savanna vegetation each with its own Aoristic and physiognomic features. The first group reflected a plant association with species Trachypogon occurring in moderately infertile soils with low water availability and high bulk density. This group is distributed mostly on hilltops and dissected plains of the northern Orinoco savannas. The second group has the highest species diversity in habitats occurring in the northern Orinoco with extremely infertile soils. The third group on the other hand has a considerable number of species belonging to the leguminosae and Cyperaceae families and linked to the habitats of the eastern Colombian savannas with the highest soil water availability a shorter dry season and higher precipitation. The regional analysis of the Orinoco savannas suggests edaphic controls to be important. Changes in the underlying geology have affected topography and soil formation which results in variation in water and nutrient status. The moisture regime and hydrological features are acting as the major regional determinants while nutrient levels and distinctive surface soil properties provide the subregional determinants. The local boundary at any given site is strongly determined by nutrient shortage and acidity. Also biogeographic and floristic considerations were taken into account to explain differences in species composition. 1197:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Factors affecting the tree grass coexistence in savannas and consequences on the organic matter budgets were explored in this review. In savannas water and nutrients are commonly; limiting resources. and consequently the tree and grasses are interacting. However this interaction is only apparent since the tree grass competitors are coexisting in savanna vegetations which are characterized by a wide range of physionogmic types spanning herbaceous to woodland savannas. The tree grass coexistence is evident in climatic and edaphic savannas whereas in humidic and mesic savannas the fire factor controls tree density and its competitor ability depending upon the accumulation of organic matter. In order to explain the tree grass coexistence several hypotheses have been proposed. An exclusion solution due to competitor superiority of grasses has been proposed for dry savannas. As the water supply increases the grasses coexist by a spatial partitioning of the soil water resources. This equilibrium solution occurs by niche separation. Without ruling out these possibilities there exist savannas where trees and grasses are competing by limiting resources. The competitive abilities of trees and grasses differed in response to environmental features; thus coexistence is associated with niche difference. In disturbance prone savanna the mechanisms of the tree grass coexistence for the competing species is based on a reduction in tree grass competition due to control of tree density. Under savanna protection grasses are competitively excluded by trees as the life span of individuals is affected by the competitive interactions between trees and trees as well as trees and grasses. The causal mechanisms allowing tree grass coexistance in savannas were explored on the basis of the ecological hypothesis of system equilibrium or stability. The changes it? the proportion of the tree grass components affect the organic matter budget of the system. As a result of protection of the savannas vegetation is able to sequester significant quantities of carbon. The calculated sequestering pool of carbon in both the restored forest vegetation and soil would be 5.99 Pg C for a restoration time of 51 years. 1227:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent changes in land use have resulted in dramatic habitat loss for numerous species More than 99 PeRcEnT of the habitat for Fenders blue butterfly Icaricia icarioides fenderi an endangered butterfly in Oregon USA has been lost. Fenders blue butterflies require larval host plants (Kincaids lupine Lupinus sulphureus kincaidii) and nectar from native wildflowers. An experiment was conducted at two degraded sites near Eugene Oregon to investigate methods for restoration of Fenders blue habitat. The experimental design included four soil treatments (tilling reverse fertilization solarization and a control) combined with two planting treatments (50 PeRcEnT forb seed: 50 PeRcEnT grass seed and 10 PeRcEnT forb seed : 90 PeRcEnT grass seed) and two weeding treatments (weeding or not weeding). Treatments were replicated in eight experimental blocks (9 x 28 m) at each site. Seeds from 12 native plant species were field collected and sown in September 1995. Plant establishment was monitored in May 1996 1997 1998 and 1999. In 1999 flowers of all nectar species and leaves of Kincaids lupine were counted. Based on estimates of resource needs from previous work resources were evaluated as insufficient sufficient or ample. Solarization combined with 50 PeRcEnT forb : 50 PeRcEnT grass planting promoted sufficient nectar to sustain butterflies at both sites. Control treatments provided insufficient nectar at both sites. None of the treatments produced sufficient larval resources. This experiment demonstrates a method to quantitatively link habitat restoration to the resource needs of focal species. The results emphasize the importance of connecting restoration efforts to the life history features of focal species. In addition they highlight the importance of using experiments conducted across a range of sites to test restoration methods before large scale efforts are implemented. 1234:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Partitioning of available energy into sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat exchange was simultaneously measured in a closed Brachiaria field and an open neotropical savanna during the dry season of the Orinoco lowlands. These communities differing in canopy coverage and aerodynamic forcing conditions had major effects on the radiation and energy budgets. Thus in the Brachiaria canopy seasonally averaged daily LE was 55 PeRcEnT (6.635 0.92 MJ m( 2) day( 1)) of the seasonally averaged daily available energy. In the savanna it was 30 PeRcEnT (2.841 0.65 MJ m( 2) day( 1)). The high degree of coupling between the Brachiaria and savanna surfaces to the prevailing weather of the dry season as expressed by the seasonally averaged daily omega factor (Omega equals 0.056 0.005 and 0.042 0.003 respectively) indicates that LE depended on the atmospheric driving potential and the canopy conductance (gc) to vapor diffusion. Consequently daily LE was proportional to the imposed evapotranspiration rate. The hourly LE measured LE equilibrium ratio for the Brachiaria canopy was logarithmically related to the canopy resistance (rc); in the savanna the ratio was exponentially related to re with a threshold value ranging from 60 to 90 s m( 1). This contrasting behavior was unrelated to plant water status as maximum hourly leaf water potential in both canopies was on average similar ( 0.7 to 0.8 MPa). The difference between the two canopies in the control exerted by the canopy conductance on water losses was associated with the size of the evaporating surface and the proportional contribution of the foliage and the dry soil resistance. 1250:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Aims To identify approaches to improve our understanding of and predictive capability for mixed tree grass systems. Elucidation of the interactions dynamics and determinants and identification of robust generalizations that can be broadly applied to tree grass systems would benefit ecological theory modelling and land management. A series of workshops brought together scientific expertise to review theory data availability modelling approaches and key questions. Ecosystems characterized by mixtures of herbaceous and woody plant life forms often termed savannas range from open grasslands with few woody plants to woodlands or forests with a grass layer. These ecosystems represent a substantial portion of the terrestrial biosphere an important wildlife habitat and a major resource for provision of livestock fuel wood and other products. Although many concepts and principles developed for grassland and forest systems are relevant to these dual life form communities the novel complex nonlinear behaviour of mixed tree grass systems cannot be accounted for by simply studying or modelling woody and herbaceous components independently. A more robust understanding requires addressing three fundamental conundrums: (1) The treeness conundrum. What controls the relative abundance of woody and herbaceous plants for a given set of conditions at given site? (2) The coexistence conundrum. How do the life forms interact with each other? Is a given woody herbaceous ratio dynamically stable and persistent under a particular set of conditions? (3) The net primary productivity (NPP) conundrum. How does NPP of the woody vegetation the herbaceous vegetation and the total ecosystem (woody herbaceous) change with changes in the tree grass ratio? Tests of the theory and conceptual models of determinants of mixed woody herbaceous systems have been largely site or region specific and have seldom been broadly or quantitatively evaluated. Cross site syntheses based on data and modelling are required to address the conundrums and identify emerging patterns yet there are very few data sets for which either biomass or NPP have been quantified for both the woody and the herbaceous components of tree grass systems. Furthermore there are few cross site comparisons spanning the diverse array of woody herbaceous mixtures. Hence initial synthesis studies should focus on compiling and standardizing a global data base which could be (1) explored to ascertain if robust generalizations and consistent patterns exist; and (2) used to evaluate the performance of savanna simulation models over a range of woody herbaceous mixtures. Savanna structure and productivity are the result of complex and dynamic interactions between climate soils and disturbances notably fire and herbivory. Such factors are difficult to isolate or experimentally manipulate in order to evaluate their impacts at spatial and temporal scales appropriate for assessing ecosystem dynamics. These factors can however be evaluated with simulation models. Existing savanna models vary markedly with respect to their conceptual approach their data requirements and the extent to which they incorporate mechanistic processes. Model intercomparisons can elucidate those approaches most suitable for various research questions and management applications. Theoretical and conceptual advances could be achieved by considering a broad continuum of grass shrub tree combinations using data meta analysis techniques and modelling. 1257:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In water limited environments the availability of water and nutrients to plants depends on environmental conditions sizes and shapes of their root systems and root competition. The goal of this study was to predict root system sizes and shapes for different plant growth forms using data on above ground plant sizes climate and soil texture. A new data set of  1300 records of root system sizes for individual plants was collected from the literature for deserts scrublands grasslands and savannas with :5 1000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). Maximum rooting depths maximum lateral root spreads and their ratios were measured. Root system sizes differed among growth forms and increased with above ground size: annuals   perennial forbs equals grasses   semi shrubs   shrubs   trees. Stem succulents were as shallowly rooted as annuals but had lateral root spreads similar to shrubs. Absolute rooting depths increased with MAP in all growth forms except shrubs and trees but were not strongly related to potential evapotranspiration (PET). Except in trees root systems tended to be shallower and wider in dry and hot climates and deeper and narrower in cold and wet climates. Shrubs were more shallowly rooted under climates with summer than winter precipitation regimes. Relative to above ground plant sizes root system sizes decreased with increasing PET for all growth forms but decreased with increasing MAP only for herbaceous plants. Thus relative rooting depths tended to increase with aridity although absolute rooting depths decreased with aridity. Using an independent data set of 20 test locations rooting depths were predicted from MAP using regression models for three broad growth forms. The models succeeded in explaining 62 PeRcEnT of the observed variance in median rooting depths. Based on the data analysed here Walters two layer model of soil depth partitioning between woody and herbaceous plants appears to be most appropriate in drier regimes (  500 mm MAP ) and in systems with substantial winter precipitation. 1258:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plants may not occur in a given area if there are no suitable sites for seeds to establish (microsite limitation) if seeds fail to arrive in suitable microsites (dispersal limitation) or if seeds in suitable microsites are destroyed by predators (predator limitation). We conducted a large scale study to determine the importance of dispersal limitation and predator limitation in affecting the distribution of pokeweed Phytolacca americana in 401 ha experimental patches arrayed in eight groups of five patches distributed across a 300 km(2) region. Microsite limitation was minimized by clearcutting and burning existing vegetation creating the type of disturbed habitat in which P. americana readily germinates and establishes. The role of dispersal limitation was examined by adding approximately 7000 seeds to each of eight patches in March 2000. The role of seed predation was examined in all 40 patches using experimental exclosures from June 2000 to July 2001. The number of P. americana plants in September 2000 was unchanged by seed addition. However fewer P. americana plants were found in patches where seed predators removed more P. americana seeds from experimental exclosures. These data suggest that P. americana is not limited by seed dispersal. Rather in habitats where microsites are readily available the abundance of P. americana among patches appears to be limited by the activities of seed predators. When dispersal and microsites are not limiting the role of local seed predators can be important for generating emergent large scale patterns of plant abundance across landscapes. Moreover because predators may generate large scale patterns that resemble other forms of limitation and predators may target specific species predator impacts should be more frequently incorporated into experiments on the role of seed limitation and plant community composition. 1259:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent studies have documented local scale associations between tree species and topographic and edaphic habitat types in forests worldwide. To determine whether such associations form at early life stages we compared species positive associations with five habitat types (high plateau low plateau slope streamside and swamp) at two life stages for 80 tree and shrub species in a Panamanian lowland forest. Nineteen significant positive habitat associations were detected at the small tree stage (seedlings and saplings   20 cm tall and   1 cm d.b.h.) and 18 at the large tree stage (individuals   1 cm d.b.h.) according to results of torus translation randomization tests. The majority of species did not show consistent associations at the two stages. Of the 30 species significantly associated with a habitat only five were associated with the same habitat at both stages. Overall more species were associated with the wetter slope habitat at the large tree stage compared with the small tree stage. For a subset of species we examined the relationship between observed habitat associations and seed dispersal and seedling establishment patterns by using species specific seed dispersal kernels to predict seed rain into each habitat. Two thirds of species associated with a habitat at the large tree stage had higher predicted seed densities in the associated habitat relative to other habitat types indicating that limited seed dispersal acts to reinforce habitat associations for most species. In contrast only one third of the species associated with a habitat at the large tree stage showed evidence of higher seedling establishment rates in the associated habitat compared with other habitats and an equal number of species appeared to have lower rates of establishment in the habitat that large trees of the species were associated with. Overall our results indicate that habitat associations of large trees typically do not form at early life stages. Rather many species appear to exhibit different ecological habitat preferences across life stages. Future studies of species habitat associations should therefore include multiple life stages in order to detect developmental shifts in ecological preferences. 1260:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Density dependent survival is prevalent in tropical forests and is recognized as a potentially important mechanism for maintaining tree species diversity. However there is little knowledge of how density dependence changes in fluctuating environments. Across the 20 ha Xishuangbanna tropical seasonal rain forest dynamics plot in southwest China which has distinct dry and wet seasons we monitored seedling survival in 453 1 m2 quadrats over 2 years. Density dependence was assessed using generalized linear mixed models with crossed random effects. When pooling all species at the community level there were strong negative effects of conspecific tree neighbours on seedling survival over the dry season wet season and 2 year intervals. The proportion of conspecific seedling neighbours had a significant negative effect in the dry season but not in the wet season. At the species level the effects of conspecific tree and seedling neighbours varied widely among species in the community and were significantly positively related to population basal area in the community over the dry season interval. In contrast over the wet season interval the effects of conspecific tree and seedling neighbours did not significantly vary among species in the community. Overall community and species level results suggest that local scale negative density dependence (NDD) tends to be stronger in the dry than wet season in the Xishuangbanna tropical forest. At the scale of the 20 ha plot we found a community compensatory trend (CCT) in which rare species had relatively higher seedling survival than common species in both the wet and dry seasons. A positive association between potential NDD and population basal area suggests that the CCT results from local scale NDD specifically because of negative effects of conspecific tree neighbours. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the strength of density dependent seedling survival can vary between seasons and among species in tropical forests. Future research is needed to assess the underlying mechanisms of this temporal and interspecific variation in NDD and its consequences for species coexistence and community composition. 1264:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We investigated the relationships of seed size dispersal mode and other species characteristics to interspecific variation in mean primary seed dispersal distances mean annual seed production per unit basal area and clumping of seed deposition among 41 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island Panama. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating interannual variation in seed production was used to estimate seed dispersal seed production and clumping of seed rain for each species from 19 years of data for 188 seed traps on a 50 ha plot in which all adult trees were censused every 5 years. Seed dispersal was modelled as a two dimensional Students T distribution with the degrees of freedom parameter fixed at 3 interannual variation in seed production per basal area was modelled as a lognormal and the clumping of seed rain around its expected value was modelled as a negative binomial distribution. There was wide variation in seed dispersal distances among species sharing the same mode of seed dispersal. Seed dispersal mode did not explain significant variation in seed dispersal distances but did explain significant variation in clumping: animal dispersed species showed higher clumping of seed deposition. Among nine wind dispersed species the combination of diaspore terminal velocity tree height and wind speed in the season of peak dispersal explained 40 PeRcEnT of variation in dispersal distances. Among 31 animal dispersed species 20 PeRcEnT of interspecific variation in dispersal distances was explained by seed mass (a negative effect) and tree height (a positive effect). Among all species seed mass tree height and dispersal syndrome explained 28 PeRcEnT of the variation in mean dispersal distance and seed mass alone explained 45 PeRcEnT of the variation in estimated seed production per basal area. Synthesis. There is wide variation in patterns of primary seed rain among tropical tree species. Substantial proportions of interspecific variation in seed production seed dispersal distances and clumping of seed deposition are explained by relatively easily measured plant traits especially dispersal mode seed mass and tree height. This provides hope for trait based generalization and modelling of seed dispersal in tropical forests. 1265:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P  Many hypotheses about species coexistence involve differential resource use and trade offs in species life history traits. Quantifying resource use across most species in diverse communities although has seldom been attempted. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the light dependence of recruitment in 263 woody species in a 50 ha long term forest census plot in Panama. Data on sapling recruitment were obtained using the 1985 1990 and 1990 1995 census intervals. Available light was estimated for each recruit from yearly censuses of canopy density. We use a power function (linear log log relationship) to model the light effect on recruitment. Different responses of recruitment to light are expressed by the light effect parameter b. The distribution of b had a central mode at 0.8 suggesting that recruitment of many species responds nearly linearly to increasing light. Nearly every species showed increases in recruitment with increasing light. Just nine species (3 PeRcEnT) had recruitment declining with light while 198 species (75 PeRcEnT) showed increasing recruitment in both census intervals. Most of the increases in recruitment were decelerating the increase was less at higher light (b   1). In the remaining species the response to light varied between census intervals (24 species) or species did not have recruits in both intervals (41 species). Synthesis. Nearly all species regenerate better in higher light and recruitment responses to light are spread along a continuum ranging from modest increase with light to a rather strict requirement for high light. These results support the hypothesis that spatio temporal variation in light availability may contribute to the diversity of tropical tree species by providing opportunities for niche differentiation with respect to light requirements for regeneration. 1304:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Artificial dens constructed for eastern woodrats (Neotoma floridana) were occupied readily by animals and thus their caches were available for repeated sampling over winter. Caches contained significantly fewer kilocalories in spring than in winter ((X) over bar SE winter equals 6 808.6 637.08 kcal spring equals 2 556.8 319.12 kcal). Male and female woodrats using artificial dens did not differ significantly in weight or in the kilocalories available in their caches in winter or spring. Additionally woodrats did not change significantly in weight from autumn to spring and the weights of individual woodrats were not correlated with the kilocalories available in their caches. Of the 17 different types of food found in the caches in artificial dens seven (dicot leaves Osage orange seed honey locust seed bark on stored twigs and sticks herbaceous plant material red cedar leaves and grass) were in five or more of the 12 dens. A few food items such as Osage orange seeds were cached by all woodrats but the variety of other items appeared to depend on availability of food sources within foraging ranges of individuals. 1311:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examined food habits of Brazilian free tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) at 3 colonies in central Texas over 3 summers. Fecal samples collected from 1 550 bats contained remains of 12 orders and 35 families of insects documenting the most diverse diet ever reported in insect eating bats. Daily and seasonal patterns of insect consumption were similar at the 3 sites and closely correlated to patterns of emergence migration and availability of adult populations of corn earworms Helicoverpa zea and fall armyworms Spodoptera frugiperda both species of noctuid moths and major crop pests. The percentage of feces volume comprised by moth remains increased from 14.8 PeRcEnT 2.1 SE (range: 6.3 43.7 PeRcEnT) to 43.0 PeRcEnT 7.1 (range: 1.7 73.5 PeRcEnT) in samples collected at midnight versus dawn on days when large influxes of migratory moths arrived in Texas in early morning following their massive emergence from northern Mexico. Daily patterns diminished later in the season after moth populations became established in local crops and were available in large numbers throughout night. Moth consumption decreased in both evening and dawn feeding periods when crops senesced and moth populations declined. These and other data suggest that crop pests comprise a substantial portion of the bats diet and that bats provide valuable natural pest control services. 1321:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The long term effects of changing fire regimes on the herbaceous component of savannas are poorly understood but essential for understanding savanna dynamics. We present results from one of the longest running (  44 years) fire experiments in savannas the experimental burn plots (EBPs) which is located in the Kruger National Park (South Africa) and encompasses four major savanna vegetation types that span broad spatial gradients of rainfall (450 700 mm) and soil fertility. Herbaceous vegetation was sampled twice in the EBPs using a modified step point method once prior to initiation of the experiment (1954) and again after 44 47 years. Different combinations of three fire frequency (1 2 and 3 year return intervals) and five season (before the first spring rains after the first spring rains mid summer late summer and autumn) treatments as well as a fire exclusion treatment were applied at the plot level (similar to 7 ha each) with each treatment (n equals 12 total) replicated four times at each of the four sites (n equals 192 plots total). The effects of long term alterations to the fire regime on grass community structure and composition were analyzed separately for each site. Over the 44 years duration of the experiment fires were consistently more intense on sites with higher mean annual rainfall (  570 mm) whereas fires were not as intense or consistent for sites with lower and more variable rainfall (  510 mm) and potentially higher herbivory due to greater soil fertility. Because the plots were open to grazing the impacts of herbivory along with more variable rainfall regimes likely minimized the effects of fire for the more arid sites. As a consequence fire effects on grass community structure and composition were most marked for the higher rainfall sites and generally not significant for the more arid sites. For the high rainfall sites frequent dry season fires (1 to 3 year return intervals) resulted in high grass richness evenness and diversity whereas fire exclusion and growing season fires had the lowest of these measures and diverged the most in composition as the result of increased abundance of a few key grasses. Overall the long term cumulative impacts of altered fire regimes varied across broad climatic and fertility gradients with fire effects on the grass community decreasing in importance and herbivory and climatic variability likely having a greater influence on community structure and composition with increasing aridity and soil fertility. 1322:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Aims We present an improved model for the growth of individuals in plant populations experiencing competition. Individuals grow sigmoidally according to the Birch model which is similar to the more commonly used Richards model but has the advantage that initial plant growth is always exponential. The individual plant growth models are coupled so that there is a maximum total biomass for the population. The effects of size asymmetric competition are modeled with a parameter that reflects the size advantage that larger individual have over smaller individuals. We fit the model the data on individual growth in crowded populations of Chenopodium album. Important Findings When individual plant growth curves were not coupled there was a negative or no correlation between initial growth rate and final size suggesting that competitive interactions were more important in determining final plant size than were plants initial growth rates. The coupled growth equations fit the data better than individual uncoupled growth models even though the number of estimated parameters in the coupled competitive growth model was far fewer indicating the importance of modeling competition and the degree of size asymmetric growth explicitly. A quantitative understanding of stand development in terms of the growth of individuals as altered by competition is within reach. 132:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  When ecologically important plant traits are correlated they may be said to constitute an ecological strategy dimension. Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits and thus the strategy dimensions they represented across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests. Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA) the average size of leaves seed and fruit typical maximum plant height and wood density (WD). Trait relationships were quantified across species at each individual forest as well as across the dataset as a whole. Phylogenetic analyses were used to test for correlations among evolutionary trait divergences and to ascertain whether interspecific relationships were biased by strong taxonomic patterning in the traits. The interspecific and phylogenetic analyses yielded congruent results. Seed and fruit size were expected and confirmed to be tightly related. As expected plant height was correlated with each of seed and fruit size albeit weakly. Weak support was found for an expected positive relationship between leaf and fruit size. The prediction that SLA and WD would be negatively correlated was not supported. Otherwise the traits were predicted to be largely unrelated being representatives of putatively independent strategy dimensions. This was indeed the case although WD was consistently negatively related to leaf size. The dimensions represented by SLA seed fruit size and leaf size were essentially independent and thus conveyed largely independent information about plant strategies. To a lesser extent the same was true for plant height and WD. Our tentative explanation for negative WD leaf size relationships now also known from other habitats is that the traits are indirectly linked via plant hydraulics. 1336:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fungi are a significant source of seed mortality. Although the seeds of pokeweed Phytolacca americana are known to contain antifungal compounds it is unknown if these compounds confer the presumed benefit of increased persistence of P. americana seeds in soil compared to seeds of potential competitors. We buried seeds of P. americana with seeds of a sympatric species Chamaecrista fasciculata that is not known to exhibit antifungal properties. Half of the buried seeds were treated with a fungicide. After three months seeds were exhumed. Treatment of buried seeds with fungicide significantly increased the number of intact C fasciculata seeds recovered (82 PeRcEnT recovered with fungicide addition 39 PeRcEnT recovered from controls). Recovery of intact P. americana seeds was 100 PeRcEnT for both control and fungicide treatments. Results from a complementary experiment using non buried seeds in a growth chamber experiment confirmed that P. americana was much less susceptible to fungal attack compared to C. fasciculata. Our work demonstrates that the antifungal properties of P. americana significantly improved survival of P. americana seeds in the seedbank. Moreover this increased survival may promote P. americana persistence in communities where species without antifungal properties such as C. fasciculata also exist. 1348:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Secondary forests occupy a growing portion of the tropical landscape mosaic due to regeneration on abandoned pastures and other disturbed sites. Tropical secondary forests and degraded old growth forests now account for more than half of the worlds tropical forests and provide critical ecosystem services. An increasing body of research has explored the convergence of tropical secondary forest structure and composition with that of comparable old growth forests. However successional trajectories of tropical secondary forests can vary significantly due to differing land use histories and proximity to neighbouring forests that can serve as seed sources for regeneration. While some regenerating secondary forests appear to be converging on characteristics of old growth forests others appear to form novel forests that differ from the sites original forest communities. As a growing portion of the worlds tropical forests are regenerating information on their recovery and functioning is critical. Forest regeneration depends on seed arrival successful seedling establishment and growth. Seed arrival is typically related to proximity to old growth or secondary forests. However even in cases with adequate seed sources conditions in regenerating secondary forest may prevent seedling establishment or persistence. Delayed or arrested succession can follow whereby a secondary forest experiences indefinite suppression of a return to forest structure and composition considered representative of the old growth forest in the area. We compare patterns of seedling regeneration in contiguous old growth and secondary forest patches in a small forest fragment in Singapore. This small tropical island has experienced notable losses to its floristic and faunal diversity owing to a near total conversion of forest to anthropogenic use. Despite these losses small reserves on the island remain and are of critical importance in biodiversity maintenance. The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (BTNR; 1 21 N 103 46 E) was initially designated a forest reserve in 1887 and survived subsequent revocation of its protected status illegal logging and occupation during World War II prior to its final recognition as a nature reserve in 1951. BTNR contains the only significant patch of undisturbed forest remaining on the island covering 164 ha of lowland and coastal hill dipterocarp forest. The reserve is isolated due to surrounding development including highways shopping centres and residential growth. It is separated from one additional adjoining forest fragment by a major highway. A centrally located area of 71 ha within the reserve has experienced limited anthropogenic disturbance but remained free of logging and is considered a mix of old growth and secondary forest. In 1993 the Center for Tropical Forest Science established a 2 ha permanent forest dynamics plot in old growth forest at BTNR with a nearly adjacent ( 50 m) 2 ha secondary forest plot added in 2004. The secondary forest has a complex disturbance history that likely resulted in severe degradation or complete loss of organic soil in many places. Clearing terracing and agriculture appear to have persisted from the mid 1800s into the 1950s with incorporation into the reserve in 1962. It is now characterized by secondary disturbance adapted species such as Dillenia suffruticosa (Dilleniaceae) Adinandra dumosa (Theaceae) and Campnosperma auriculata (Anacardiaceae; LaFrankie . 2005). Within the secondary forest plot we also distinguished between secondary and a more degraded secondary forest area. The degraded forest has a lower more open canopy and includes understorey patches of ferns Dicranopteris spp. (Gleicheniaceae) and the pitcher plant Nepenthes gracilis (Nepenthaceae) both indicators of higher light and poorer soil characteristics. In January 2005 we established 1 m2 sample quadrats at 5 m intervals along 50 m transects spaced parallel to each other 10 m apart in the old growth forest plot and along similar transects spaced 5mapart in the secondary forest plot. We sampled 200 plots in the old growth forest 140 in the secondary forest and 180 in the degraded secondary forest. Plots occurring on a trail were excluded. Within each quadrat all free standing woody seedlings 20 cm tall and 1 cmdbh were counted and measured and broken stems were noted. In a subset of the quadrats (100 in old growth forest 70 in secondary and 130 in degraded) we semi quantitatively assigned average leaf litter depth within the plot to the following categories: low (0 4 cm) medium (4 8 cm) and high ( 8 cm). Variation in seedling density (counts per seedling plot) among forest types and leaf litter categories was analyzed with generalized linear models (GLM) with negative binomial errors (which performed better than Poisson errors based on preliminary tests). Significance was assessed using Chi squared likelihood ratio (LR) tests to compare models with and without forest type and leaf litter category. Differences among forest types in the proportion of seedling plots falling into each leaf litter depth category was tested using a chi squared contingency table test. We used GLM with binomial errors to test for variation in the proportion of broken stems among forest types. Analyses were performed in R 2.10.0. Seedling density varied significantly among forest types (LR 2 equals 180 P   0.001) with mean seedling density highest in the old growth forest and lowest in the degraded secondary forest. Across all forest types seedling density also decreased with increasing leaf litter depth (LR 2 equals 71.4 P   0.001). The best fit model for seedling density included both leaf litter depth (LR 2 45.5 P 0.001) and forest type (LR 2 20.7 P   0.001) but no interaction term (LR 2 equals 7.37 P equals 0.12). Litter depth varied significantly among forest types ( 2 equals 100 df equals 4 P   0.001). In old growth forest 64 PeRcEnT of seedling plots had low leaf litter depths compared to 23 PeRcEnT and 6 PeRcEnT in secondary and degraded forest areas. The percentage of plots with deep leaf litter was greatest in the degraded forest. Seedling height also differed significantly among forest types (Kruskal Wallis 2 equals 9.62 df equals 2 P equals 0.008). Mean seedling height (__ 1 SE) was higher in old growth forest (790 __ 27 mm) than in secondary (629 __ 53 mm) and degraded forest areas (579__68 mm). Relatively few seedlings  1 m tall were encountered in secondary and degraded forest areas compared with old growth forest. The smaller seedling heights in secondary and degraded forest were not due to higher stem breakage since the proportion of broken stems was higher in old growth forest (16.4 PeRcEnT) than in secondary (11.5 PeRcEnT) and degraded (1.8 PeRcEnT) areas and varied significantly among the forest types (deviance equals 12.7 df equals 2 P equals 0.002). Differences in proportion of broken stems are likely explained by the higher number of canopy trees in old growth forest resulting in more branches breaking young seedlings as they fall from the canopy. Seedling density at BTNR was significantly lower in secondary forest as compared with old growth forest and even lower in the degraded secondary. This finding is contrary to previous studies that reported higher seedling densities in secondary forests compared with later successional or old growth forests presumably due to greater canopy openness that facilitates higher light availability. Light is commonly considered a limiting factor for seedling establishment and growth in closed canopy tropical forests. Moreover seedlings in the secondary and degraded secondary forests were smaller than those in old growth forest suggesting barriers to seedling establishment and growth. Higher leaf litter depths in the degraded and secondary forest likely contributed to the lower seedling densities found in these areas. The deeper leaf litter is a result of prolific litter production by C. auriculatum and D. suffruticosa which may then resist decomposition due to intrinsic properties or due to forest conditions  lower humidity). Leaf litter can serve as both a physical and chemical barrier to successful seedling recruitment by physically impeding growth disrupting light availability and wavelengths or through leaching of allelopathic chemicals. Leaf litter can reduce seed germination in BTNR. While there was some evidence that reduced seedling density was related to litter layer depth the best model for seedling density also included forest type indicating that increased litter depth in secondary forest types relative to old growth forest only partially explains differences in seedling density. High leaf litter depths in the degraded secondary forest are compounded by fern patches which have thick root mats and are likely allelopathic inhibiting seed germination and shading out seedlings. Other factors likely contribute to the observed differences in seedling density and height including seed availability seed dispersal and the ability of seedlings to establish and persist. Although there is a lack of reproductive size trees in the secondary forest types that likely limits the secondary forest seed pool the close proximity of old growth forest might provide sufficient seed sources. However dispersal from old growth into secondary forest is almost certainly impacted by the major loss of local fauna at this site. Small seeded plants the most likely to be dispersed are the least likely to germinate in thick litter. Moreover the secondary forest types have landuse histories that likely resulted in soil degradation. Local soils subject to fire and agriculture are nutrient poor and have low pH. Seedling growth in BTNR is limited by nutrient availability in old growth forest and this is likely to be even more severe in secondary forest which may help explain observed differences in size class distributions. Ultimately the impacts of reduced reproductive capacity a depauperate disperser fauna and altered litter and soil characteristics are all likely to be contributors to the observed differences. The secondary and degraded secondary forests have not been subject to disturbance for over 50 y; however they remain significantly different from adjacent old growth forest. The observed lack of seedling recruitment in the secondary and degraded forests may represent a state of delayed or arrested succession. Succession in degraded lands in Singapore appears to be an extremely slow process perhaps requiring  100 y to reach secondary forest. If the regeneration of diverse and stable forest within BTNR is presently impeded as our results suggest then active management of the reserve may be warranted; accelerating succession in secondary forest would effectively provide a larger refuge. Future research should focus on the mechanisms inhibiting seedling regeneration and explore the possibility of applied restoration to accelerate secondary forest succession and recovery. 1349:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the progress made in understanding the ecophysiology of tropical plants during the past two decades questions regarding relationships between the environment and physiological diversity remain. It is now recognized that tropical climate can be quite variable which could lead to significant functional diversity (increased variation in life history traits) among species due to the tight association between gas exchange physiology and the environment . It remains unclear however how the subtleties of variation in tropical climate and tree life history traits are related to the functional diversity of tropical communities . The stable carbon isotope composition ( 13C) of plant tissue can be used to quantify certain aspects of functional diversity among species. 13C has been suggested as a surrogate for water use efficiency (WUE the ratio of carbon gained to water lost during gas exchange) . Generally plants with high 13C are thought to have high WUE while those with low 13C have low WUE. Several researchers have examined 13C values in tropical forests (see Martinelli . 1998) however additional studies are necessary to fully understand the extent of 13C variation and its correlates. In this study we compare variation in 13C among co occurring tropical dry forest species of north western Costa Rica in order to quantify functional diversity. The goals of this study are to present 13C data from the dominant species in this region; determine if the 13C variation among these species is related to functional differences in phenology (evergreen or deciduous) canopy position (emergent or understorey) and leaf morphology (soft or coriaceous); and place our data in the context of other tropical forest 13C studies. 1350:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatial and temporal variation in seedling dynamics was assessed using records of community wide seedling demography collected with identical monitoring methods at four tropical lowland forests in Panama Malaysia Ecuador and French Guiana for periods of between 3 and 10 y. At each site the fates of between 8617 and 391 777 seedlings were followed through annual censuses of the 370 1.008 1 m(2) seedling plots. Within site spatial and inter annual variation in density recruitment growth and mortality was compared with among site variability using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to determine the generality of each sites patterns and potential for meaningful comparisons among sites. The Malaysian forest which experiences community wide masting was the most variable in both seedling density and recruitment. However density varied year to year at all sites (CV(among years at site) equals 8 43 PeRcEnT) driven largely by high variability in recruitment rates (CV equals 40 117 PeRcEnT). At all sites recruitment was more variable than mortality (CV equals 5 64 PeRcEnT) or growth (CV equals 12 51 PeRcEnT). Increases in mortality rates lagged I y behind large recruitment events. Within site spatial variation and inter annual differences were greater than differences among site averages in all rates emphasizing the value of long term comparative studies when generalizing how spatial and temporal variation drive patterns of recruitment in tropical forests. 1351:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The influence of local precipitation and temperature on long term growth dynamics in two species of seasonally dry tropical forest trees were investigated. Growth records were extracted from tree rings in Guanacaste province Costs Rica. These chronologies provide a long term (c. 85 y) record of tree growth for two species with contrasting phenologies. Annual growth in both species was dependent on annual and or monthly variation in local precipitation but less so on temperature. For each species however patterns of growth reflected unique degrees of sensitivity to monthly rainfall and rainfall during previous years. It is hypothesized that such differences were due to the rooting depth of these species. A review of the literature also indicated similar diverse cambial growth responses by tropical trees to variation in annual and monthly climate. Lastly it was shown that variation in longer term fluctuations in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans as measured by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) significantly influenced local precipitation in Guanacaste only during the wettest portion of the wet season. Such temporal sensitivity may have differentially influenced the longer term growth of some tropical tree species but not others. Together these results support the hypothesis that tropical tree species respond individualistically to variation in local and regional climate and that some tropical assemblages may in fact be structured by species specific differences in soil water use. 138:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,138:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, For many years biologists have debated whether mast seeding (the synchronous intermittent production of large seed crops in perennial plants) results from weather conditions or is an evolved plant reproductive strategy. In this review we analyze the evidence for the underlying causes of masting. In the absence of selection for higher or lower variability plants will vary in tandem with the environment (resource matching). Two selective factors often favor the evolution of masting: increased pollination efficiency in wind pollinated species and satiation of seed predators. Other factors select against masting including animal pollination and frugivore dispersal. A survey of 570 masting datasets shows that wind pollinated species had higher seed production coefficients of variation (CVs) than biotically pollinated ones. Frugivore dispersed species had low CVs whereas predator dispersed plants had high CVs consistent with gaining benefits from predator satiation rather than dispersal. The global pattern of masting shows highest seed crop variability at mid latitudes and in the Southern Hemisphere which are similar to the patterns in variability of rainfall. We conclude that masting is often an adaptive reproductive trait overlaid on the direct influence of weather. 1442:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Reich . report that the whole plant respiration rate R in seedlings scales linearly with plant mass M so that R equals cRM when 1 in which cR is the scaling normalization and is the scaling exponent. They also state that because nitrogen concentration (N) is correlated with cR variation in N is a better predictor of R than M would be. Reich . and Hedin incorrectly claim that these universal findings question the central tenet of metabolic scaling theory which they interpret as predicting equals . irrespective of the size of the plant. Here we show that these conclusions misrepresent metabolic scaling theory and that their results are actually consistent with this theory. Reich . and Hedin do not cite an explicit caveat in metabolic scaling theory that will deviate from . in plants that violate the secondary optimizing assumptions including small plants such as seedlings and saplings. The core assumption of this theory states that carbon assimilation by the whole plant or gross photosynthesis P stem fluid flow rate Q0 and that the number (nL) and mass of leaves (ML) all co vary and scale together as R P Q0 nL ML M in which is derived from vascular network geometry dynamics and biomechanics. Specifically equals 1 (2a b) in which a characterizes the branch radii r between different branching levels k (that is k: rk 1 rk n a); b characterizes the ratio of branch lengths l between levels (that is lk 1 lk n b)3 6; and n is the branching ratio. The equals . rule then originates from secondary assumptions whereby the branching network is volume filling; hydrodynamic resistance is minimized; the terminal branch (that is ML RL PL QL) is independent of M; and biomechanical adaptations negate the effects of gravity. Together these assumptions lead to a equals . b equals and consequently equals . Violations of any of these assumptions yield different values of a and or b and hence of . Isometric scaling relationships for small plants are the result of such violations. For small plants gravity is relatively unimportant so rk lk and a rather than a equals . Also there are few branching levels so space filling is incomplete and b   . Thus metabolic scaling theory predicts that 1 for the extreme case of very small plants. However as plants grow gravity becomes increasingly important and volume filling architecture develops so metabolic scaling theory predicts a shift in from 1 to . Independent data sets support these predictions. First intraspecific scaling of metabolism8 from saplings to trees is closer to . than to 1. Second intra and interspecific scaling of ML all show4 a transition from 1 in seedlings to . in larger plants. Furthermore the data of Reich . for R show a shift from 1 for seedlings to . for saplings that have an above ground biomass of more than 30 g ( equals 0.78 0.08 r2 equals 0.86). Reich . do not cite studies of plants larger than seedlings which show the predicted . power scaling for ML Q0 carbon growth rate (G equals P R) and chlorophyll concentration. Thus within each of their experimental treatments extrapolation of isometric scaling of R to plants larger than seedlings will erroneously predict that the ratio of R G should increase as R G M1 M. equals M. and an unrealistic maximum plant size. Metabolic scaling theory resolves these inconsistencies by showing that R P Qo nL so that R G is invariant with size from seedlings to trees as observed. Reich . point to the correlation between R and N as an alternative scaling mechanism. This is problematic and misleading. First the literature on leaf level physiology shows that R N cannot be assumed to apply to whole plants. Nitrogen is present in varying concentrations in all structures so it is unclear how N scales. As size increases the metabolically inert pith and heartwood constitute an increasing fraction of biomass but the fraction of nitrogen rich leaves decreases as M . . Second work extending metabolic scaling theory anticipated their result by showing how variation in nutrients influence R and related rates by changing the intercept of the predicted cR as observed. For both plants and animals metabolic scaling theory provides a general mechanistic baseline theory to predict how the scaling of metabolism is linked to the geometry and scaling of branching vascular networks temperature and nutrient stoichiometry __ that is nitrogen concentration. As a result metabolic scaling theory can successfully resolve apparent exceptions and deviations including isometric scaling in seedlings.  1454:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A recent tsunami(1 2) and an apparent increase in the frequency of severe tropical storms(3 5) underscore the need to understand and predict the ecological consequences of major hydrodynamic disturbances(6). Reef corals provide the habitat structure that sustains the high biodiversity of tropical reefs(7) and thus provide the foundation for the ecosystem goods and services that are critical to many tropical societies(6 8). Here we integrate predictions from oceanographic models(9) with engineering theory to predict the dislodgement of benthic reef corals during hydrodynamic disturbances. This generalizes earlier work(10 11) by incorporating colonies of any shape and by explicitly examining the effects of hydrodynamic gradients on coral assemblage structure. Afield test shows that this model accurately predicts changes in the mechanical vulnerability of coral colonies and thus their size and shape with distance from the reef crest. This work provides a general framework for understanding and predicting the effects of hydrodynamic disturbances on coral reef communities; such disturbances have a major role in determining species zonation(12 13) and coexistence(14) on coral reefs and are critical determinants of how coral assemblages will respond to changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms associated with a changing climate(3 5 15). 1457:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although patterns of tree species distributions along environmental gradients have been amply documented in tropical forests(1 7) mechanisms causing these patterns are seldom known. Efforts to evaluate proposed mechanisms have been hampered by a lack of comparative data on species reactions to relevant axes of environmental variation(1). Here we show that differential drought sensitivity shapes plant distributions in tropical forests at both regional and local scales. Our analyses are based on experimental field assessments of drought sensitivity of 48 species of trees and shrubs and on their local and regional distributions within a network of 122 inventory sites spanning a rainfall gradient across the Isthmus of Panama. Our results suggest that niche differentiation with respect to soil water availability is a direct determinant of both local and regional scale distributions of tropical trees. Changes in soil moisture availability caused by global climate change and forest fragmentation are therefore likely to alter tropical species distributions community composition and diversity. 1474:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Organizing principles are needed to link organismal community and ecosystem attributes across spatial and temporal scales. Here we extend allometric theory how attributes of organisms change with variation in their size and test its predictions against worldwide data sets for forest communities by quantifying the relationships among tree size frequency distributions standing biomass species number and number of individuals per unit area. As predicted except for the highest latitudes the number of individuals scales as the 2 power of basal stem diameter or as the 3 4 power of above ground biomass. Also as predicted this scaling relationship varies little with species diversity total standing biomass latitude and geographic sampling area. A simulation model in which individuals allocate biomass to leaf stem and reproduction and compete for space and light obtains features identical to those of a community. In tandem with allometric theory our results indicate that many macroecological features of communities may emerge from a few allometric principles operating at the level of the individual. 14:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Flux densities of sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) were comparatively measured over a closed canopy of a cultivated paleotropical grass (Brachiaria decumbens) field and an open canopy of a native neotropical savanna with upright tiller grasses. The measurements were conducted during non rainy days of the wet season (May November). Results indicated that these two canopies differing in closure and forcing conditions were able to affect the energy budget. Consequently seasonally averaged daily net radiation (R n) was on average 1.1 fold higher over the Brachiaria canopy. However contrast in canopy closure had a major effect on the partitioning of seasonally averaged daily R n into LE H and soil heat flux (G) as seasonally averaged daily LE over the Brachiaria canopy dissipated 85 PeRcEnT of the available energy (7.5 0.6 MJ m( 2) day( 1)). Over the savanna the value was 64 PeRcEnT (4.9 0.3 MJ m( 2) day( 1)). Seasonally averaged daily measurements of H and G in the closed canopy were 53 and 66 PeRcEnT lower than those in the open canopy. In the Brachiaria canopy physical factors related to the hourly available energy were mainly controlling the energy partitioning and hourly LE was proportionally related to the equilibrium evaporation rate (LEeq). In the savanna canopy the canopy cover and relatively higher soil exposure to solar radiation (R s) were mainly controlling the stand evapotranspiration as the differential effect of R s and the air water saturation deficit on the vegetation and soil evaporating surfaces. The evapotranspirative adaptation of Brachiaria in relation to the dynamic between water transpirating and water absorbing surfaces as well as surface conductance sensitivity to soil transfer and yielding capacity are probably responsible for the widespread nature of this forage in the Orinoco Llanos. However the difference in production between the Brachiaria and savanna stands is economically determined under the limiting environmental conditions of the Orinoco Llanos where yield increases which may be gained throughout the agricultural inputs must justify the required addition of resources. 1513:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seedling dynamics play a crucial role in determining species distributions and coexistence. Exploring causes of variation in seedling dynamics can therefore provide key insights into the factors affecting these phenomena. We examined the relative importance of biotic neighborhood processes and habitat heterogeneity using survival data for 5 827 seedlings in 39 tree and shrub species over 2 years from an old growth temperate forest in northeastern China. We found significant negative density dependence effects on survival of tree seedlings and limited effects of habitat heterogeneity (edaphic and topographic variables) on survival of shrub seedlings. The importance of negative density dependence on young tree seedling survival was replaced by habitat in tree seedlings a parts per thousand yen4 years old. As expected negative density dependence was more apparent in gravity dispersed species compared to wind dispersed and animal dispersed species. Moreover we found that a community compensatory trend existed for trees. Therefore although negative density dependence was not as pervasive as in other forest communities it is an important mechanism for the maintenance of community diversity in this temperate forest. We conclude that both negative density dependence and habitat heterogeneity drive seedling survival but their relative importance varies with seedling age classes and species traits. 1515:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The landscape (matrix) surrounding habitat fragments critically affects the biodiversity of those fragments due to biotic interchange and physical effects. However to date there have been only a limited number of studies on plant animal interactions in fragmented landscapes particularly on how tree seedling herbivory is affected by fragmentation. We have examined this question in a fog dependent mosaic of rainforest fragments located on coastal mountaintops of semiarid Chile (30 degrees S) where the effects of the surrounding semiarid matrix and forest patch size (0.1 22 ha) on tree seedling survival were simultaneously addressed. The rainforest is strongly dominated by the endemic evergreen tree species Aextoxicon punctatum (Olivillo approx. 80 PeRcEnT of basal area). To assess the magnitudes and causes of Olivillo seedling mortality we set up a field experiment where 512 tree seedlings of known age were transplanted into four forest fragments of different sizes in four 1.5 x 3 m plots per patch; one half of each plot was fenced off with chicken wire to exclude small mammals. The plots were monitored for 22 months. Overall 50 PeRcEnT of the plants died during the experiment. The exclusion of small mammals from the plots increased seedling survival by 25 PeRcEnT with the effect being greater in smaller patches where matrix dwelling herbivores are more abundant. This experiment highlights the important role of the surrounding matrix in affecting the persistence of trees in forest fragments. Because herbivores from the matrix cause greater tree seedling mortality in small patches their effects must be taken into account in forest conservation restoration plans. 1517:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We developed an individual based stochastic empirical model to simulate the carbon dynamics of live and dead trees in a Central Amazon forest near Manaus Brazil. The model is based on analyses of extensive field studies carried out on permanent forest inventory plots and syntheses of published studies. New analyses included: ( 1) growth suppression of small trees ( 2) maximum size ( trunk base diameter) for 220 tree species ( 3) the relationship between growth rate and wood density and ( 4) the growth response of surviving trees to catastrophic mortality ( from logging). The model simulates a forest inventory plot and tracks recruitment growth and mortality of live trees decomposition of dead trees ( coarse litter) and how these processes vary with changing environmental conditions. Model predictions were tested against aggregated field data and also compared with independent measurements including maximum tree age and coarse litter standing stocks. Spatial analyses demonstrated that a plot size of similar to 10 ha was required to accurately measure wood ( live and dead) carbon balance. With the model accurately predicting relevant pools and fluxes a number of model experiments were performed to predict forest carbon balance response to perturbations including: ( 1) increased productivity due to CO2 fertilization ( 2) a single semi catastrophic ( 10 PeRcEnT) mortality event ( 3) increased recruitment and mortality ( turnover) rates and ( 4) the combined effects of increased turnover increased tree growth rates and decreased mean wood density of new recruits. Results demonstrated that carbon accumulation over the past few decades observed on tropical forest inventory plots (similar to 0.5 Mg C ha( 1) year( 1)) is not likely caused by CO2 fertilization. A maximum 25 PeRcEnT increase in woody tissue productivity with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 only resulted in an accumulation rate of 0.05 Mg C ha( 1) year( 1) for the period 1980 2020 for a Central Amazon forest or an order of magnitude less than observed on the inventory plots. In contrast model parameterization based on extensive data from a logging experiment demonstrated a rapid increase in tree growth following disturbance which could be misinterpreted as carbon sequestration if changes in coarse litter stocks were not considered. Combined results demonstrated that predictions of changes in forest carbon balance during the twenty first century are highly dependent on assumptions of tree response to various perturbations and underscores the importance of a close coupling of model and field investigations. 1547:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mast fruiting or masting behavior is the cumulative result of the reproductive patterns of individuals within a population and thus involves components of individual variability between individual synchrony and endogenous cycles of temporal autocorrelation. Extending prior work by Herrera we explore the interrelationships of these components using data on individual seed production in 59 populations of plants from 24 species spanning a large range of annual variability from species exhibiting strong masting to others with little annual variability in seed production. Estimates of population and individual variability were not biased by sample size or average overall seed production when based on untransformed seed production values but these values declined as log transformed seed production increased. Population variability was more strongly correlated with individual variability (r equals 0.86) than individual synchrony (r equals 0.73). These latter two components were also significantly correlated (r equals 0.45) but randomizations confirm that they need not covary closely. Thus selection can act separately on inter annual variability and between individual synchrony. We illustrate the potential for such fine tuned selection on seed production patterns by discussing several examples and by demonstrating significant differences in components of population level variation in seed production among species related to their life history. 1561:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tree mortality is an important process determining forest dynamics. However in species rich tropical forests it is largely unknown how species differ in their response of mortality to resource availability and individual condition. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability tree size and past growth on mortality of 284 woody species in a 50 ha long term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of vegetation density. Across the community 78 PeRcEnT of the species showed increasing mortality with increasing light. Considering species individually just 29 species showed a significant response to light all with increasing mortality at high light. Past growth had a significant impact on all but three species with higher growth leading to lower mortality. For the majority of species mortality decreased sharply with diameter in saplings then levelled off or increased slightly towards the maximum diameter of the species. Diameter had the biggest impact on mortality followed by past growth and finally light availability. Our results challenge many previous reports of higher mortality in shade and we suggest that it is crucial to control for size effects when assessing the impact of environmental conditions on mortality. 1565:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We compiled information from the international literature to quantify the relationships between seed mass and survival through each of the hazards plants face between seed production and maturity. We found that small seeded species were more abundant in the seed rain than large seeded species. However this numerical advantage was lost by seedling emergence. The disadvantage of small seeded species probably results from size selective post dispersal seed predation or the longer time small seeded species spend in the soil before germination. Seedlings from large seeded species have higher survival through a given amount of time as seedlings. However this advantage seems to be countered by the greater time taken for large seeded species to reach reproductive maturity: our data suggested no relationship or perhaps a weak negative relationship between seed size and survival from seedling emergence through to adulthood. A previous compilation showed that the inverse relationship between seed mass and the number of seeds produced per unit canopy area per year is countered by positive relationships between seed mass plant size and plant longevity. Taken together these data show that our old understanding of a species seed mass as the result of a trade off between producing a few large offspring each with high survival probability versus producing many small offspring each with a lower chance of successfully establishing was incomplete. It seems more likely that seed size evolves as part of a spectrum of life history traits including plant size plant longevity juvenile survival rate and time to reproduction. 1646:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Rates of change in tree communities following major disturbances are determined by a complex set of interactions between local site factors landscape history and structure regional species pools and species life histories. Our analysis focuses on vegetation change following abandonment of agricultural fields or pastures as this is the most extensive form of major disturbance in Neotropical forests. We consider five tree community attributes: stem density basal area species density species richness and species composition. We describe two case studies in northeastern Costa Rica and Chiapas Mexico where both chronosequence and annual tree dynamics studies are being applied. These case studies show that the rates of change in tree communities often deviate from chronosequence trends. With respect to tree species composition sites of different ages differ more than a single site followed over time through the same age range. Dynamic changes in basal area within stands on the other hand generally followed chronosequence trends. Basal area accumulation was more linked with tree growth rates than with net changes in tree density due to recruitment and mortality. Stem turnover rates were poor predictors of species turnover rates particularly at longer time intervals. Effects of the surrounding landscape on tree community dynamics within individual plots are poorly understood but are likely to be important determinants of species accumulation rates and relative abundance patterns. 1661:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In this study we examined the effects of water depth and temperature on seedling recruitment from a prairie wetland seed bank. We collected seed bank samples from natural and restored prairie pothole wetlands in northwestern Iowa and combined them into a single sample. We examined seedling recruitment from this seed bank sample in an experimental study using a factorial design of 4 temperature treatments (5 degrees night and 15 degrees day to 20 degrees night and 30 degrees day) and 3 water depth treatments (0 2 and 7 cm). Principal Components Analysis showed that both water depth and temperature had significant effects on the composition of the seedling community as measured by changes in relative stem density and biomass. Water depth had its strongest effects on stem density while temperature had its strongest effects on biomass. For the 22 most common species stem density varied with water depth for 95 PeRcEnT of the species and with temperature for 50 PeRcEnT of the species. Most species with water depth responses had lower stem counts as water depth increased and for the majority of species with temperature responses stem density increased with temperature. Total annual and perennial species richness was negatively correlated with water depth. Total and annual species richness was positively correlated to temperature while perennial species richness was unresponsive to temperature. In addition species found at low elevations as adults emerged at higher rates in the deep water treatments while species that occurred at higher elevations as adults had their highest emergence rates in the low water treatments. Our results suggest that differences in environmental conditions along coenoclines can affect the initial distribution of species emerging from the soil seed bank. Water depth sorted seedlings according to their adult water depth tolerances and temperature determined the proportion of annuals in the seedling community. 1663:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Niche differentiation with respect to habitat has been hypothesized to shape patterns of diversity and species distributions in plant communities. African forests have been reported to be relatively less diverse compared to highly diversed regions of the Amazonian or Southeast Asian forests and might be expected to have less niche differentiation. We examined patterns of structural and floristic differences among five topographically defined habitats for 494 species with stems a parts per thousand yen1 cm dbh in a 50 ha plot in Korup National Park Cameroon. In addition we tested for species habitat associations for 272 species (with more than 50 individuals in the plot) using Torus translation randomization tests. Tree density and basal area were lowest in areas with negative convexity which contained streams or were inundated during rainy periods and highest in moist well drained habitats. Species composition and diversity varied along the topographical gradient from low flat to ridge top habitats. The low depression and low flat habitats were characterized by high diversity and similar species composition relative to slopes high gullies and ridge tops. Sixty three percent of the species evaluated showed significant positive associations with at least one of the five habitat types. The majority of associations were with low depressions (75 species) and the fewest with ridge tops (8 species). The large number of species habitat associations and the pronounced contrast between low (valley) and elevated (ridgetop) habitats in the Korup plot shows that niche differentiation with respect to edaphic variables  soil moisture nutrients) contributes to local scale tree species distributions and to the maintenance of diversity in African forests. 1710:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tree survival plays a central role in forest ecosystems. Although many factors such as tree size abiotic and biotic neighborhoods have been proposed as being important in explaining patterns of tree survival their contributions are still subject to debate. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the relative importance of tree size local abiotic conditions and the density and identity of neighbors on tree survival in an old growth temperate forest in northeastern China at three levels (community guild and species). Tree size and both abiotic and biotic neighborhood variables influenced tree survival under current forest conditions but their relative importance varied dramatically within and among the community guild and species levels. Of the variables tested tree size was typically the most important predictor of tree survival followed by biotic and then abiotic variables. The effect of tree size on survival varied from strongly positive for small trees (1 20 cm dbh) and medium trees (20 40 cm dbh) to slightly negative for large trees ( 40 cm dbh). Among the biotic factors we found strong evidence for negative density and frequency dependence in this temperate forest as indicated by negative effects of both total basal area of neighbors and the frequency of conspecific neighbors. Among the abiotic factors tested soil nutrients tended to be more important in affecting tree survival than topographic variables. Abiotic factors generally influenced survival for species with relatively high abundance for individuals in smaller size classes and for shade tolerant species. Our study demonstrates that the relative importance of variables driving patterns of tree survival differs greatly among size classes species guilds and abundance classes in temperate forest which can further understanding of forest dynamics and offer important insights into forest management. 1754:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, New roads agricultural projects logging and mining are claiming an ever greater area of once pristine Amazonian forest. The Millennium Ecosystems Assessment (MA) forecasts the extinction of a large fraction of Amazonian tree species based on projected loss of forest cover over the next several decades. How accurate are these estimates of extinction rates? We use neutral theory to estimate the number relative abundance and range size of tree species in the Amazon metacommunity and estimate likely tree species extinctions under published optimistic and nonoptimistic Amazon scenarios. We estimate that the Brazilian portion of the Amazon Basin has (or had) 11 210 tree species that reach sizes   10 cm DBH (stem diameter at breast height). Of these 3 248 species have population sizes   1 million individuals and ignoring possible climate change effects almost all of these common species persist under both optimistic and nonoptimistic scenarios. At the rare end of the abundance spectrum however neutral theory predicts the existence of approximate to 5 308 species with   10 000 individuals each that are expected to suffer nearly a 50 PeRcEnT extinction rate under the nonoptimistic deforestation scenario and an approximate to 37 PeRcEnT loss rate even under the optimistic scenario. Most of these species have small range sizes and are highly vulnerable to local habitat loss. In ensembles of 100 stochastic simulations we found mean total extinction rates of 20 PeRcEnT and 33 PeRcEnT of tree species in the Brazilian Amazon under the optimistic and nonoptimistic scenarios respectively. 1767:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The allometric relationships for plant annualized biomass production (  growth  ) rates different measures of body size (dry weight and length) and photosynthetic biomass (or pigment concentration) per plant (or cell) are reported for multicellular and unicellular plants representing three algal phyla; aquatic ferns; aquatic and terrestrial herbaceous dicots; and arborescent monocots dicots and conifers. Annualized rates of growth G scale as the 3 4 power of body mass M over 20 orders of magnitude of M  G proportional to M 3 4); plant body length L  cell length or plant height) scales on average as the 1 4 power of M over 22 orders of magnitude of M  L proportional to: M 1 4); and photosynthetic biomass M p scales as the 3 4 power of nonphotosynthetic biomass M n  M p proportional to M n(3 4)). Because these scaling relationships are indifferent to phylogenetic affiliation and habitat they have far reaching ecological and evolutionary implications  net primary productivity is predicted to be largely insensitive to community species composition or geological age). 180:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We censused all trees   1 cm dbh in 50 ha of forest in Korup National Park southwest Cameroon in the central African coastal forest known for high diversity and endemism. The plot included 329 519 individuals and 493 species but 128 of those taxa remain partially identified. Abundance varied over four orders of magnitude from 1 individual per 50 ha (34 species) to Phyllobotryon spathulatum with 26 741 trees; basal area varied over six orders of magnitude. Abundance patterns both the percentage of rare species and the dominance of abundant species were similar to those from 50 ha plots censused the same way in Asia and Latin America. Rare species in the Korup plot were much less likely to be identified than common species: 42 PeRcEnT of taxa with   10 individuals in the plot were identified to species compared to 95 PeRcEnT of the abundant taxa. Geographic ranges for all identified species were gleaned from the literature and online flora. Thirteen of the plot species are known only from Korup National Park (all discovered during the plot census) and 39 are restricted to the Nigeria Cameroon coastal zone. Contrary to expectation species with narrow geographic ranges were more abundant in the plot than average. The small number of narrow endemics (11 PeRcEnT of the species) many locally abundant mitigates short term extinction risk either from demographic stochasticity or habitat loss. 1841:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, After leaves are clipped their reflectance properties change over time at variable rates. Spectral change can in part be attributed to the changing water content of the leaf which affects absorption in the VIS NIR and the SWIR. Maintaining water volume within samples has been the motivation behind many leaf handling techniques. This study has assessed the time constraints between leaf collection and spectral measurement. Specifically the relationship between leaf water content and foliar spectra (350 2500 nm) was examined over time for five tropical trees (common guava (Psidium guajava) purple guava (Psidium littorale) weeping fig (Ficus benjamina) floss silk (Chorisia speciosa) and coffee (Coffea arabica)). This investigation was carried for leaves wrapped with moist gauze around their petiole (treatment leaves) and leaves with no treatment. Spectral measurements and mass measurements were repeated for each leaf once every hour for the first 12 h then every 4 6 h for 18 h followed by one measurement after 12 h and finally once a day until the control samples became air dry. Foliar reflectance in the visible spectrum was not immediately responsive to water content changes and did not change until wilting of the leaf was observed. The NIR and SWIR wavelength regions were affected immediately by small changes in water content. Thus by the time wilting was first observed the NIR and SWIR foliar reflectance differed considerably from corresponding fresh leaf reflectance. No common time limit could be observed for leaf clipping and reflectance measurement. Leaves have a variety of water contents and dehydration rates hence measurement time constraints are dependent on the properties of the leaf or species. Rather than using a time limit it is recommended that leaf handling techniques be based upon managing leaf water content and leaf structure. The results of this study indicate that leaves with petioles wrapped in moist paper towel and placed within plastic bags will maintain leaf reflectance longer than equivalent leaves without treatment; samples tested here lasted a minimum of 7 days. theta and D indices (  angle difference   and   root mean square difference   respectively) revealed a stronger relationship between leaf water content and spectral shape than between leaf water and raw reflectance magnitude. The ratio of 1187 1096 nm when compared with theta and D indices and individual reflectance bands showed the highest coefficient of determination with leaf water content (r(2) 0.952). 1897:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, DIETSCH ET AL. AGREE WITH OUR GENERAL conclusions but argue that sun grown coffee should not be promoted and that coffee certification programs should address social and environmental problems. They argue in favor of conversion from sun to shade grown coffee. We believe that Dietsch . have generalized coffee conservation issues in Latin America to Asia and this has resulted in confusion. Although we agree that shadegrown coffee is the most appropriate form of environmentally friendly coffee agriculture the elevation climate and soil conditions are not appropriate in much of Sumatra. Shadegrown coffee is arabica coffee which does not grow well at low elevations and is thus not a viable option for Asian farmers living on the borders of lowland rainforest. We have argued that promoting shade grown coffee is insufficient to address conservation problems in Asia that forest conversion for coffee should stop and that coffee certification should recognize sun grown coffee produced in a manner that is organic and brings fair trade by providing a higher price to the farmers who cease their deforestation practices. Almost all coffee farms in Vietnam Indonesia or Papua New Guinea are small generally under 3 ha. In Lampung Province the average farmer plants just 1.9 ha of which 0.9 is planted with coffee; the remainder is divided among rice banana coconuts beans peppers corn and nontimber forest products. Of these only pepper is an export crop. The farmers already practice diversified agriculture but coffee and pepper provide the bulk of their cash income. We did consider the alternatives to coffee agriculture that might drive deforestation in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) including small scale logging ENSO related fires other agriculture and perverse incentives. We have completed an inspection of  100 locations in deforested areas and 67 PeRcEnT were planted with coffee. The scenario of distorted incentives that occurred in Vietnam did not occur around BBSNP. The World Bank has been very vocal in denying the accusation by OXFAM of involvement in coffee expansion in Vietnam and Dietsch . should clarify the reference to international development banks. We know of no international or national programs supporting land access (other than limited road construction) resources to clear forest or coffee production in Lampung Province. Although Nestle has a coffee processing plant in Lampung Province they provide no support for coffee agriculture. Dietsch . cite Evenson and Gollen to support the view that intensification of agriculture results in increased use of fertilizer and pesticides and may increase land area under cultivation. Evenson and Gollen however state that between 1981 and 2000 The area under food crop cultivation remained flat overall with declines in Latin America offsetting the continued expansion of agricultural lands in Sub Saharan Africa and the Middle East North Africa region. They argue that the use of new high yielding varieties slowed the rate of growth in inputs such as fertilizer and irrigation. Falling coffee yields in Indonesia are attributed to poor access to quality seed stock and neglect of groves. These production problems can be improved without resorting to chemicals. Removing coffee production from parks is not the only approach we advocate; it is the minimum action required. In areas of Asia where coffee agriculture is expanding alternatives are needed that protect parks improve the matrix surrounding protected areas and are appropriate for the local communities. Because converting to shade grown coffee is an inappropriate solution for lowland areas of Southeast Asia we believe that the greatest conservation benefits would be gained by actions that improve the value of sun grown robusta coffee through organic and fair trade certification. Although we recognize that there are problems with the implementation of certification of sun and shade grown coffee we believe that the carrot and stick approach of providing incentives to improve coffee agriculture discouraging the purchase of coffee grown inside protected areas and penalizing expansion through deforestation is worth pursuing. Otherwise current efforts to unify the coffee certification process will offer only a neotropical solution. 1902:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Grubb . suggest that the shape of the relation between seed mass and plant size is better explained by the mechanical constraints hypothesis than by a coordination of life history traits as suggested by Moles . Their preference for the mechanical constraints idea is largely based on the shape of the relation between seed mass and plant size. Grubb . used data from 226 species from an Australian rainforest to show that the slope of the lower boundary (5 PeRcEnT quantile) of the relation between seed mass and plant size was shallower than the slope of the upper boundary (95 PeRcEnT quantile). We believe that this is not sufficient evidence to exclude a Charnov like explanation for the relation between seed mass and plant size or to support the mechanical constraints hypothesis. Under the mechanical constraints hypothesis small plants should only be able to produce small seeds whereas large plants should be able to produce either large or small seeds. This hypothesis does provide a parsimonious explanation for the relationship presented by Grubb . in which the lower boundary (5 PeRcEnT quantile) has a slope that is not significantly different from zero. However examination of a larger data set E (data from reveals a general absence of large plants that produce very small seeds (despite the inclusion of four Ficus species) and a 5 PeRcEnT quantile line whose slope is significantly different from zero (P G 0.001; log log slope 0 0.63). Mechanical constraints could explain the upper boundary of this relation but cannot explain the absence of very large plants that produce very small seeds. Thus although mechanical constraints might contribute to the relation between seed mass and plant size it cannot be the sole process in operation. A theory based on coordination of life history traits provides one possible explanation for the absence of very large plants that produce very small seeds: Large offspring are necessary to offset the low survivorship to adulthood that would otherwise be a consequence of the longer juvenile periods associated with large adult size. Grubb . contend that the shape of the relation between maternal mass and offspring size is too different in plants and in animals to be explained by the same mechanism. It is true that the slope and R2 of this relation are much lower for plants than for animals but the general shape is similar. In the absence of a full mathematical theory about the shape of the relation for plants it is impossible to test whether a theory based on coordination of life history traits could explain both relations or even to determine whether the greater range of offspring masses displayed by taller plants is consistent or inconsistent with this theory. We still feel that an explanation based on coordination of life history traits provides a better fit to the empirical data than do alternatives. However further research will be needed if we are to quantify the relative importance of the different proposed mechanisms underlying the relation between plant size and seed size. 1919:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A general allometric model has been derived to predict intraspecific and interspecific scaling relationships among seed plant leaf stem and root biomass. Analysis of a large compendium of standing organ biomass sampled across a broad sampling of taxa inhabiting diverse ecological habitats supports the relations predicted by the model and defines the boundary conditions for above and below ground biomass partitioning. These canonical biomass relations are insensitive to phyletic affiliation (conifers versus angiosperms) and variation in averaged local environmental conditions. The model thus identifies and defines the limits that have guided the diversification of seed plant biomass allocation strategies. 1925:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Aragao and Shimabukuro (Reports 4 June 2010 p. 1275) reported that fires increase in agricultural frontiers even as deforestation decreases and concluded that these fires lead to unaccounted carbon emissions under the United Nations climate treatys tropical deforestation and forest degradation component. Emissions from post deforestation management activities are in fact included in these estimates but burning of standing forests is not. 196:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1973:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We derive a general model based on principles of biochemical kinetics and allometry that characterizes the effects of temperature and body mass on metabolic rate. The model fits metabolic rates of microbes ectotherms endotherms; (including those in hibernation) and plants in temperatures ranging from 0 degrees to 40 degrees C. Mass and temperature compensated resting metabolic rates of all organisms are similar: The lowest (for unicellular organisms and plants) is separated from the highest (for endothermic vertebrates) by a factor of about 20. Temperature and body size are primary determinants of biological time and ecological roles. 1979:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In science a relatively small pool of researchers garners a disproportionally large number of citations. Still very little is known about the social characteristics of highly cited scientists. This is unfortunate as these researchers wield a disproportional impact on their fields and the study of highly cited scientists can enhance our understanding of the conditions which foster highly cited work the systematic social inequalities which exist in science and scientific careers more generally. This study provides information on this understudied subject by examining the social characteristics and opinions of the 0.1 PeRcEnT most cited environmental scientists and ecologists. Overall the social characteristics of these researchers tend to reflect broader patterns of inequality in the global scientific community. However while the social characteristics of these researchers mirror those of other scientific elites in important ways they differ in others revealing findings which are both novel and surprising perhaps indicating multiple pathways to becoming highly cited. 1991:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although burial is known to have important effects on seed predation in a variety of habitats the role of burial depth in affecting the removal of seeds in early successional systems is poorly known. Phytolacca Americana (pokeweed) is a model species to examine the role of burial depth in affecting seed removal because it is common in early successional habitats studies suggest that seed removal is indicative of seed predation and seed predation is related to the recruitment of mature plants. To determine how burial depth affects P. americana seed removal 20 seeds of P. americana were buried at depths of 0 1 or 3 cm in early successional habitats at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina for over 6 weeks. The frequency with which seeds were encountered (as measured by the removal of at least one seed) and the proportion of seeds removed was significantly greater when seeds were on the soil surface (0 cm depth) compared to seeds that were buried I cm or 3 cm; there was no difference in encounter or removal between seeds at I cm or 3 cm. Our findings suggest that burial may have important consequences for P. americana population dynamics because seed survival depends upon whether or not the seed is buried and relatively shallow burial can yield large increases in seed survival. Because seed limitation is known to be an important determinant of plant community composition ill early successional systems our work suggests that burial may play an unappreciated role in the dynamics of these communities by reducing predator mediated seed limitation. 2063:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species invasions provide numerous unplanned and frequently but imperfectly replicated experiments that can be used to better understand the natural world. Classic studies by Darwin Grinnell Elton and others on these species invasion experiments provided invaluable insights for ecology and evolutionary biology. Recent studies of invasions have resulted in additional insights six of which we discuss here; these insights highlight the utility of using exotic species as model organisms. We also discuss a nascent hypothesis that might provide a more general predictive understanding of invasions and community assembly. Finally we emphasize how the study of invasions can help to inform our understanding of applied problems such as extinction ecosystem function and the response of species to climate change. 209:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Factors influencing the spatial distribution of two major species of non native plants blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and radiata pine (Pinus radiata) wildlings in a fragmented forest landscape in south eastern Australia were quantified. A total of 1067 plots within three broad groups of sites was surveyed for these two non native plant species. The sites were in large continuous areas of native eucalypt forest an extensive plantation of P. radiata and sites in patches of remnant eucalypt forest embedded within the pine plantation. In the case of the 507 plots located within patches of remnant eucalypt forest an array of variables  distance to surrounding pine plantation and floristic and structural attributes) was measured and used in statistical analyses of non native plant occurrence. P. radiata wildlings were totally absent from plots in large continuous areas of native eucalypt forest but present at 5 PeRcEnT of plots within patches of eucalypt remnants embedded within the pine plantation. Logistic regression showed that the occurrence of P. radiata wildlings in the eucalypt remnants was significantly higher in plots where the neighbouring pine plantation had been established for a long time plots that were dominated by dry eucalypt forest types and plots with a limited cover of ground vegetation. The occurrence of R. fruticosus differed significantly (P 0.001) between the groups of sites; 59 PeRcEnT of plots in the pine plantation 41 PeRcEnT in the eucalypt remnants and 7 PeRcEnT in continuous areas of native forest were invaded. For the eucalypt remnants the occurrence of this species was significantly greater in plots close to the surrounding pine plantation with fewer species of native shrubs in wet eucalypt forest types and with low values for both eucalypt basal area and rock cover. The results of this study indicate that even though non native plant invasion is already relatively extensive in the study area it is likely to further increase. The array of factors influencing the spread and establishment of P. radiata wildlings and R. fruticosus indicate that the control of these non native plants will be extremely difficult in the existing plantation estate. However the adoption of some simple protocols could make it feasible to limit their spread to newly established areas of the pine plantation estate. 20:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Here we review a general allometric model for the allometric relationships among standing leaf stem and root biomass (M L M S and M R respectively) and the exponents for the relationships among annual leaf stem and root biomass production or   growth rates   (G(L) G(S) and G(R) respectively). This model predicts that M L proportional to M S(3 4) proportional to M R(3 4) such that M S proportional to M R and that G(L) proportional to G(S) proportional to G(R). A large synoptic data set for standing plant organ biomass and organ biomass production spanning ten orders of magnitude in total plant body mass supports these predictions. Although the numerical values for the allometric   constants   governing these scaling relationships differ between angiosperms and conifers across all species standing leaf stem and root biomass respectively comprise 8 PeRcEnT 67 PeRcEnT and 25 PeRcEnT of total plant biomass whereas annual leaf stem and root biomass growth represent 30 PeRcEnT 57 PeRcEnT and 13 PeRcEnT of total plant growth. Importantly our analyses of large data sets confirm the existence of scaling exponents predicted by theory. These scaling   rules   emerge from simple biophysical mechanisms that hold across a remarkably broad spectrum of ecologically and phyletically divergent herbaceous and tree sized monocot dicot and conifer species As such they are likely to extend into evolutionary history when tracheophytes with the stereotypical   leaf      stem    and   root   body plan first appeared. 211:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,212:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Grevillea caleyi is an endangered plant species with a restricted range lying partly within Ku ring gai Chase and Garigal National Parks in NSW Australia. The principle threatening processes affecting G. caleyi are habitat destruction and adverse fire regimes combined with high levels of seed predation. A stochastic spatially explicit individual based model was constructed to investigate the population dynamics of small populations of the species and to determine the impact of a variety of management strategies. Results of model simulations indicate there is a high risk of population decline and local extinction in remnant sites with small populations under current management regimes. The most effective fire management strategy is to schedule fires that burn 20 100 PeRcEnT of sub populations every 5 15 years. in combination with reduced predation rates When predation management strategies are employed in conjunction with a structured fire regime then a 20 30 PeRcEnT reduction in predation rates can improve the chance of long term persistence substantially. 249:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,289:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A recent increase in published studies of lianas has been paralleled by a proliferation of protocols for censusing lianas. This article seeks to increase uniformity in liana inventories by providing specific recommendations for the determination of which taxa to include the location of diameter measurement points on individual stems the setting of minimum stem diameter cutoffs the treatment of multiple stemmed and rooted clonal groups and the measurement of noncylindrical stems. Use of more uniform liana censusing protocols may facilitate comparison of independently collected data sets and further our understanding of global patterns in liana abundance diversity biomass and dynamics. 291:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Variation in climate and soils results in inter site differences in the assemblages of tree life history strategies within a community which has important implications for ecosystem structure and dynamics. I investigated interspecific and inter site variation in wood specific gravity an easily measured indicator of tree life history strategy in four Neotropical forests and analyzed its correlates. Mean wood specific gravity (oven dry weight divided by fresh volume sometimes also referred to as wood density in the literature) differed significantly among sites varying inversely with soil fertility and independently of rainfall seasonality and temperature. Mean wood specific gravity values were much higher at Kilometer 41 Manaus Brazil where soils are extremely poor than at Cocha Cashu Peru Barro Colorado Island Panama or La Selva Costa Rica where soils are better and mortality rates of trees are higher. Within sites wood specific gravity varied widely among species. On Barro Colorado Island among species variation was significantly albeit weakly negatively correlated with sapling and tree mortality and relative growth rates. Altogether the results suggest that the distribution of tree life history strategies in a community varies substantially among sites with important consequences for community and ecosystem properties such as aboveground carbon stores. 292:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We test the hypotheses proposed by Gentry and Schnitzer that liana density and basal area in tropical forests vary negatively with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and positively with seasonality. Previous studies correlating liana abundance with these climatic variables have produced conflicting results warranting a new analysis of drivers of liana abundance based on a different dataset. We compiled a pan tropical dataset containing 28 953 lianas (  2.5 cm diam.) from studies conducted at 13 Neotropical and 11 Paleotropical dry to wet lowland tropical forests. The ranges in MAP and dry season length (DSL) (number of months with mean rainfall   100 mm) represented by these datasets were 860 7250 mm yr and 0 7 mo respectively. Pan tropically liana density and basal area decreased significantly with increasing annual rainfall and increased with increasing DSL supporting the hypotheses of Gentry and Schnitzer. Our results suggest that much of the variation in liana density and basal area in the tropics can be accounted for by the relatively simple metrics of MAP and DSL. 294:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This study examines the diets of four hornbill species (Bushy crested Hornbill Anorrhinus galeritus Wreathed Hornbill Aceros undulatus Rhinoceros Hornbill Buceros rhinoceros and Helmeted Hornbill Buceros vigil) common within our 9 km(2) study area in the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Sumatra Indonesia. Line transects and opportunistic sampling were used over one year to collect feeding data including the tree species and strata in which birds fed diet items fruit characteristics and tree crop size. Hornbills fed on 64 species. Figs non fig fruits and animals comprised 23.4 PeRcEnT (n equals 15 species) 51.6 PeRcEnT (n equals 33 species) and 25 PeRcEnT (n equals 16 species) of the diet respectively. Although there was overlap among the diets of the four species only B. rhinoceros and B. vigil had a statistically significant overlap primarily due to high fig consumption by both species. B. vigil fed almost exclusively on figs (98.6 PeRcEnT of the diet) and a small proportion of animals (1.4 PeRcEnT) while 23.1 PeRcEnT of the B. rhinoceros diet comprised non fig fruits and animals (23.1.PeRcEnT) with 76.9 PeRcEnT figs. A. galeritus and A. undulatus had distinct diets with drupaceous oily fruits comprising 66.7 PeRcEnT and 64.4 PeRcEnT of the diets respectively. We found no significant relationship between the numbers of hornbills visiting fruiting trees and the characteristics of the fruit (weight length and width). However maximum crop sizes of diet species significantly influenced the number of feeding hornbills. Hornbill species also differed in the strata in which they fed. A. galeritus and B. rhinoceros were seen in the middle of the canopy 56 PeRcEnT and 50.8 PeRcEnT of the time respectively while A. undulatus and B. vigil were observed more frequently in the upper canopy (50 PeRcEnT and 74 3 PeRcEnT of the time respectively). The lower part of the canopy was used infrequently by all species. This study suggests that the four hornbill species in our study partition food resources by food type and or feeding location. 296:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,307:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,316:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although avian frugivores are known to be important dispersers of seeds of pokeweed Phytolacca americana L. there are no studies that rigorously examine the effect of gut passage through avian frugivores on P. americana seeds. I examined how passage through avian frugivores affected the proportion of P. americana seeds germinating the rate of germination (average number of days required for all seeds to germinate) and the total number of viable seeds. Field collected fruits were either cleaned of pulp (control seeds) fed to northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos) or fed to Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum). The proportion of seeds germinating after passage through avian frugivores was greater than control seeds (0.88 vs. 0.67 respectively) but did not differ between Mockingbirds or Brown Thrashers. However seeds consumed by Mockingbirds germinated significantly faster on average (4.2 d) compared with seeds consumed by Brown Thrashers (4.6 d). Consumption by either species led to faster germination than control seeds (5.5 d). The total number of viable seeds did not differ among seeds consumed by avian frugivores or control seeds. These results suggest that avian frugivores do not change the viability of P. americana seeds. Rather avian frugivores shifted the timing of germination such that more seeds germinate more quickly after passage through frugivores. The adaptive implications of accelerated germination following passage through frugivores are briefly discussed. 32:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central goal of comparative life history theory is to derive the general rules governing growth metabolic allocation and biomass partitioning. Here we use allometric theory to predict the relationships among annual leaf stem and root growth rates (G(L) G(S) and G(R) respectively) across a broad spectrum of seed plant species. Our model predicts isometric scaling relationships among all three organ growth rates: G(L) proportional to G(S) proportional to G(R). It also provides a conceptual basis for understanding the differences in the absolute amounts of biomass allocated to construct the three organ types. Analyses of a large compendium of biomass production rates across diverse seed plant species provide strong statistical support for the predictions of the theory and indicate that reproductive investments may scale isometrically with respect to vegetative organ growth rates. The general rules governing biomass allocation as indexed by the scaling exponents for organ growth rates are remarkably indifferent to plant size and taxonomic affiliation. However the allometric   constants   for these relationships differ numerically as a function of phenotypic features and local environmental conditions. Nonetheless at the level of both inter and intraspecific comparisons the same proportional biomass allocation pattern holds across extant seed plant species. 351:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,351:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We investigated the effects of periodical cicadas (Magicicada spp.) on growth of their hosts using records of radial tree ring growth on oaks (Quercus spp. a common host genus) and pines (Pinus spp. a common nonhost genus) growing within the ranges of 13 and 17 year broods. Growth of oaks was significantly depressed during years of adult emergence by about 4 PeRcEnT. Effects in years following emergences or in years prior to emergences were variable or absent. Spectral analyses revealed a significant tendency for periodicity in the growth of oaks but not pines matching that of the life cycle of the broods. These results provide some of the first evidence for landscape level effects of a root feeding insect and demonstrate that periodical cicadas have a small but detectable effect on growth of their hosts on a geographical scale considerably larger than previously suspected. 365:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,415:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Studies have documented biodiversity losses due to intensification of coffee management (reduction in canopy richness and complexity). Nevertheless questions remain regarding relative sensitivity of different taxa habitat specialists and functional groups and whether implications for biodiversity conservation vary across regions. We quantitatively reviewed data from ant bird and tree biodiverstiy studies in coffee agroecosystes to address the following questions: Does species richness in coffee management individual vegetation characteristics? Are there significant losses of species richness in coffee management and Are ants or birds more strongly affected by intensification? Across studies ant and bird richness declined with management intensification and with changes in vegetation. Species richness of all ants and birds and of forest ant and bird species was lower in most coffee agroecosystems than in forests but rustic coffee (grown under native forest canopies) had equal or greater ant and bird richness than nearby forests. Sun coffee (grown without canopy trees) sustained the highest species losses and species loss of forest ant bird and tree species increased with management intensify. Losses of ant and bird species were similar although losses of forest ants were more drastic in rustic coffee. Richness of migratory birds and of birds that forage across vegetation strata was less affected by intensification than richness of resident canopy and understory bird species. Rustic farms protected more species than other coffee systems and loss of species depended greatly on habitat specialization and functional trails. We recommend that forest be protected rustic coffee be promoted and intensive coffee farms be restored by augmenting native tree density and richness and allowing growth of epiphytes. We also recommend that future research focus on potential trade offs between biodiversity conservation and farmer livelihoods stemming from coffee production. 430:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As a follow up to the observations of Charles Robertson from 1884 to 1916 we revisited the Carlinville Illinois area between 18 August 1970 and 13 September 1972 to sample and identify bee species (Hymenoptera: Apoidea). We concentrated on collecting nonparasitic bees (and excluded Apis and Bombus) visiting 24 plant species that bloomed at various times of the year and upon which Charles Robertson found many bee species. For example we collected most intensively on spring blooming Claytonia virginica and fall blooming Aster pilosus upon which Robertson reported 58 and 90 bee visitors respectively. Bees were also collected on an opportunistic basis at some other plants. We updated the species names used by Robertson for revisions and synonymies. This paper summarizes a comparison of the two collections made about 75 years apart at the same small geographic location. The study considers 214 valid bee species that Robertson collected plus an additional 14 species found by us but not by Robertson. Of these 214 we collected 140 species. The absence of most of the remaining 74 species that we did not collect can be explained by examining their plant preferences. Robertson did not record 47 of these 74 species on the 24 plant species where we collected intensively and he observed 19 more species on only one or two of the 24 plant species. Additionally he observed 21 of them on only one of the 441 plants he studied. Of the bee species found by Robertson on the 24 plant species we collected 82 PeRcEnT on the same plant species. The land uses and land cover on Macoupin Countys 225 464 ha. (558 080 acres) which bear directly on the type and availability of habitat for bees and their host plants varied considerably over two centuries. For example in the early 1800s land cover was about 73 PeRcEnT prairie and 27 PeRcEnT forest. The estimated 59 792 ha (148 000 acres) of forested land in 1820 diminished to 24 644 ha (61 000 acres) by 1924. It then grew to 34 340 ha (85 000 acres) by 1962. Agriculture is the predominant land use; in 1967 59 of the land was in harvested crops (primarily row crops) and 15 PeRcEnT was in pasture. Despite habitat changes and the passage of 75 years our 1970 and 1972 Carlinville collections show a high degree of similarity with those of Robertson possibly because diverse habitats within the agricultural matrix contained the host plants and nesting sites required by the bees. We recommend that a third survey of this area be undertaken as part of a long term study made possible by the meticulous 19th century records of Charles Robertson which must be preserved. 436:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Plant pollinator systems inherently possess wide variation that limits the applicability of surveys on population dynamics or diversity. Stable habitats are scarcely studied whereas dynamics in unprotected habitats are less predictable or more compromised by exotic organisms (Apis in the case of bee surveys). An extensively replicated long term study of orchid bees (Euglossini) was made in protected tropical moist forest in Panama. Over 47 000 bees were recorded in 124 monthly censuses employing 1952 counts. No aggregate trend in abundance occurred (from 1979 to 2000) although four individual species declined nine increased 23 showed no change and species richness was stable. No rare or parasitic species showed decreasing trends while the most common of the set of bee species studied gradually declined. Biodiversity therefore increased. Recorded variability included 300 PeRcEnT (fourfold) differences in bee abundance among years and changes in species abundance up to 14 fold. Surveys in dry and wet seasons (N equals 17 and 18 years 29 and 31 species respectively) indicated no numerical changes in the bee assemblage over 21 years. El Ni (n) over o climatic events led to brief increases in bee abundance. This detailed survey is deconstructed to assess sampling rigor and strategies particularly considering the recorded local differences within a single forest. Year to year shifts in bee abundance for three tropical and five temperate bee censuses were comparable. In short studies (2 4 years) and during longer studies (17 21 years) 59 species that included solitary social and highly social bees had mean abundances that varied by factors of 2.06 for temperate bees and 2.16 for tropical bees.   Normal   bee populations commonly halved or doubled in 1 yr intervals. Longer term data are only available for the tropics. Stochastic variation and limitations of monitoring methods suggest that minimum series of four years  three intervals) of several counts during the active season may demonstrate genuine trends. Longer term continuous studies are still needed for meaningful insights on pollinator population shifts in nature. 499:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,508:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, As interest grows in quantification of global carbon cycles process model predictions of forest biomass and net primary production (NPP) are being developed at an accelerating rate. Such models can provide useful predictions at large scales but it has been difficult to evaluate their performance. Using the network of plots comprising the comprehensive and spatially extensive Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data set collected and maintained by the USDA Forest Service we applied methods typically used in field measurements to develop estimates of forest biomass and NPP for the mid Atlantic region of the United States at a scale appropriate for comparison with model predictions. Plot level and tree level forest inventory data from a subset of plots were used together with species specific biomass regression equations to calculate maximum current biomass and NPP values for the mid Atlantic region. Estimates at the plot level were aggregated by forest type and to the 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees scale for analysis and comparison with process model predictions. Maximum current forest biomass averaged 248 and 200 Mg.ha( 1).yr(1) in hardwood and softwood forest types respectively; wood biomass increment averaged 559 and 460 g.m( 2) yr( 1) in hardwood and softwood forest types respectively. Aggregated to the 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees scale forest biomass ranged from 101 to 326 Mg ha while wood biomass increment ranged from 254 to 1050 g.m( 2).yr( 1). Biomass and NPP estimates for closed canopy forests from this study were consistent with values reported in the literature but were as much as 50 PeRcEnT lower than values reported for old growth stands. NPP predictions from three process models were fairly consistent with the FIA based estimates but model predictions of biomass were higher than estimates from FIA data for the region. By describing upper and lower bounds on reasonable biomass and NPP values for closed canopy forests these FIA derived estimates provide a foundation for model comparison and continued model development. 516:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Corridors that connect disjunct populations are heavily debated in conservation largely because the effects of corridors have rarely been evaluated by replicated large scale studies. Using large scale experimental landscapes we found that in addition to documented positive effects corridors also have negative impacts on bird dispersed plants by affecting seed predation and that overall predation is a function of the seeds primary consumer (rodents or arthropods). Both large seeded Prunus serotina and small seeded Rubus allegheniensis experienced greater predation in connected patches. However P. serotina experienced significantly less seed predation compared to R. allegheniensis in unconnected patches due to decreased impacts of rodent seed predators on this large seeded species. Viewed in light of previous evidence that corridors have beneficial impacts by increasing pollination and seed dispersal this work demonstrates that corridors may have both positive and negative effects for the same plant species at different life stages. Moreover these effects may differentially affect plant species within the same community: seeds primarily consumed by rodents suffer less predation in unconnected patches. By shifting the impact of rodent and arthropod seed predators corridors constructed for plant conservation could lead to shifts in the seed bank. 525:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Evaluations of the ecological consequences of environmental accidents can benefit from a long term perspective. To assess the effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill on habitat use and occupancy during midsummer by marine oriented birds over a 12 yr period following the spill in 1989 we conducted surveys in 10 study bays in Prince William Sound Alaska USA. These bays varied from completely unoiled to some of the most heavily oiled locations in the spill zone. We used oiling as a quantitative variable with and without habitat measures as covariates to assess spill effects and their changes over time. We also used oiling as a categorical variable (  oiled   vs.   unoiled   bays) to conduct between year repeated measures analyses that used 1984 data as a baseline and to plot abundance trends by oiling category. We combined the results of these analyses in a   weight of evidence   approach to determine overall impacts and recovery for each species. To assess changes in habitat condition following the oil spill we also measured several habitat features in 1991 1998 and 2001. There were significant increases in the proportion of shoreline covered by rockweed (Fucus) and mussels in oiled bays between 1991 and 1998 2001 suggesting recovery of oiled habitats. Of the 25 bird species whose status we evaluated 12 (48 PeRcEnT) exhibited no evidence of any spill impacts 10 (40 PeRcEnT) exhibited negative impacts that subsequently disappeared and three (12 PeRcEnT) exhibited positive relationships with oiling that later disappeared. No species provided clear evidence of any delayed impacts. In comparison with our earlier analysis of a more extensive data set collected from these same study bays during 1989 1991 we detected slightly more initial spill impacts in the present study but also found that several species whose habitat occupancy had not recovered by the end of our earlier study had now recovered. Our conclusions differ from those of some other studies of the effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill on birds perhaps because of differences in study design in the criteria used to assess impact and recovery and in the definition of   recovery.   These differences illustrate the difficulties of evaluating the consequences of environmental accidents even in such a dramatic and well studied situation as the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Long term studies of environmental accidents create a paradox: the long term perspective is needed to see how impact and recovery dynamics are played out yet background natural variation can make it increasingly difficult to detect clear patterns. With the passage of time after an environmental accident more things happen making it more difficult to attribute observed patterns to the event alone. Consequently long term assessments of ecological impacts may be restricted to documenting only large effects; the use of a levels greater than the traditional 0.05 can facilitate such analyses and reduce the likelihood of committing type II errors. 53:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,591:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,617:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In plants that produce seeds with contrasting genetic background (selfed versus outcrossed) the question arises whether the ecological function of the two types of progeny differ. This paper addresses this issue for the ant dispersed Calathea micans by introducing a novel application of the Neubert Caswell model for analysis of wave speed for structured populations. Because dispersal as well as vital rates are structured the model allows for distinct dispersal kernels for different types of progeny and thus permits comparisons of the sensitivity to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters of in situ population growth rate versus population spread across space. The study site was a lowland evergreen tropical rain forest at La Selva Biological station Costa Rica where the species is commonly found throughout the forest. In C. inicans seeds produced by open flowers (potentially outcrossed) or by closed flowers (selfed) bear oily arils and are dispersed by ants. Five life history stages were used to characterize the population: seedlings originating from seeds produced by open flowers seedlings originating from seeds produced by closed flowers juvenile vegetative plants reproductive plants without new shoots and reproductive plants with new shoots. Demography varied seasonally. Transitions were estimated from marking and following the fate of plants (N equals 400) in a natural population over a dry and a wet season. The population dynamics was described by a 10 x 10 matrix with five life history stages and two habitat states. The habitat states cycle repeatedly dry wet dry wet. To estimate dispersal kernels for each seed type individual seeds (N 225 and 306 seeds produced by open and closed flowers respectively) were color coded and placed in depots allowing the ants to redistribute them. Five months later seedlings with an attached seed coat bearing the intact color coding were surveyed around the depots. Radial distances and angles were recorded for each seedling (N 67 and 81 seedlings arising from open and closed flowers respectively). The results of the model give an asymptotic growth rate of 1.06 per season and an asymptotic rate of spread of 8.36 cm per season. There is a high correlation (r 0.99) between elasticity of growth rate and elasticity of rate of spread of the population. Both rates are most sensitive to changes in stasis of juveniles during the dry season. However most interesting is the analysis that revealed that population spread is more sensitive than in situ population growth to demographic rates of seedlings arising from open flowers. The analysis suggests a new way of thinking about ecological functions of multiple modes of reproduction. 641:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) is a collaborative multisite experiment using a common temperature manipulation to examine variability in species response across climatic and geographic gradients of tundra ecosystems. ITEX was designed specifically to examine variability in arctic and alpine species response to increased temperature. We compiled from one to four years of experimental data from 13 different ITEX sites and used meta analysis to analyze responses of plant phenology growth and reproduction to experimental warming. Results indicate that key phenological events such as leaf bud burst and flowering occurred earlier in warmed plots throughout the study period; however there was little impact on growth cessation at the end of the season. Quantitative measures of vegetative growth were greatest in warmed plots in the early years of the experiment whereas reproductive effort and success increased in later years. A shift away from vegetative growth and toward reproductive effort and success in the fourth treatment year suggests a shift from the initial response to a secondary response. The change in vegetative response may be due to depletion of stored plant reserves whereas the lag in reproductive response may be due to the formation of flower buds one to several seasons prior to flowering. Both vegetative and reproductive responses varied among life forms; herbaceous forms had stronger and more consistent vegetative growth responses than did woody forms. The greater responsiveness of the herbaceous forms may be attributed to their more flexible morphology and to their relatively greater proportion of stored plant reserves. Finally warmer low arctic sites produced the strongest growth responses but colder sites produced a greater reproductive response. Greater resource investment in vegetative growth may be a conservative strategy in the Low Arctic where there is more competition for light nutrients or water and there may be little opportunity for successful germination or seedling development. In contrast in the High Arctic heavy investment in producing seed under a higher temperature scenario may provide an opportunity for species to colonize patches of unvegetated ground. The observed differential response to warming suggests that the primary forces driving the response vary across climatic zones functional groups and through time. 652:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume specific leaf area wood density and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests. There was a tendency for a trade off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density seed volume and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was surprisingly only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival. Single traits accounted for 9 55 PeRcEnT of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination the morphological traits explained 41 PeRcEnT of the variation in growth rate and 54 PeRcEnT of the variation in mortality rate with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions. 660:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,663:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,666:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An economy of scale may lead to selection to increase interannual variation in seed production when the per seed probability of seedling establishment. increases with seed production. Variable annual seedfall will however reduce this probability when post dispersal seed fate is negatively density dependent on the local density of seeds and seed dispersal and density dependence act identically across years. Intuitively more variable annual seedfall causes the representative seed to experience a greater density of conspecific seeds and suffer greater density dependent effects. This handicap must be overcome for the per seed probability of recruitment to be greater in years with greater seed production. We quantified spatial and annual variation in seedfall and seedling recruitment evaluated density dependence and economies of scale during the seed to seedling transition and investigated the synergistic consequences of density dependence and variable annual seedfall for seedling recruitment on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) Panama. Weekly censuses of 200 0.5 m(2) seed traps documented seedfall for 15 years and 108 plant species. Annual censuses of 600 1 m(2) seedling plots documented recruitment for nine years and 32 species. The density of seedling recruits tended to increase with the density of seeds; however the per seed probability of recruitment invariably decreased with seedfall density. Negative density dependence characterized the seed to seedling transition. Observed levels of spatial and interannual variation in seedfall density would reduce long term recruitment by up to 28 PeRcEnT if negatively density dependent survival acted identically across years; however the strength of negative density dependence varied significantly among years for 12 of 32 species. Negative density dependence occurred in all years for these species but was significantly weaker during the one or two years of greatest seedfall than during the remaining years of lower seedfall. The per seed probability of recruitment increased significantly with annual seedfall for eight of these species. These eight species realized postdispersal economies of scale despite the reduction in long term recruitment expected from the synergism between variable annual seed production and negatively density dependent seed fate. 704:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In closed canopy forests plant morphology and physiology determine shade tolerance and potential growth and mortality rates; potential vital rates and ongoing gap dependence determine realized vital rates; and realized vital rates determine individual size distributions. This hypothesis was evaluated for the 73 most abundant canopy tree species from Barro Colorado Island Panama. The percentage of recruits located in tree fall gaps (P) sapling growth (G) and mortality (M) rates and the coefficient of skewness of size distributions (g(1)) were determined from censuses of all individuals  10 mm dbh in a 50 ha plot Seven qualitative bivariate predictions relating g(1) G M P and wood density (W) were evaluated. Six of the seven predictions were substantiated in pairwise analyses. A path analysis integrated all seven predictions and explained 51 PeRcEnT of the interspecific variation in g . Size distributions with many large individuals and a long tail of relatively rare small individuals (g(1)   0) characterized gap dependent species with large fecundity seed mortality seedling mortality G M and P. Size distributions with many small individuals and a long tail of relatively rare large individuals (g(1)   0) characterized shade tolerant species with the opposite traits. The percentage of tropical tree species that require tree fall gaps to regenerate has been estimated to range from  20 PeRcEnT to  70 PeRcEnT for old growth forests. Our analyses suggest that there are not large numbers of functionally equivalent species at either extreme of the regeneration continuum. Rather there are very few extremely shade tolerant and extremely light demanding species. Most species have intermediate light requirements and lifestyles. 729:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Phylogenetic ecology has identified patterns of diversity in communities that may find explanation in trophic interactions and yet there have been few attempts to directly relate such patterns among trophic levels. Density dependent processes involving pests and pathogens for example have been invoked to account for plant community phylogenetic patterns but relatively little is known about how plant relatedness might affect community structure at other trophic levels. We examined the degree to which the abundance of herbivores in a rain forest community is explained by the phylogeny and functional traits of host plants. We destructively sampled all stems   5 cm diameter in two 1 ha plots of New Guinea primary and secondary lowland forest to test predicted relationships between herbivore abundance and plant resources. We analyzed per tree caterpillar and leaf miner abundance total leaf biomass (kg) percentage of immature foliage specific leaf area (cm(2) g) leaf nitrogen content (percentage of dry mass) and presence of exudates in the context of a plant community phylogeny estimated from DNA barcodes. Apart from nitrogen content and exudates neither plant resources nor herbivore abundance showed evidence of phylogenetic signal in our community sample. The plant traits we measured could account for only 30 PeRcEnT and 16 PeRcEnT of variation in caterpillar and leaf miner abundance respectively among individual trees. Leaf biomass was a stronger predictor of herbivore abundance than either resource quality (leaf nitrogen content) or palatability (percentage of immature foliage specific leaf area). The primary importance of resource quantity was also observed at the plant species level in analyses of species means and phylogenetic generalized least squares regression. Plant relatedness did not account for much variation in herbivore abundance but significant effects of exudates and leaf nitrogen content on caterpillar abundance illustrate how conserved traits at one trophic level may influence community wide patterns at another. 778:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To gain insight into the ecological processes driving community reassembly in disturbed ecosystems we assessed the phylogenetic dispersion of early and late successional tree species occurring in lowland forests of northeastern Costa Rica. Early successional species were more closely related than expected by chance whereas late successional species tended to be less closely related than expected by chance. Then we evaluated temporal changes in the phylogenetic structure of seedling and tree assemblages in four 1 ha plots of secondary forests in this region. We found an increase in the phylogenetic evenness among tree individuals over time in all secondary tree assemblages indicating that relatedness among tree individuals decreases as succession unfolds. This pattern was jointly promoted by recruitment and mortality processes suggesting that increasing evenness was caused by the replacement of individuals of early successional species from closely related lineages by late successional species belonging to a wider diversity of lineages. Based on species occurrence however tree community reassembly did not show any significant phylogenetic trend over time. These results suggest that shifts in species abundance over succession have a greater impact on the phylogenetic structure of the community than the turnover of species. Seedling assemblages showed higher phylogenetic evenness than tree assemblages suggesting that propagule colonization is an important process driving phylogenetic changes in species composition throughout succession. Overall our findings showed that the phylogenetic structure of these successional communities varies at two temporal scales. At short timescales decreased dominance by early successional species over succession leads to increased evenness among tree individuals. At longer timescales colonization processes result in increased phylogenetic evenness in seedling communities compared to tree communities forecasting increasing phylogenetic evenness among adult individuals at late successional stages. 77:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the annual migration of the Serengeti wildebeest but few studies have compared distribution patterns with environmental drivers. We used a rainfall driven model of grass dynamics and wildebeest movement to generate simulated monthly wildebeest distributions with wildebeest movement decisions depending on 14 candidate models of adaptive movement in response to resource availability. We used information theoretic approaches to compare the fits of simulated and observed monthly distribution patterns at two spatial scales over a 3 year period. Models that included the intake rate and nitrogen (N) concentration of green grass and the suppressive effect of tree cover on grass biomass provided the best model fits at both spatial scales tested suggesting that digestive constraints and protein requirements may play key roles in driving migratory behavior. The emergence of a migration was predicted to be dependent on the ability of the wildebeest to track changes in resource abundance at relatively large scales (180 100 km). When movement decisions are based solely on local resource availability the wildebeest fail to migrate across the ecosystem. Our study highlights the potentially key role of strong and countervailing seasonally driven rainfall and fertility gradients a consistent feature of African savanna ecosystems as drivers of long distance seasonal migrations in ungulates. 783:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tropical plant diversity is extraordinarily high at both local and regional scales. Many studies have demonstrated that natural enemies maintain local diversity via negative density dependence but we know little about how natural enemies influence beta diversity across habitats and or regions. One way herbivores could influence plant beta diversity is by driving allocation trade offs that promote habitat specialization across resource gradients. We therefore predicted that increasing resource availability should be accompanied by increasing herbivory rates and decreasing plant allocation to defense. Second relative abundances within plant lineages are predicted to reflect patterns of habitat specialization and allocation trade offs. A phylogenetic context is vital not only to compare homologous plant traits (including defense strategies) across habitat types but also to connect evolutionary trade offs to patterns of species diversification in each phylogenetic lineage. We tested these predictions for trees in white sand clay terra firme and seasonally flooded forests in Peru and French Guiana that represent the range of soil fertility forest structure and floristic compositions found throughout the Amazon region. We established 74 0.5 ha plots in these habitats and sampled all trees. Within 12 representative plots we marked newly expanding leaves of 394 saplings representing 68 species including the most abundant species in each plot in addition to species from five focal lineages: Swartzia and Inga (Fabaceae) Protieae (Burseracaeae) Bombacoideae (Malvaceae) and Micropholis (Sapotaceae). We measured total leaf production rates for each sapling and calculated relative herbivory impact as the ratio between herbivory rate and leaf production rate. Herbivory rates averaged 2.1 PeRcEnT per month did not correlate with leaf production rate and were similar across habitats. Relative herbivore impacts exceeded leaf production rates for most species. Leaf production rate averaged 2.8 PeRcEnT was significantly higher in seasonally flooded forests than the other two habitats and exhibited significant correlations with specific leaf area. Species with high herbivory rates exhibited significantly lower relative abundances in terra firme forests. Overall focal species within lineages present contrasting patterns regarding their herbivory rates and leaf production rate within habitats. These results highlight why a lineage based approach is necessary when attempting to connect hypotheses regarding evolutionary trade offs to community assembly patterns. 795:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We quantified seed dispersal in a guild of Sonoran Desert winter desert annuals at a protected natural field site in Tucson Arizona USA. Seed production was suppressed under shrub canopies in the open areas between shrubs or both by applying an herbicide prior to seed set in large randomly assigned removal plots (10 30 m diameter). Seedlings were censused along transects crossing the reproductive suppression borders shortly after germination. Dispersal kernels were estimated for Pectocarya recurvata and Schismus barbatus from the change in seedling densities with distance from these borders via inverse modeling. Estimated dispersal distances were short with most seeds traveling less than a meter. The adhesive seeds of P. recurvata went farther than the small S. barbatus seeds which have no obvious dispersal adaptation. Seeds dispersed farther downslope than upslope and farther when dispersing into open areas than when dispersing into shrubs. Dispersal distances were short relative to the pattern of spatial heterogeneity created by the shrub and open space mosaic. This suggests that dispersal could contribute to local population buildup possibly facilitating species coexistence. Overall these results support the hypothesis that escape in time via delayed germination is likely to be more important for desert annuals than escape in space. 797:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We used 37 years of North American Breeding Bird Surveys to test for effects of periodical cicada (Magicicada spp.) emergences on the abundance and spatial synchrony of 24 species of avian predators in hardwood forests of the eastern United States. Fifteen (63 PeRcEnT) of the bird species exhibited numerical changes in abundance apparently associated with emergences of the local periodical cicada brood and intraspecific spatial synchrony of bird abundance was significantly greater between populations sharing the same cicada brood than between populations in the ranges of different broods. Species exhibited at least four partially overlapping temporal patterns. (I) Cuckoos (Coccyzus spp.) occurred in high numbers only during emergence years and subsequently declined in abundance. (2) Red bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata) Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) and Brown headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased significantly 1 3 years following emergences and then declined. (3) Red headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) American Crows (Corvus brachyrynchos) Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus bicolor) Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum) were found in significantly low numbers during emergence years underwent significant numerical increases in the following year and then stabilized. (4) Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) Northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos) Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) exhibited significantly deviant population numbers 1 2 years prior to emergences below the long term mean in the first two species and above the long term mean in the latter two. These results suggest that the pulses of resources available at 13 or 17 year intervals when periodical cicadas emerge have significant demographic effects on key avian predators mostly during or immediately after emergences but in some cases apparently years following emergence events. 7:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examined seed survival in exotic and native dominated grasslands by placing seeds of a once pervasive native grass species Nassella pulchra and two of the most common widespread exotic grass species Avena fatua and Bromus hordeaceus in mesh bags in the field for 3 months. Compared to germination of unexposed seeds not placed in the field exotic species experienced an approximately 40 PeRcEnT reduction in viability whereas the mortality experienced by the native species was   20 PeRcEnT. Despite these differences germination rates of exposed seeds were similar between native and exotic species because native N. pulchra seeds had lower initial viability prior to entering the seed bank. Seed mortality did not differ based on whether seeds were placed in habitats dominated by exotic or native grasses. Rather our results suggest that re establishment of native N. pulchra must focus on maximizing seed viability and survival and that A. fatua and B. hordeaceus overcome relatively higher losses of viable seeds in the seed bank potentially by producing large numbers of highly viable seeds. sson SAS.  847:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Major shifts in many ecosystem level properties of tropical forests have been observed but the processes driving these changes are poorly understood. The forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) exhibited a 20 PeRcEnT decrease in the number of trees and a 10 PeRcEnT increase in average diameter. Using a metabolism based zero sum framework we show that increases in per capita resource use at BCI caused by increased tree size and increased temperature compensated for the observed declines in abundance. This trade off between abundance and average resource use resulted in no net change in the rate resources are fluxed by the forest. Observed changes in the forest are not consistent with other hypotheses including changes in overall resource availability and existing self thinning models. The framework successfully predicts interrelated changes in size abundance and temperature indicating its utility for understanding changes in the structure and dynamics of ecosystems. 897:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The mean size of seeds produced by plants at the equator is two to three orders of magnitude higher than the mean size of seeds produced by plants at 60 degrees. We compiled data from the literature to assess the possibility that this latitudinal gradient in seed size allows species to cope with more difficult seedling establishment conditions in tropical environments. We found no relationship between latitude and seedling survival through 1 week (P equals 0.27 n equals 112 species). There was also no evidence that a larger seed mass is required to gain a given level of seedling survival in tropical environments (P equals 0.37 n equals 112 species) and no relationship between latitude and the duration of the juvenile period (P equals 0.57 n equals 132 species). Thus our results are not compatible with the idea that seedling establishment is more difficult in the tropics. 904:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The theory of metabolic ecology predicts specific relationships among tree stem diameter biomass height growth and mortality. As demographic rates are important to estimates of carbon fluxes in forests this theory might offer important insights into the global carbon budget and deserves careful assessment. We assembled data from 10 old growth tropical forests encompassing censuses of 367 ha and   1.7 million trees to test the theorys predictions. We also developed a set of alternative predictions that retained some assumptions of metabolic ecology while also considering how availability of a key limiting resource light changes with tree size. Our results show that there are no universal scaling relationships of growth or mortality with size among trees in tropical forests. Observed patterns were consistent with our alternative model in the one site where we had the data necessary to evaluate it and were inconsistent with the predictions of metabolic ecology in all forests. 905:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The two factors that determine plant migration rates seed dispersal and population growth are generally treated independently despite the fact that many animals simultaneously enhance plant migration rate via seed dispersal and decrease it via negative effects of herbivory on population growth. Using extensive empirical data we modelled the antagonistic effects of seed dispersal and herbivory by white tailed deer on potential migration rates of Trillium grandiflorum a forest herb in eastern North America. This novel antagonistic interaction is illustrated by maximum migration rates occurring at intermediate but low herbivory (  15 PeRcEnT). Assuming herbivory   20 PeRcEnT and favourable conditions for population growth during post glacial migration seed dispersal by deer can explain rates of migration achieved in the past in contrast to previous models of forest herb migration. However relatively unfavourable conditions for population growth and increasingly intense herbivory by deer may compromise plant migration in the face of present and future climate change. 912:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tropical forests vary substantially in the densities of trees of different sizes and thus in above ground biomass and carbon stores. However these tree size distributions show fundamental similarities suggestive of underlying general principles. The theory of metabolic ecology predicts that tree abundances will scale as the 2 power of diameter. Demographic equilibrium theory explains tree abundances in terms of the scaling of growth and mortality. We use demographic equilibrium theory to derive analytic predictions for tree size distributions corresponding to different growth and mortality functions. We test both sets of predictions using data from 14 large scale tropical forest plots encompassing censuses of 473 ha and   2 million trees. The data are uniformly inconsistent with the predictions of metabolic ecology. In most forests size distributions are much closer to the predictions of demographic equilibrium and thus intersite variation in size distributions is explained partly by intersite variation in growth and mortality. 962:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sudden Oak Death (Phytophthora ramorum) is a non indigenous forest pathogen which causes substantial mortality of coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and several other oak tree species on the Pacific Coast of the United States. We estimated the time path of residential property values subject to oak mortality using a dataset that spans more than two decades including a decade of transactions before and after the invasion. The findings suggest moderate persistent property value discounts (3 6 PeRcEnT) for homes located near infested oak woodlands subject to continuous post invasion declines in forest health. The most severe discounts (8 15 PeRcEnT) occurred where dying oaks were distributed both within residential neighborhoods and in nearby woodlands. Various hedonic modeling specifications were tested and compared to assess their ability to control for bias associated with unobserved spatial effects. 965:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite scientific concern about Amazon deforestation and the impacts of the Amazon gold rush few researchers have assessed the long term impacts of small scale gold mining on forest cover. This study estimates deforestation from gold mining and analyses the regeneration of abandoned mining areas in the Suriname Amazon. Fieldwork in December 1998 included observations and ecological measurements as well as qualitative interviews with local miners about mining history and technology. Vegetation cover of abandoned mining sites of different ages was compared with that in old growth forest. By present estimates gold miners clear 48 96 km(2) of old growth forest in Suriname annually. Based on different assumptions about changes in technology and the amount of mining that takes place on previously mined sites cumulative deforestation is expected to reach 750 2280 km(2) by 2010. Furthermore the analysis of abandoned mining sites suggests that forest recovery following mining is slow and qualitatively inferior compared to regeneration following other land uses. Unlike areas in nearby old growth forest large parts of mined areas remain bare ground grass and standing water. The area deforested by mining may seem relatively small but given the slow forest recovery and the concentration of mining in selected areas small scale gold mining is. expected to reduce local forest cover and ecosystem services in regions where mining takes place. 100:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,102:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To predict the spread of invasive species we need to understand the mechanisms that underlie their range expansion. Assuming random diffusion through homogeneous environments invasions are expected to progress at a constant rate. However environmental heterogeneity is expected to alter diffusion rates especially by slowing invasions as populations encounter suboptimal environmental conditions. Here we examine how environmental and landscape factors affect the local invasion speeds of cane toads (Chaunus Bufo marinus) in Australia. Using high resolution cane toad data we demonstrate heterogeneous regional invasion dynamics that include both decelerating and accelerating range expansions. Toad invasion speed increased in regions characterized by high temperatures heterogeneous topography low elevations dense road networks and high patch connectivity. Regional increases in the toad invasion rate might be caused by environmental conditions that facilitate toad reproduction and movement by the evolution of long distance dispersal ability or by some combination of these factors. In any case theoretical predictions that neglect environmental influences on dispersal at multiple spatial scales may prove to be inaccurate. Early predictions of cane toad range expansion rates that assumed constant diffusion across homogeneous landscapes already have been proved wrong. Future attempts to predict range dynamics for invasive species should consider heterogeneity in (1) the environmental factors that determine dispersal rates and (2) the mobility of invasive populations because dispersal relevant traits can evolve in exotic habitats. As an invasive species spreads it is likely to encounter conditions that influence dispersal rates via one or both of these mechanisms. 1035:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Wood packaging material (WPM) is a significant pathway by which bark and wood boring insects move between countries. Recognising this threat an international standard for the treatment of WPM (ISPM 15) is being implemented by many countries. In addition the United States has considered application of similar requirements to WPM used in domestic and bilateral trade with Canada. We use a domestic margin inclusive version of the Global Trade Analysis model to estimate the economic and trade impacts of ISPM 15 along with alternatives of varying stringency. We also estimate the economic impacts of one of the benefits of ISPM 15; averted United States forest owner timber losses. ISPM 15 is likely to have a small negative effect on exports and economic welfare for most countries. However there is significant regional and sectoral variation depending on the product mix traded. If ISPM 15 requirements are extended to United States domestic trade the impacts on the United States are stronger. Inclusion of averted United States timber losses partly but not completely offset welfare and trade impacts of the ISPM 15 treatment. These results must be tempered with the additional benefits of ISPM 15 in terms of potential averted household and environmental damages. . 1037:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This study estimates the economic losses attributable to a nonindigenous forest insect the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsuga) using cross sectional and difference in difference hedonic price models The data span a decade of residential property value transactions in West Milford New Jersey Hemlock health in naturally regenerated hemlock stands was measured biannually over this period using remote sensing data and the image differencing technique These data were linked with spatially referenced land use and land cover data measured twice during the decade and the locations and housing characteristics associated with parcels sold Spatial dependence in the regression models was addressed using spatial error and fixed effects panel data models The empirical results demonstrated that hemlock decline consistently caused statistically significant reductions in property values both for parcels containing hemlock resources as well as for neighboring nonhemlock parcels We conclude that failure to account for spatial spillover effects would downwardly bias estimates of economic losses and total economic losses on properties sold during the study period ranged from  DoLlQuAnT 0 64 million in the parcel level cross section model to  DoLlQuAnT 2 2 million in the 0 5 km neighborhood difference in difference model. 1050:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological invasions cause billions of dollars in economic damage each year and are a serious threat to native biodiversity. Introduced animals and plants may escape 75 PeRcEnT or more of the parasite and pathogen species from their native range. While they do accumulate novel parasite species from their new location this number is generally only a fraction of the number lost. Individual plants and animals are also generally less frequently infected (prevalence minus percent individuals infected) in introduced compared to native conspecific populations. In conjunction with other biological and physical factors release from parasites helps explain the increased demographic performance of invasive species potentially accounting for much of the damage they cause. 1056:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Extreme climatic events (ECEs) such as unusual heat waves hurricanes floods and droughts can dramatically affect ecological and evolutionary processes and these events are projected to become more frequent and more intense with ongoing climate change. However the implications of ECEs for biological invasions remain poorly understood. Using concepts and empirical evidence from invasion ecology we identify mechanisms by which ECEs may influence the invasion process from initial introduction through establishment and spread. We summarize how ECEs can enhance invasions by promoting the transport of propagules into new regions by decreasing the resistance of native communities to establishment and also sometimes by putting existing non native species at a competitive disadvantage. Finally we outline priority research areas and management approaches for anticipating future risks of unwanted invasions following ECEs. Given predicted increases in both ECE occurrence and rates of species introductions around the globe during the coming decades there is an urgent need to understand how these two processes interact to affect ecosystem composition and functioning. 1063:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many non native plants in the US have become problematic invaders of native and managed ecosystems but a new generation of invasive species may be at our doorstep. Here we review trends in the horticultural trade and invasion patterns of previously introduced species and show that novel species introductions from emerging horticultural trade partners are likely to rapidly increase invasion risk. At the same time climate change and water restrictions are increasing demand for new types of species adapted to warm and dry environments. This confluence of forces could expose the US to a range of new invasive species including many from tropical and semiarid Africa as well as the Middle East. Risk assessment strategies have proven successful elsewhere at identifying and preventing invasions although some modifications are needed to address emerging threats. Now is the time to implement horticulture import screening measures to prevent this new wave of plant invasions. 1073:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Trade in live plants has been recognized worldwide as an important invasion pathway for non native plant pests. Such pests can have severe economic and ecological consequences. Nearly 70 PeRcEnT of damaging forest insects and pathogens established in the US between 1860 and 2006 most likely entered on imported live plants. The current regulation of plant imports is outdated and needs to balance the impacts of pest damage the expense of mitigation efforts and the benefits of live plant importation. To inform these discussions we document large increases in the volume and value of plant imports over the past five decades and explain recent and proposed changes to plant import regulations. Two data sources were used to estimate the infestation rate of regulated pests in live plant shipments entering the US thus allowing evaluation of the efficacy of the current port inspection process. 1078:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A prevalent question in the study of plant invasions has been whether or not invasions can be explained on the basis of traits. Despite many attempts a synthetic view of multi trait differences between alien and native species is not yet available. We compiled a database of three ecologically important traits (specific leaf area typical maximum canopy height individual seed mass) for 4473 species sampled over 95 communities (3784 species measured in their native range 689 species in their introduced range 207 in both ranges). Considering each trait separately co occurring native and alien species significantly differed in their traits. These differences although modest were expressed in a combined 15 PeRcEnT higher specific leaf area 16 PeRcEnT lower canopy height and 26 PeRcEnT smaller seeds. Using three novel multi trait metrics of functional diversity aliens showed significantly smaller trait ranges larger divergences and a consistent differentiation from the median trait combination of co occurring natives. We conclude that the simultaneous evaluation of multiple traits is an important novel direction in understanding invasion success. Our results support the phenotypic divergence hypothesis that predicts functional trait differences contribute to the success of alien species. 1083:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Classical theory predicts that colonizing ability should increase with fecundity. Additionally it has recently been shown that successful establishment of birds was correlated with relative brain size which was suggested as possibly universal among vertebrates. I conducted a comparative study of establishment success in global fish introductions controlling for regional geographic differences to test these hypothesized correlates. In 133 introductions of 17 fish species establishment success was negatively associated with fecundity while there was no evidence for an effect of relative brain size. In analysis of partially overlapping data there was no evidence of a correlation between relative brain size and establishment rate across 39 species. One explanation for the negative association with fecundity is that parental investment might be more important to establishment than fecundity. In 126 introductions of 14 species reproductive behaviours associated with parental investment were significantly associated with establishment success. These results suggest that the correlation between brain size and establishment success is not universal. 1123:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most studies of exotic species invasions only consider the factors that affect the establishment of populations following release yet this is only one step on the invasion pathway. Different factors are likely to influence which species are transported and released. Here we examine the influence of species traits on the successful transition of species through several stages in the introduction pathway (transport release and establishment) using parrots (Aves: Psittaciformes) as a model system. We use a species level supertree of parrots to test for phylogenetic auto correlation in the introduction process. Our analyses find that different sets of variables are related to the probability that a species enters each stage on the invasion pathway. The availability of individuals for transport and release seems to be most important for passage through these stages but has no obvious effect on establishment following release. Rather establishment success is higher for sedentary species and species with broad diets. 1126:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Non native invasive grasses have been linked to altered grass fire cycles worldwide. Although a few studies have quantified resulting changes in fire activity at local scales and many have speculated about larger scales regional alterations to fire regimes remain poorly documented. We assessed the influence of large scale Bromus tectorum (hereafter cheatgrass) invasion on fire size duration spread rate and interannual variability in comparison to other prominent land cover classes across the Great Basin USA. We compared regional land cover maps to burned area measured using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 20002009 and to fire extents recorded by the USGS registry of fires from 1980 to 2009. Cheatgrass dominates at least 6 PeRcEnT of the central Great Basin (650 000 km(2)). MODIS records show that 13 PeRcEnT of these cheatgrass dominated lands burned resulting in a fire return interval of 78 years for any given location within cheatgrass. This proportion was more than double the amount burned across all other vegetation types (range: 0.56 PeRcEnT burned). During the 1990s this difference was even more extreme with cheatgrass burning nearly four times more frequently than any native vegetation type (16 PeRcEnT of cheatgrass burned compared to 15 PeRcEnT of native vegetation). Cheatgrass was also disproportionately represented in the largest fires comprising 24 PeRcEnT of the land area of the 50 largest fires recorded by MODIS during the 2000s. Furthermore multi date fires that burned across multiple vegetation types were significantly more likely to have started in cheatgrass. Finally cheatgrass fires showed a strong interannual response to wet years a trend only weakly observed in native vegetation types. These results demonstrate that cheatgrass invasion has substantially altered the regional fire regime. Although this result has been suspected by managers for decades this study is the first to document recent cheatgrass driven fire regimes at a regional scale. 1173:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Dreissena polymorpha population densities and biomass were followed in three Belarusian lakes with different trophic status over a 12 year period subsequent to initial colonization. In all three lakes zebra mussel population densities did not change once they reached a maximum. Application of the Ramcharan . 1992. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 49: 2611 2620 model for predicting population dynamics of zebra mussels was accurate for two of the three lakes studied. Population density appears to depend on the time since initial colonization relative abundance of substrate available for colonization lake morphometry and trophic type. Zebra mussel distribution within lakes was highly patchy but the degree of dispersion decreased over time after initial colonization which may be a result of saturation of suitable substrates by zebra mussels as populations increase and reach carrying capacity. In lakes where submerged macrophytes are the dominant substrate for zebra mussel attachment populations may be less stable than in lakes with a variety of substrates which will have a more balanced age distribution and be less impacted by year to year variation in recruitment. Dreissena polymorpha usually reach maximum population density 7 12 years after initial introduction. However the timing of initial introduction is often very difficult to determine. Both European and North American data suggest that zebra mussels reach maximum density in about 2 3 years after populations are large enough to be detected. 1175:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The genus Mnemiopsis is comprised of a single species Mnemiopsis leidyi A. Agassiz 1865 that has recently made the transition from a distribution limited to the Atlantic coasts of North and South America to an invasive range that includes the Black Caspian Mediterranean North and Baltic seas. We review the foundations of the ctenophores invasive success which include the source sink dynamics that characterize Mnemiopsis populations in temperate coastal waters where the ctenophore achieves its highest biomass levels and ecosystem impacts. Within its native temperate range Mnemiopsis is frequently a dominant seasonal colonizing species with limited dispersal capacities. Cross oceanic transport within ballast waters of intercontinental shipping vessels has altered this dispersal limitation and initiated a rapid global spread of Mnemiopsis. Owing to continuing transport via transoceanic shipping we anticipate continued range expansion and review the variables most likely to determine whether introduction of Mnemiopsis to a novel community results in an inconspicuous addition or a disruptive invasion. 1189:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The size of the Mexican overwintering population of monarch butterflies has decreased over the last decade. Approximately half of these butterflies come from the U.S. Midwest where larvae feed on common milkweed. There has been a large decline in milkweed in agricultural fields in the Midwest over the last decade. This loss is coincident with the increased use of glyphosate herbicide in conjunction with increased planting of genetically modified (GM) glyphosate tolerant corn (maize) and soybeans (soya). We investigate whether the decline in the size of the overwintering population can be attributed to a decline in monarch production owing to a loss of milkweeds in agricultural fields in the Midwest. We estimate Midwest annual monarch production using data on the number of monarch eggs per milkweed plant for milkweeds in different habitats the density of milkweeds in different habitats and the area occupied by those habitats on the landscape. We estimate that there has been a 58 PeRcEnT decline in milkweeds on the Midwest landscape and an 81 PeRcEnT decline in monarch production in the Midwest from 1999 to 2010. Monarch production in the Midwest each year was positively correlated with the size of the subsequent overwintering population in Mexico. Taken together these results strongly suggest that a loss of agricultural milkweeds is a major contributor to the decline in the monarch population. The smaller monarch population size that has become the norm will make the species more vulnerable to other conservation threats. 1224:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A model of the population dynamics of Banksia ornata was developed using stochastic dynamic programming (a state dependent decision making tool) to determine optimal fire management strategies that incorporate trade offs between biodiversity conservation and fuel reduction. The modelled population of B. ornata was described by its age and density and was exposed to the risk of unplanned fires and stochastic variation in germination success. For a given population in each year three management strategies were considered: (i) lighting a prescribed fire; (ii) controlling the incidence of unplanned fire; (iii) doing nothing. The optimal management strategy depended on the state of the B. ornata population with the time since the last fire (age of the population) being the most important variable. Lighting a prescribed fire at an age of less than 30 years was only optimal when the density of seedlings after a fire was low (  100 plants ha( 1)) or when there were benefits of maintaining a low fuel load by using more frequent fire. Because the cost of management was assumed to be negligible (relative to the value of the persistence of the population) the do nothing option was never the optimal strategy although lighting prescribed fires had only marginal benefits when the mean interval between unplanned fires was less than 20 30 years. 1225:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Establishing biological control agents in the field is a major step in any classical biocontrol programme yet there are few general guidelines to help the practitioner decide what factors might enhance the establishment of such agents. A stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) approach linked to a metapopulation model was used to find optimal release strategies (number and size of releases) given constraints on time and the number of biocontrol agents available. By modelling within a decision making framework we derived rules of thumb that will enable biocontrol workers to choose between management options depending on the current state of the system. When there are few well established sites making a few large releases is the optimal strategy. For other states of the system the optimal strategy ranges from a few large releases through a mixed strategy (a variety of release sizes) to many small releases as the probability of establishment of smaller inocula increases. Given that the probability of establishment is rarely a known entity we also strongly recommend a mixed strategy in the early stages of a release programme to accelerate learning and improve the chances of finding the optimal approach. 1244:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To evaluate the effect of mis specifying the correct comparison of species pools in the study of species characteristics associated with the biological introduction of exotic species. We use a high quality data set on biological introductions of parrots (Aves: Psittaciformes). These data allow us to examine relationships between life history traits and probability of successful transition through an introduction stage when the species pool is both correctly and incorrectly specified. For the establishment of introduced parrot species nearly half of the predictor variables showed different patterns of significance when an incorrect pool was specified. Multivariate analysis identified entirely different sets of variables as independent predictors of establishment success depending on the species pool used. Correct pool specification identified that introduced parrot species have been more likely to establish if they have broader diets and are more sedentary. Conclusions from the analysis of biological introductions are likely to depend on the specification of the species pool for such analyses. In the analysis of parrot introductions this was particularly apparent in establishment success following release. Further studies that analyse the introduction pathway need to examine the effects of pool mis specification so that the generality of our results can be assessed. 124:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Introduced species can compete with prey upon or transmit disease to native forms resulting in devastation of indigenous communities. A more subtle but equally severe effect of exotic species is as a supplemental food source for predators that allows them to increase in abundance and then overexploit native prey species. Here we show that the introduction of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) to the California Channel Islands has sustained an unnaturally large breeding population of golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) a native predator. The resulting increase in predation on the island fox (Urocyon littoralis) has caused the near extirpation of three subspecies of this endemic carnivore. Foxes evolved on the islands over the past 20 000 years pigs were introduced in the 1850s and golden eagles historically were only transient visitors. Although these three species have been sympatric for the past 150 years this predator prey interaction is a recent phenomenon occurring within the last decade. We hypothesize that this interaction ultimately stems from human induced perturbations to the island mainland and surrounding marine environments. 1262:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecosystem engineers are organisms that change abiotic conditions in ways that affect the performance and distribution of other species including exotics. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the successful establishment of exotic plants in natural communities but the positive effects that native engineer species may have on the distribution and performance of exotic plants remain unknown. In this study we propose that amelioration of extreme abiotic conditions by ecosystem engineers can make stressful habitats invadable by exotic plant species with larger positive effects on the performance of exotic plants as environmental harshness increases. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the effects of a high Andean ecosystem engineer the cushion plant Azorella monantha which is known to create habitat patches where environmental conditions are less extreme than in the surrounding habitats on the distribution and the performance of two exotic plant species field chickweed (Cerastium arvense) and common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) along a an elevation gradient in the Andes of central Chile. We measured and compared the abundance biomass and survival of both exotic species within and outside cushion habitat patches at three elevations (3200 m 3400 m and 3600 m) and evaluated whether the effects of A. monantha varied across elevations. The results indicated that cushion plants positively impact the performance of both exotics and have greater facilitative effects at higher elevations. Indeed at the higher elevation site C. arvense was only detected within A. monantha patches suggesting that cushions may expand the distribution range of exotics. These results suggest that ecosystem engineering by native species could promote biological invasions in harsh environments leading to higher abundances of invaders than those expected in the absence of engineers. Given the conspicuousness of ecosystem engineering in nature we suggest that exotic species eradication programmes might be less successful by not taking into account the facilitative effects of native engineer species on invaders. Further we suggest that the recent proposals to use engineer species in ecosystem restoration should be aware of their potential role in promoting invasions. 1268:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Invasive species increasingly threaten ecosystems food production and human welfare worldwide. Hundreds of eradication programs have targeted a wide range of nonnative insect species to mitigate the economic and ecological impacts of biological invasions. Many such programs used multiple tactics to achieve this goal but interactions between tactics have received little formal consideration specifically as they interact with Allee dynamics. If a population can be driven below an Allee threshold extinction becomes more probable because of factors such as the failure to find mates satiate natural enemies or successfully exploit food resources as well as demographic and environmental stochasticity. A key implication of an Allee threshold is that the population can be eradicated without the need and expense of killing the last individuals. Some combinations of control tactics could interact with Allee dynamics to increase the probability of successful eradication. Combinations of tactics can be considered to have synergistic (greater efficiency in achieving extinction from the combination) additive (no improvement over single tactics alone) or antagonistic (reduced efficiency from the combination) effects on Allee dynamics. We highlight examples of combinations of tactics likely to act synergistically additively or antagonistically on pest populations. By exploiting the interacting effects of multiple tactics on Allee dynamics the success and cost effectiveness of eradication programs can be enhanced. 1323:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We contrast ecological and life history traits of the well studied freshwater invader the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) with the lesser known invasive golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) to compare salient biological traits and environmental limits and to predict the potential spread and ecosystem impacts of L.fortunei in areas where it is introduced. Both species are sessile byssate bivalves with a planktonic larval stage and extremely high reproductive capacity. For both species adults attain much higher biomass in waterbodies they invade than all of the Dative invertebrates combined and they create substrate complexity otherwise not found in freshwater systems. Both are very active suspension feeders greatly enhance benthicpelagic coupling and act as effective ecosystem engineers. Although taxonomically unrelated their ecosystem impacts are surprisingly similar and follow from the novel ecological niche they share rather than being species specific. The golden mussel has broader environmental tolerances and therefore may be a much more successful invader than D. polymorpha in regions dominated by acidic soft and contaminated waters. In the near future L. fortunei may colonize the southern and central parts of North America much farther north than has been previously predicted. Although to date the zebra mussel is considered the most aggressive freshwater invader soon many waterbodies may receive another even more aggressive invader. 1344:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tallgrass prairies are characterized by high levels of litter production which has a profound effect on live biomass. Litter introduces a delayed inhibition of biomass growth generating nonlinear dynamics and chaos. In this paper we study a model of biomass litter interaction and focus on the litter persistence rate. The observed dynamics depends largely on this rate of year to year persistence. Different scenarios are explored and discussed. A spatially extended counterpart of such a model is later on introduced to account for the effects of space. Temporal chaos introduces spatial heterogeneity in terms of gaps where the current year biomass is almost zero. Such gaps can be colonized by fugitive species. The inhibitory effect of litter on biomass is thus an important source of intrinsic small scale heterogeneities that may promote diversity. On the other hand the huge amounts of litter produced by the competitive dominants in tallgrass prairies enhance the probability of fires. Fires benefit rather than depress the superior competitive species. This fact explains why the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) stating that the highest diversity levels should be observed at intermediate disturbance frequencies does not work in these communities. We define self disturbances as small scale disturbances affecting the growth and survival of the individuals that have generated them  due to the effects of the litter mass they produce). In the absence of other disturbances self disturbances can induce high heterogeneity and diversity levels in tallgrass prairies. We discuss the general implications of self generated disturbances for landscape heterogeneity and diversity of communities in which the main external perturbations benefit the dominant species. 1446:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, While some governments are preoccupied with preventing border crossings by terrorists thousands of alien species (those from other regions or continents) continue to be allowed free entry into most countries of the world. Some of these alien species are certain to cause great harm to the environment native species national economies and human health as other species have done in the past. In this era of supposedly great attention to border security how do the aliens keep on getting through? Commercial markets in live food pets horticulture and aquaculture intentionally import a wide range of alien species into many countries every year with little government supervision and often no analysis of the attendant environmental health and financial risks. Thousands of other species hitch hike on legitimate cargo or the ships planes and other vehicles that carry them. Most of these aliens will do little or no harm but some will cause irreversible damage. Recent examples include the North American grey squirrel in Europe; the Asian longhorned beetle in North America; the Northern Pacific seastar and the Surinam toad in Australia; the European red deer in South America; the South American water hyacinth in Africa; and the Australian brown tree snake on Pacific islands. Changing patterns of trade mean that increasing numbers of alien species come from previously isolated regions. The environmental and economic damage wrought by alien species includes the extinction of native species and large alterations in ecosystem characteristics such as nutrient fluxes and fire frequency. Charles Elton anticipated many of these environmental effects in his 1958 book The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants. Indeed it often seems that invasion biology (a recent addition to the list of biological subspecialisms) is little more than Elton redux. However in Alien Species and Evolution George Cox extends traditional concerns about alien species beyond the ecological theatre and puts the evolutionary play on centre stage. His main concern is genetic change both in alien species which are subject to founder effects and new selection pressures and in native species as they experience new selection pressures imposed by the aliens. This extremely readable book is aimed primarily at students and researchers. Cox provides comprehensive coverage of alien species in different taxonomic groups and in different habitats: terrestrial freshwater and marine. Replete with examples and abundantly referenced the book provides an excellent evolutionary synthesis. Cox occasionally makes extended forays beyond alien species but only to illustrate the broader context in which adaptation and counteradaptation occur. The book is therefore also a good introduction to the broader intellectual landscape of evolution and global environmental change. The coverage of hybridization between alien and native species may be particularly useful as many readers might not have encountered it before. The interaction between hybridization and polyploidy has already produced a number of new terrestrial plant species from ancestral species for instance when European salsifies (Tragopogon) were introduced into North America. Hybridization and introgression have also been common in freshwater fishes crustaceans and molluscs as human interventions have brought closely related species together. This often results in the loss of native species as an evolutionary and ecological entity as well as a chance to study evolution in action. Cox provides a guide to other research topics where an understanding of evolution is essential including the development of invasion resistance by native communities. He considers evolution during lag times of invasion which arise because different lifehistory characteristics are often required for dispersal and persistence in a particular environment. Cox also provides an introduction to coevolution between alien and native species and to the effect of invasion on geographic speciation __ although he makes it clear that this result is relatively minor compared with extinctions caused by invasions. Little explicit attention is given to policy responses to species introductions but Cox illustrates the need for greater consideration of evolutionary processes in risk analyses for alien species. In particular he gives several examples of hybridization between wild species and related crops that have been genetically engineered for resistance to herbicides or insect pests. Transgenes have already flowed (or almost certainly will if they havent already) from cultivated sorghum into Johnson grass from oilseed rape into field mustard from sunflower crops into wild sunflowers and from wheat into jointed goatgrass. Wild species do not seem to suffer any reduction in fitness from incorporating some transgenes contrary to the claims of many proponents of genetic engineering so there are likely to be detrimental effects on native insects. Cox convincingly makes the case that evolution is central to any understanding of invasions and that the analysis of risk is incomplete without a consideration of evolution. 1463:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Damage caused by introduced species results from the high population densities and large body sizes that they attain in their new location(1 4). Escape from the effects of natural enemies is a frequent explanation given for the success of introduced species(5 6). Because some parasites can reduce host density(7 13) and decrease body size(14) an invader that leaves parasites behind and encounters few new parasites can experience a demographic release and become a pest(4 15). To test whether introduced species are less parasitized we have compared the parasites of exotic species in their native and introduced ranges using 26 host species of molluscs crustaceans fishes birds mammals amphibians and reptiles. Here we report that the number of parasite species found in native populations is twice that found in exotic populations. In addition introduced populations are less heavily parasitized (in terms of percentage infected) than are native populations. Reduced parasitization of introduced species has several causes including reduced probability of the introduction of parasites with exotic species (or early extinction after host establishment) absence of other required hosts in the new location and the host specific limitations of native parasites adapting to new hosts. 1471:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Invasive plant species both threaten native biodiversity and are economically costly(1 5) but only a few naturalized species become pests(2 4). Here we report broad quantitative support for two long standing hypotheses that explain why only some naturalized species have large impacts. The enemy release hypothesis argues that invaders impacts result from reduced natural enemy attack(2 4 6 10). The biotic resistance hypothesis argues that interactions with native species including natural enemies limit invaders impacts(6 8). We tested these hypotheses for viruses and for rust smut and powdery mildew fungi that infect 473 plant species naturalized to the United States from Europe. On average 84 PeRcEnT fewer fungi and 24 PeRcEnT fewer virus species infect each plant species in its naturalized range than in its native range. In addition invasive plant species that are more completely released from pathogens are more widely reported as harmful invaders of both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Together these results strongly support the enemy release hypothesis. Among noxious agricultural weeds species accumulating more pathogens in their naturalized range are less widely noxious supporting the biotic resistance hypothesis. Our results indicate that invasive plants impacts may be a function of both release from and accumulation of natural enemies including pathogens. 1499:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We suggest that the spread of angiosperms in the Cretaceous was facilitated by novel fire regimes. Angiosperms were capable of high productivity and therefore accumulated flammable biomass (fuel) more rapidly than their predecessors. They were capable of rapid reproduction allowing populations to spread despite frequent disturbance. We evaluate the evidence for physical conditions conducive to fires in the Cretaceous. These included high temperatures seasonally dry climate and higher atmospheric oxygen than current levels. We evaluate novel properties of angiosperms that contributed to rapid biomass accumulation and to their ability to thrive in frequently disturbed environments. We also review direct evidence for Cretaceous fires. Charcoal mesofossils are common in Cretaceous deposits of the Northern Hemisphere. Inertinite the charcoal component of coal is common throughout the Cretaceous and into the Palaeocene but declined steeply from the Eocene when angiosperm dominated forests became widespread. Direct and indirect evidence is consistent with angiosperms initiating novel fire regimes promoting angiosperm spread in the Cretaceous. Several traits are consistent with frequent surface fires. We suggest that forest was slow to develop until the Eocene when fire activity dropped to very low levels. The causes and consequences of fires in the deep past warrant greater attention. 1524:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although rarely examined apparent competition whereby exotic plants increase consumer pressure on native plants could play a significant role in affecting native plant establishment in invaded habitats. Moreover although terrestrial consumer communities often contain many consumer species little is known about which consumers may generate apparent competition and whether the strength or mechanism of apparent competition differs among different members of the consumer community. Using consumer specific experimental exclosures and seed additions in the invaded grasslands of California we demonstrate that multiple mechanisms of apparent competition are capable of limiting the re establishment of the native grass Nassella pulchra in the absence of direct competition with exotic plants. The effect of small mammalian consumers (mice and voles) and larger consumers  rabbits squirrels deer) decreased with distance to the exotic forb Brassica nigra which varied from 0 33 meters from focal N. pulchra. The effect of larger consumers also depended upon characteristics of the plant community directly adjacent  approx. 1 m) from focal N. pulchra. The effect of large consumers also increased with the richness of the exotic plant community and the degree to which the exotic plant community was dominated by exotic grasses as opposed to exotic forbs. Our finding that apparent competition can be driven by different mechanisms that the importance of each mechanism depends upon which consumers have access and that each mechanism has a different spatial extent suggests that the composition of both the consumer community and the exotic plant community may shape the spatial dynamics of reestablishment the potential for restoration and the need for conservation. 1530:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Community composition and diversity arise from limitations in propagule supply  propagule or seed limitation) and propagule establishment after arriving at a site  establishment or microsite limitation). Recent meta analyses suggest that the degree of propagule limitation depends on local abiotic and biotic conditions which in turn are likely to vary spatially and temporally. Nevertheless seed addition studies testing propagule limitation are rarely replicated in multiple locations and years and often lack experimental manipulations of critical determinants of propagule limitation such as the density and species richness of the propagule pool and disturbance and resource supply of recipient site. The invasion of California (USA) grasslands by exotic annual species from the Mediterranean region is unique in its scope (over 9 million ha) and persistence (more than 150 years). This invasion provides an exciting context in which to test the role of spatial and temporal variability in mediating propagule limitation and ultimately the potential for restoration. Here I present the results of native grass seed addition trials conducted along a 500 km gradient in California in three consecutive years spanning a wide range of environmental conditions and initial conditions  rainfall seeding density and disturbance). While native grasses were able to establish at many locations per capita seed survival was low suggesting that the fate of these species is governed by interplay between propagule and establishment limitation. Establishment primarily varied spatially with the most successful establishment occurring at fertile locations with low resident species richness. While recruitment was highly variable among years initially there was no difference among seedling trials after three years. 1534:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Determining combinations of functional traits that allow a species to colonize new habitats has been central in the development of invasion ecology. Species able to establish in new communities harbor abilities or traits that allow them to use resources or tolerate stress in ways that native species cannot. Tradeoffs among species functional traits along the competitioncolonization (CC) continuum where competitive ability is a decreasing function of dispersal capacity may allow invasive species to establish themselves in new habitats. The California flora offers a well characterized model system to examine whether native and exotic species differ in the distribution of functional traits and to examine whether a breakdown of the CC tradeoff is present. We used a random subset of 1000 plants and examined seed traits and life form characteristics along with their seed size and adult height using the Jepson Manual of the plants of California. To test the hypothesis that active dispersal strategies aid in the success of exotic species we classified species into four seed types according to the presence absence of mechanisms associated with efficient dispersal. In addition for each species we compiled data on seed size and adult plant height. We conducted all comparisons between native and exotic species within the four most speciose families to control for potential taxonomic non independence. Exotic species had smaller seed size but greater plant height than natives of the same families. On the other hand exotic species also displayed significantly greater proportions of functional traits that enhanced dispersal ability. Additionally certain sets of functional traits were significantly associated with exotic species such as annual life histories with small seeds and high dispersal capacity. In the random subset of the California flora examined exotics of the most speciose plant families show functional trait combinations that appear to violate the tradeoff structures observed in their California counterparts. Our results suggest that taxonomically controlled comparisons of the CC tradeoff structure between natives and exotic species may shed light of the capacity of those exotic species invasive ability to colonize new habitats. 153:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We reviewed over 407 global seaweed introduction events and have increased the total number of introduced seaweed species to 277. Using binomial tests we show that several algal families contain more successful invaders than would be expected by chance highlighting groups that should be targeted for management. Hull fouling and aquaculture are the most significant sources of seaweed invaders and should be carefully regulated. The ecological effects of introduced seaweeds have been studied in only 6 PeRcEnT of the species but these studies show mostly negative effects or changes to the native biota. Herbivores generally prefer native to introduced seaweeds and are unlikely to control spread as they can do in other habitats. Undisturbed marine communities can be at least initially resistant to most introduced seaweeds aside from the siphonous green species; however disturbances and eutrophication can facilitate invasion. Major research gaps include community level ecological studies and economic assessments. 1542:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Human activities have elevated the extinction of natural populations as well as the invasion of new areas by non native species. These dual processes of invasion and extinction may change the richness and similarity of communities but the form these changes take is likely to depend on the manner in which invasions and extinctions occur and the spatial scale at which the changes are measured. Here we explore the influence of differing patterns of extinction and invasion on the similarity and richness of a meta community. In particular we model simple stochastic processes analogous to realistic modes of human mediated introduction of non native species and range expansion by native species. We show that different modes of invasion and extinction can produce very different changes in diversity and that the relative magnitude of these changes depends both on where in the meta community diversity is measured and the degree of initial species aggregation. At any spatial scale of measurement changes in the richness and similarity of communities following invasion and extinction are not necessarily strongly coupled: relatively large increases in richness may or may not also be associated with relatively large increases in similarity among communities. Thus in real systems the influence of human induced invasions and extinctions on diversity will depend on both the precise mode of these processes (especially invasion) and how species populations are distributed across space. 1558:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The range of potential mechanisms limiting species distributions in space is nearly as varied and complex as the diversity of life itself. Yet viewed abstractly a species border is a geographic manifestation of a species demographic responses to a spatially and temporally varying world. Population dynamic models provide insight into the different routes by which range limits can arise owing to gradients in demographic rates. In a metapopulation context for example range limits may be caused by gradients in extinction rates colonization rates or habitat availability. We have consider invasion models in uniform and heterogeneous environments as a framework for understanding non equilibrium range limits and explore conditions under which invasions may cease to spread leaving behind a stationary range limit. We conclude that non equilibrial range dynamics need further theoretical and empirical attention. 1643:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A robust food web is one in which few secondary extinctions occur after removing species. We investigated how parasites affected the robustness of the Carpinteria Salt Marsh food web by conducting random species removals and a hypothetical but plausible species invasion. Parasites were much more likely than free living species to suffer secondary extinctions following the removal of a free living species from the food web. For this reason the food web was less robust with the inclusion of parasites. Removal of the horn snail Cerithidea californica resulted in a disproportionate number of secondary parasite extinctions. The exotic Japanese mud snail Batillaria attramentaria is the ecological analogue of the native California horn snail and can completely replace it following invasion. Owing to the similarities between the two snail species the invasion had no effect on predator prey interactions. However because the native snail is host for 17 host specific parasites and the invader is host to only one comparison of a food web that includes parasites showed significant effects of invasion on the native community. The hypothetical invasion also significantly reduced the connectance of the web because the loss of 17 native trematode species eliminated many links. 1660:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Karnal bunt of wheat (caused by Tilletia indica) was first detected in the United States in Arizona in 1996. The seed lots of infected spring habit durum wheat associated with the initial detection were traced to planted fields in California Arizona New Mexico and Texas. However in the summer of 1997 the disease appeared in unrelated winter habit bread wheat located over 700 kin from the nearest potentially contaminated wheat from 1996 (and destroyed prior to reinfection). Here we examined potential invasion pathways of the fungus associated with the movement of wheat into the United States. We analyzed the USDA APHIS Port Information Network (PIN) database from 1984 through 2000 to determine likely pathways of introduction based on where when and how the disease was intercepted coming into the United States. All interceptions were made on wheat transported from Mexico with the majority (98.8 PeRcEnT) being intercepted at land border crossings. Karnal bunt was not intercepted from any other country over the 17 year period analyzed. Most interceptions were on wheat found in automobiles trucks and railway cars. The majority of interceptions were made at Laredo Brownsville Eagle Pass and El Paso TX and Nogales AZ. Karnal bunt was intercepted in all 17 years; however interceptions peaked in 1986 and 1987. Averaged over all years more interceptions (19.2 PeRcEnT) were made in the month of May than in any other month. Our results indicate that Karnal bunt has probably arrived in the United States on many occasions at least since 1984. Because of the relatively unaggressive nature of the disease and its reliance on rather exacting weather conditions for infection we surmised that it is possible this disease has a long period of latent survival between initial arrival and becoming a thriving established disease. 1662:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Invasions by non native taxa can have severe consequences for native species. In the heavily invaded serpentine grasslands of central California many native species appear to be restricted to isolated outcrops of shallow serpentine soil or   hummocks    although the extent to which these hummocks function as refuges for native vegetation has never been quantified. We tested whether native plant species were restricted to hummocks within a serpentine grassland at the University of California Sedgwick Reserve near Santa Barbara California by sampling species along hummock grassland gradients. We also examined the influence of soil parameters hummock area proximity to other hummocks and spatial location on species composition across 16 hummocks at this site. Both the hummocks and the surrounding grassland had high Mg low Ca and low Ca to Mg ratios typical of serpentine systems. Hummocks appeared to be more stressful environments because of their shallower soils lower cation exchange capacity and greater percent sand. Of the 27 most common plant species sampled along hummock grassland transects we identified 8 hummock specialists 7 edge specialists 8 matrix specialists and 4 generalists. Importantly both the hummock and matrix specialist groups included native species. Plant community composition was correlated with spatial positioning of the hummocks and with soil Ca Na K and N. The number of species increased and community composition changed with increasing hummock area. Species composition was most similar among hummocks in close proximity to each other and decreased with increasing distance between hummocks. Our results suggest that the community structure of serpentine grasslands is spatially complex and an effective management or restoration plan must address this complexity. 1666:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A substantial portion of research occurs in places where scholars congregate__in campus laboratories in libraries or in large specialized facilities such as oceanographic ships astronomical observatories or accelerators. Under any of these circumstances researchers can interact easily exchanging ideas and information. Ecological research especially the large component occurring in the fi eld takes place in disparate locations all over the world__in the air on the surface and below the oceans lakes and crust of the planet. Although there are many biological field stations where scientists and students gather much of the research in ecology takes place in isolation. In addition to being highly dispersed geographically ecology encompasses a disparate range of disciplines at scales from molecules to the globe making the exchange of ideas and information even more difficult. Recognizing the benefits of interaction and collaboration the ecological community began considering a synthesis center where researchers from many fields could meet to address important ecological questions. Several organizations held discussions about the nature of such a center which culminated in two workshops hosted by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the early 1990s to set the scope. In 1994 NSF conducted an open competition for a synthesis center eventually granting the University of California Santa Barbara the award for the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). In addition to funding from NSF the center is supported by the University of California system and its Santa Barbara campus and by several foundations. The center employs various types of research approaches. A primary approach is through Working Groups (Figure 1) where scientists come to NCEAS to concentrate on specific issues requiring synthesis of ideas in depth analysis of data development of models and preparation of results. The groups generally visit NCEAS two to four times over two years and stay for three to ten days at a time. Working Group topics range from microbial diversity to global change and have included projects in sociology economics and computer science. The Center hosts about 100 meetings a year involving hundreds of participants. NCEAS also supports up to six visiting Center Fellows (sabbatical visitors) each year. These scientists often integrate their own research into a broader context or synthesize what is known about certain areas in ecology. Concurrently the Center houses 15 18 Postdoctoral Associates for one to three years each. These postdoctoral positions are distinctive in that there are no permanent mentors for the larval scientists__rather they interact with the other Associates the resident Fellows and the hundreds of individuals who annually visit the Center as part of Working Groups. The Center also conducts training activities including a distributed graduate seminar program. In this approach graduate students around the world become involved in seminars on specific topics using data from their region  the relationship between productivity and diversity) and then representatives from each of the seminars are brought to NCEAS for a grand synthesis. As would be expected for a discipline as broad as ecology the participants at NCEAS are extremely diverse. Over 3 000 individuals have visited NCEAS in just over eight years representing 43 countries and 49 states in the United States. They come from over 800 institutions many non biology departments and 397 non academic organizations  agencies and companies). An interesting measure of their breadth is that participants belong to more than 180 professional societies. Proposals are solicited twice a year and reviewed by a Science Advisory Board. The Board looks for topics that would benefit from synthesis and analysis and that would make significant contributions to our understanding of ecological relationships. While many proposals pertain to core ecological questions others deal with economics or sociology  how metaphors affect the way we conduct research). Approximately 40 PeRcEnT of the projects have some applied component many influencing resource management practices and conservation policies. Because the Center is based on the use of existing data access to highly dispersed and profoundly heterogeneous ecological information is essential but also very difficult. Recognizing the need for open access to a wide variety of data__versus project specific data solutions__NCEAS and several collaborators (see http: www.ecoinformatics.org) have embarked on a major research program in developing tools to characterize data and make them available in standardized formats. The initial research effort called the Knowledge Network for BioComplexity (KNB) is yielding tools to generate metadata (precise information about the data) and to make all the data available. The current research thrust called Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge will expand the capabilities of KNB by employing grid technology (in particular EcoGrid a network of networks) semantic mediation knowledge representation and workflow models for analysis and synthesis. The Center has supported almost 200 projects the results of which are published in top scientific journals (see project results at http: www.nceas.ucsb.edu). Furthermore some of the projects have had direct influence on conservation and resource management. For example scientists at NCEAS developed theories for the design of marine reserves that were soon thereafter applied to the placement of reserves directly off the coast of Santa Barbara. In addition to scientific results NCEAS is changing the way we conduct ecological research through novel means of encouraging productive collaborations. Sociologists studying the NCEAS model of collaboration have identified several important factors in its success. These include a distant neutral location facilitating periodic highly focused opportunities to concentrate on the issues under consideration; logistic support that lowers the activation energy required to develop collaborations; and the proximity of scientists from many disciplines having the opportunity to interact in ways otherwise not possible. Many significant contributions to our understanding of the patterns and processes of the natural world have emerged from NCEAS research activities. In addition the Center is fostering new forms of collaboration and interdisciplinary research by providing a place where scientists from many disciplines can productively interact and by working to make eclectic ecological data available to many users. This is an extremely simple model for the scientific enterprise__but one not captured in most existing institutional and organizational structures. As recognition of the success of NCEAS spreads other institutions are attempting to incorporate some of the traits of the Center into their operations and new centers are being proposed. For example the NSF is in the midst of a review of proposals for an evolution synthesis center. It is clear that the complexity of ecological systems as well as the importance of understanding and maintaining them requires information and knowledge from many disciplines. This is true even at a time when disciplines are becoming more specialized and scientists have less time to concentrate on broader issues. By facilitating interactions among many scholars and practitioners NCEAS provides both time when and a place where far reaching topics can be addressed. 166:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1729:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Disease may play a critical role in invasions by nonnative plants and animals that currently threaten global biodiversity. For example a generalist viral pathogen has been recently implicated in one of the most extensive plant invasions worldwide the invasion and domination of Californias perennial grasslands by exotic annual grasses. To date disease has never been quantitatively assessed as a cause of this invasion. Using a model with field estimated parameters we demonstrate that pathogen presence was necessary to reverse competitive outcome and to allow exotic annual grass invasion and dominance. Although pathogen induced reversal of a competitive hierarchy has been suggested as a mechanism of species invasion here we quantitatively demonstrate the importance of this phenomenon by using field derived parameters in a dynamical model. Pathogen mediated reversals in competitive balance may be critically important for understanding past and predicting future invasions. 1742:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, International commerce in live organisms presents a policy challenge for trade globalization; sales of live organisms create wealth but some nonindigenous species cause harm. To reduce damage some countries have implemented species screening to limit the introduction of damaging species. Adoption of new risk assessment (RA) technologies has been slowed however by concerns that RA accuracy remains insufficient to produce positive net economic benefits. This concern arises because only a small proportion of all introduced species escape spread and cause harm  become invasive) so a RA will exclude many noninvasive species (which provide a net economic benefit) for every invasive species correctly identified. Here we develop a simple cost:benefit bioeconomic framework to quantify the net benefits from applying species prescreening. Because invasive species are rarely eradicated and their damages must therefore be borne for long periods we have projected the value of RA over a suitable range of policy time horizons (10 500 years). We apply the model to the Australian plant quarantine program and show that this RA program produces positive net economic benefits over the range of reasonable assumptions. Because we use low estimates of the financial damage caused by invasive species and high estimates of the value of species in the ornamental trade our results underestimate the net benefit of the Australian plant quarantine program. In addition because plants have relatively low rates of invasion applying screening protocols to animals would likely demonstrate even greater benefits. 1760:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Predation by exotic species has caused the extinction of many native animal species on islands whereas competition from exotic plants has caused few native plant extinctions. Exotic plant addition to islands is highly nonrandom with an almost perfect 1 to 1 match between the number of naturalized and native plant species on oceanic islands. Here we evaluate several alternative implications of these findings. Does the consistency of increase in plant richness across islands imply that a saturation point in species richness has been reached? If not should we expect total plant richness to continue to increase as new species are added? Finally is the rarity of native plant extinctions to date a misleading measure of the impact of past invasions one that hides an extinction debt that will be paid in the future? By analyzing historical records we show that the number of naturalized plant species has increased linearly over time on many individual islands. Further the mean ratio of naturalized to native plant species across islands has changed steadily for nearly two centuries. These patterns suggest that many more species will become naturalized on islands in the future. We also discuss how dynamics of invasion bear upon alternative saturation scenarios and the implications these scenarios have for the future retention or extinction of native plant species. Finally we identify invasion motivated research gaps (propagule pressure time lags to extinction abundance shifts and loss of area) that can aid in forecasting extinction and in developing a more comprehensive theory of species extinctions. 1763:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species invasions are a principal component of global change causing large losses in biodiversity as well as economic damage. Invasion theory attempts to understand and predict invasion success and patterns of spread. However there is no consensus regarding which species or community attributes enhance invader success or explain spread dynamics. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that regulation of spread dynamics is possible; however the conditions for its existence have not yet been empirically demonstrated. If invasion spread is a regulated process the structure that accounts for this regulation will be a main determinant of invasion dynamics. Here we explore the existence of regulation underlying changes in the rate of new site colonization. We employ concepts and analytical tools from the study of abundance dynamics and show that spread dynamics are in fact regulated processes and that the regulation structure is notably consistent among invasions occurring in widely different contexts. We base our conclusions on the analysis of the spread dynamics of 30 species invasions including birds amphibians fish invertebrates plants and a virus all of which exhibited similar regulation structures. In contrast to current beliefs that species invasions are idiosyncratic phenomena here we provide evidence that general patterns do indeed exist. 1770:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The dynamics of invasive species may depend on their abilities to compete for resources and exploit disturbances relative to the abilities of native species. We test this hypothesis and explore its implications for the restoration of native ecosystems in one of the most dramatic ecological invasions worldwide the replacement of native perennial grasses by exotic annual grasses and forbs in 9.2 million hectares of California grasslands. The long term persistence of these exotic annuals has been thought to imply that the exotics are superior competitors. However seed addition experiments in a southern California grassland revealed that native perennial species which had lower requirements for deep soil water soil nitrate and light were strong competitors and they markedly depressed the abundance and fecundity of exotic annuals after overcoming recruitment limitations. Native species reinvaded exotic grasslands across experimentally imposed nitrogen water and disturbance gradients. Thus exotic annuals are not superior competitors but rather may dominate because of prior disturbance and the low dispersal abilities and extreme current rarity of native perennials. If our results prove to be general it may be feasible to restore native California grassland flora to at least parts of its former range. 1804:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Invasive species threaten biological diversity throughout the world. Understanding the dynamics of their spread is critical to mitigating this threat. In Australia efforts are underway to control the invasive cane toad (Chaunus Bufo marinus). Range models based on their native bioclimatic envelope suggest that the cane toad is nearing the end of its invasion phase. However such models assume a conserved niche between native and invaded regions and the absence of evolution to novel habitats. Here we develop a dynamically updated statistical model to predict the growing extent of cane toad range based on their current distribution in Australia. Results demonstrate that Australian cane toads may already have the ability to spread across an area that almost doubles their current range and that triples projections based on their native distribution. Most of the expansion in suitable habitat area has occurred in the last decade and in regions characterized by high temperatures. Increasing use of extreme habitats may indicate that novel ecological conditions have facilitated a broader realized niche or that toad populations at the invasion front have evolved greater tolerance to extreme abiotic conditions. Rapid evolution to novel habitats combined with ecological release from native enemies may explain why some species become highly successful global invaders. Predicting species ranges following invasion or climate change may often require dynamically updated range models that incorporate a broader realization of niches in the absence of natural enemies and evolution in response to novel habitats. 1814:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Preventing the establishment of invading pest species can be beneficial with respect to averting future environmental and economic impacts and also in preventing the accumulation of control costs. Allee effects play an important role in the dynamics of newly established low density populations by driving small populations into self extinction making Allee effects critical in influencing outcomes of eradication efforts. We consider interactions between management tactics in the presence of Allee effects to determine cost effective and time efficient combinations to achieve eradication by developing a model that considers pesticide application predator augmentation and mating disruption as control tactics using the gypsy moth as a case study. Our findings indicate that given a range of constant expenditure levels applying moderate levels of pesticides in conjunction with mating disruption increases the Allee threshold which simultaneously substantially decreases the time to eradication relative to either tactic alone. In contrast increasing predation in conjunction with other tactics requires larger economic expenditures to achieve similar outcomes for the use of pesticide application or mating disruption alone. These results demonstrate the beneficial synergy that may arise from nonlinearities associated with the simultaneous application of multiple eradication tactics and offer new prospects for preventing the establishment of damaging non native species. 1837:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Species invasions have long been regarded as enormously complex processes so complex as to defy predictivity. Phases of this process however are emerging as highly predictable: the potential geographic course of an invasion can be anticipated with high precision based on the ecological niche characteristics of a species in its native geographic distributional area. This predictivity depends on the premise that ecological niches constitute long term stable constraints on the potential geographic distributions of species for which a sizeable body of evidence is accumulating. Hence although the entire invasion process is indeed complex the geographic course that invasions are able to take can be anticipated with considerable confidence. 1863:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Hyperbolic discounting exists when a persons marginal rates of time preference decrease as the benefits received move farther and farther into the future. This paper explores whether applying hyperbolic discounting rather than the standard presumption of constant discounting matters for a natural resource policy question. We find that hyperbolic discounting does matter based on actual time preferences observed in laboratory experiments the results now justify the policy to protect native cutthroat trout from exotic lake trout in Yellowstone Lake. We find however that hyperbolic discounting matters in exactly the same conditions under which the policy decisions are time inconsistent. 1879:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Native consumers and seed limitation may be particularly important in the restoration of native plants where they have been displaced by exotic plants. We used experimental exclosures and seed additions to examine the role of native mammalian consumers and seeding density (500 or 1 000 seeds m(2)) in affecting the establishment of a native perennial grass Purple needlegrass (Nassella pulchra) in the grasslands of California. To focus solely on consumers and propagule density experimental areas were tilled and weeded. Consumers were important determinants of restoration success: averaged across propagule density consumers reduced N. pulchra seedling recruitment by nearly 30 PeRcEnT reduced seedling height by 44 PeRcEnT reduced plant establishment by 52 PeRcEnT and reduced reproductive tiller length by 43 PeRcEnT. Small rodents affected seedling establishment especially where seeding density was high but did not affect seedling height. Plots accessible by squirrels and rabbits exhibited significantly decreased seedling height and plant establishment whereas there was no additional impact of allowing large consumers  deer) access. Despite strong spatially variable effects of consumers doubling seed density led to nearly doubled N. pulchra establishment on average. Consumer effects were persistent shaping N. pulchra abundance in the subsequent growing season and remaining evident over 18 months after the experiment was initiated. Our work suggests that despite strong consumer effects seed addition may be a viable strategy for restoration of N. pulchra in invaded areas where it has been displaced by exotic plants especially when combined with restoration strategies that reduce competition with exotic plants. 1909:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The eruptive episode of Mount St. Helens that began on 18 May 1980 created an unprecedented natural laboratory for studying the effects of large disturbances on ecosystems and the processes that affect ecological recovery. Its richness lay not only in its size but also in the complexity of the disturbance (comprising a decapitating landslide the blast pyroclastic and debris flows and volcanic ash depositions) and in the interaction of subsequent eruptive events over space and time. Following the eruption ecologists likened themselves to kids in the candy shop as the complexity and richness of disturbance impacts and ecological responses revealed themselves. Other large disturbance events followed on the heels of Mount St. Helens such as the Yellowstone Fires of 1988 Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Studies of these events expanded and enriched the lessons from Mount St. Helens regarding editing processes legacies and heterogeneity. Important field experiments such as the artificial uprooting of forests in a simulation of hurricanes have followed allowing more careful study of the processes involved in the creation of legacies and their role in ecosystem recovery. As a result ecologists are now actively reassessing theory and concepts related to disturbances and ecosystem recovery. Many of the findings are not really new but rather are both intuitive and evident in various forms in older literature. For example in 1916 Frederic Clements described residuals (surviving organisms) as important elements in succession. In the 1960s scientists at Hubbard Brook demonstrated the importance of residual vegetation in controlling nutrient losses through watershed experiments. But many modern ecological texts and teachers seem to have lost track of such lessons. Mount St. Helens has demonstrated that disturbances are far more complex and heterogeneous than we have been prepared to acknowledge. Sound predictions about subsequent ecosystem recovery require knowledge of the kinds quantities and distribution of biological legacies and the roles that they may play. Understanding successional and ecosystem processes requires as much attention to structure as to composition. We find that our predictive power is very limited. Models based on individual mechanisms such as facilitation inhibition and tolerance can contribute to our understanding of succession but are relevant only to specific locations in the disturbed landscape. Under the complex conditions of real disturbance many processes are operating simultaneously and some are the unpredictable consequences of stochastic events. In this context reductionist approaches and an emphasis on the null hypothesis with its either or outcome can be very misleading. The lessons of Mount St. Helens and modern disturbance ecology have important applications. Natural resource management practices are purportedly modeled on natural disturbances. In fact many favored practices__such as clear cutting in the case of forest harvest__leave little in the way of biological legacies because of the uniformity and frequency of the harvest and the high proportion of organic material that is lost through harvest residue disposal and decomposition. Hence the notion that clear cutting is comparable to a wildfire in its effects including its legacies is unwarranted. The concept of structural legacies (living and dead) is being incorporated into new forest practices sometimes referred to as ecosystem management. For example retention of large trees snags and logs as well as patches of forest on harvested sites is a major element of the Northwest Forest Plan for federal forests. Similar practices are being adopted on forestlands elsewhere in North America South America Australia and Europe including Scandinavia. Does Mount St. Helens have more ecological messages for scientists? Many open questions remain. Will we observe thresholds in the recovery process with rapid and permanent transitions between states such as from open communities to forest dominance? How will eruptive events during the next century affect the recovery process? Creating and maintaining a strong base of long term observations on recovery processes at Mount St. Helens (as well as other disturbances) are the most important actions that we can take to ensure that we learn as much as possible from these events. For after all empirical data provide the only real test of ecological theory. Many predictions were made about the natural ecological responses expected in the gray ash covered moonscape visible immediately after the cataclysmic event assuming no human intervention. According to extant theory recovery__or ecological succession__would begin with the dispersal of plants animals and microbes into the devastated zone from adjacent unaffected areas. Hardy specially adapted pioneer species would lead the way and create conditions that would facilitate the establishment of species characteristic of more advanced stages of succession. Recovery in the 600 km2 area would occur primarily by migration from the edges. Reality defied predictions. Biologists were confounded by the richly varied and often surprising circumstances that not only left organisms alive but also allowed biotic processes and structures to persist. As a result ecosystem recovery proceeded rapidly and by diverse pathways. Excepting only the sites of pyroclastic flows and lava extrusions organisms survived almost everywhere as complete individuals perenating parts (such as rhizomes or roots) seeds and spores. Not all survivors persisted but many did including species representing all trophic levels most life forms and all successional stages__pioneer and late successional. In the soil animals such as pocket gophers and deer mice survived; pocket gophers proved important in mixing old soil with new volcanic ash and disseminating spores of mycorrhizal fungi. Late lying snowbanks melted away to reveal intact beds of tree saplings and shrubs that immediately resumed growth. Amphibians emerged from the sediments of lakes and ponds to reproduce. Organisms did disperse from long distances into the devastated zone and many established themselves. These again included species considered to be pioneers as well as those characteristic of the late successional forest such as Pacific silver fir and western hemlock trees. Site preparation or facilitation by pioneers did occur as with azotobacter hosting lupines on the pumice plain but just as often it did not. Many solitary tree seedlings established on the pyroclastic flows for example. There were immense legacies of organic structures most notably blast flattened tree boles and standing dead trees (snags). Classical ecological theory has largely ignored ecosystem structure__the individual and collective architecture of the components__in favor of composition. Yet structural complexity is a major factor in biological diversity and ecosystem processes. Structural legacies at Mount St. Helens influenced geomorphic processes such as erosion and deposition of sediments. They also provided critical protective cover habitat and food and nutrient sources for a variety of organisms. Re colonization of some species depended on these structures; for example western bluebirds and Oregon juncos require snags and logs respectively for nesting. The devastated zone was spatially heterogeneous reflecting the complex interactions among preeruption conditions disturbance and posteruption processes. This spatial complexity was often evident in the density and diversity of surviving organisms and structures. For example areas occupied by preeruption clear cuts and snowbanks were notable for the abundance of surviving plants. Erosion actually facilitated ecosystem recovery in some locations by removing the fresh ash cover from many buried plants and inhibited recovery on other sites where the eroded materials were deposited. Recovery was most rapid on the numerous sites that either had concentrations of surviving organisms or represented particularly favorable microsites (such as well watered sites) or both. Consequently the pattern of recovery was dominated by nucleation__spreading from thousands of foci__rather than by gradual encroachment from the margins as originally expected. Ecologists at Mount St. Helens came to view disturbances as vast editing processes. Each disturbance event is a process in which some biotic elements (organisms and structures) are deleted (removed) some are transformed (as from live to dead) and others are left unaffected. A new term biological legacies was coined to describe the organisms and organic structures that survive a disturbance event. The fact is disturbances often kill organisms__such as trees or corals__but do not consume or remove much of the structure or its organic matter. Even Mount St. Helens left most of the forest behind.  190:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1938:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fire is a worldwide phenomenon that appears in the geological record soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants. Fire influences global ecosystem patterns and processes including vegetation distribution and structure the carbon cycle and climate. Although humans and fire have always coexisted our capacity to manage fire remains imperfect and may become more difficult in the future as climate change alters fire regimes. This risk is difficult to assess however because fires are still poorly represented in global models. Here we discuss some of the most important issues involved in developing a better understanding of the role of fire in the Earth system. 2054:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Pocket gophers (Geomyidae) and their ecological cognates worldwide have profound impacts on ecosystems from consuming vegetation to altering the soil physically. The rodents excavate vast burrow systems and deposit tailings in abandoned tunnels and on the ground surface. Energetic costs of excavations are extremely high placing a premium on optimizing the location of burrows. The resulting disturbance patterns alter physical and biotic processes fundamentally. Recent studies reveal that the extensive excavations and their associated impacts generate a dynamic mosaic of nutrients and soil conditions that promotes diversity and maintains disturbance dependent components off plant communities. Furthermore these disturbances significantly accelerate erosion and downslope soil movement on shallow slopes and inhibit them on steep slopes. 2075:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecological niche modeling a new methodology for predicting the geographic course of species invasions was tested based on four invasive plant species (garlic mustard sericea lespedeza Russian olive and hydrilla) in North America. Models of ecological niches and geographic distributions on native distributional areas (Europe and Asia) were highly statistically significant. Projections for each species to North America effectively predictions of invasive potential were highly coincident with areas of known invasions. Hence in each case the geographic invasive potential was well summarized in a predictive sense; this methodology holds promise for development of control and eradication strategies and for risk assessment for species invasions. 214:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,224:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological invasions are a leading threat to freshwater biodiversity worldwide. A central unanswered question of invasion ecology is why some introduced populations establish while most fail. Answering this question will allow resource managers to increase the specificity and effectiveness of control efforts and policy. We studied the establishment of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) in the United States and Canada by modeling introduction failure caused by demographic stochasticity environmental variation and seasonal environmental forcing. We compared predicted establishment rates with observed invasions of inland lakes in Ontario Canada. Our findings suggest that environmental forcing can cause   windows   of invasion opportunity so that timing of introductions might be a greater determinant of population establishment than demographic stochasticity and random environmental variation. We expect this phenomenon to be exhibited by species representing a wide range of life histories. For spiny water flea in North America a large window of invasion opportunity opens around the fourth week of May persists through the summer and closes with decreasing water temperatures in autumn. These results show how timing of introductions with respect to seasonally forced environmental drivers can be a key determinant of establishment success. By focusing on introductions during windows of invasion opportunity resource managers can more effectively control invasion rates. 225:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Colonization is of longstanding interest in theoretical ecology and biogeography and in the management of weeds and other invasive species including insect pests and emerging infectious diseases. Due to accelerating invasion rates and widespread economic costs and environmental damages caused by invasive species colonization theory has lately become a matter of considerable interest. Here we review the concept of propagule pressure to inquire if colonization theory might provide quantitative tools for risk assessment of biological invasions. By formalizing the concept of propagule pressure in terms of stochastic differential equation models of population growth we seek a synthesis of invasion biology and theoretical population biology. We focus on two components of propagule pressure that affect the chance of invasion: (1) the number of individuals initially introduced and (2) the rate of subsequent immigration. We also examine how Allee effects which are expected to be common in newly introduced populations may inhibit establishment of introduced propagules. We find that the establishment curve  the chance of invasion as a function of initial population size) can take a variety of shapes depending on immigration rate carrying capacity and the severity of Allee effects. Additionally Allee effects can cause the stationary distribution of population sizes to be bimodal which we suggest is a possible explanation for time lags commonly observed between the detection of an introduced population and widespread invasion of the landscape. 226:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the substantial impacts of nonindigenous plant pests and weeds relatively little is known about the pathways by which these organisms arrive in the U.S. One source of such information is the Port Information Network (PIN) database maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) since 1984. The PIN database is comprised of records of pests intercepted by APHIS personnel during inspections of travelers baggage cargo conveyances and related items arriving at U.S. ports of entry and border crossings. Each record typically includes the taxonomic identify of the pest its country of origin and information related to the commodity and interception site. We summarized more than 725 000 pest interceptions recorded in PIN from 1984 to 2000 to examine origins interception sites and modes of transport for nonindigenous insects mites mollusks nematodes plant pathogens and weeds. Roughly 62 PeRcEnT of intercepted pests were associated with baggage 30 PeRcEnT were associated with cargo and 7 PeRcEnT were associated with plant propagative material. Pest interceptions occurred most commonly at airports (73 PeRcEnT) U.S. Mexico land border crossings (13 PeRcEnT) and marine ports (9 PeRcEnT). Insects dominated the database comprising 73 to 84 PeRcEnT of the records annually with the orders Homoptera Lepidoptera and Diptera collectively accounting for over 75 PeRcEnT of the insect records. Plant pathogens weeds and mollusks accounted for 13 7 and 1.5 PeRcEnT of all pest records respectively while mites and nematodes comprised less than 1 PeRcEnT of the records. Pests were intercepted from at least 259 different locations. Common origins included Mexico Central and South American countries the Caribbean and Asia. Within specific commodity pathways richness of the pest taxa generally increased linearly with the number of interceptions. Application of PIN data for statistically robust predictions is limited by nonrandom sampling protocols but the data provide a valuable historical record of the array of nonindigenous organisms transported to the U.S. through international trade and travel. 227:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Introductions of invasive nonindigenous species and the ensuing negative ecological and economic consequences have increased with expanding global trade. Quantifying the influx of nonindigenous plant pest species through foreign trade is required for national and international risk assessments monitoring and conservation efforts and evaluation of ecological factors that affect invasion success. Here we use statistically robust data collected at US ports of entry and border crossings to estimate arrival rates of nonindigenous insect species via four cargo pathways and to evaluate the effectiveness of current efforts to monitor arrival of nonindigenous insect species. Interception rates were highest in refrigerated maritime cargo where a new insect species was intercepted on average every 54 inspections. Projected estimates of insect species richness stabilized only for non refrigerated maritime cargo and US Mexico border cargo where inspectors likely detected 19 2 PeRcEnT and 30 50 PeRcEnT of the species being transported through these respective pathways. Conservative estimates of establishment suggest that 42 insect species may have become established through these four pathways between 1997 and 2001. 228:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,234:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Average inoculum size and number of introductions are known to have positive effects on population persistence. However whether these factors affect persistence independently or interact is unknown. We conducted a two factor experiment in which 112 populations of parthenogenetic Daphnia magna were maintained for 41 days to study effects of inoculum size and introduction frequency on: (i) population growth (ii) population persistence and (iii) time to extinction. We found that the interaction of inoculum size and introduction frequency the immigration rate affected all three dependent variables while population growth was additionally affected by introduction frequency. We conclude that for this system the most important aspect of propagule pressure is immigration rate with relatively minor additional effects of introduction frequency and negligible effects of inoculum size. 247:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Holeck and colleagues rightly draw attention to transoceanic ships as a source of nonindigenous species (NIS) in the North American Great Lakes. We agree that management strategies aimed at preventing new invasions must consider the linkages between NIS and vectors and that invasive species from anthropogenic sources will be a growing problem as global trade increases. We are concerned however that the inference that midocean ballast water exchange (BWE) has been ineffective is incorrect and might mislead further policy development. At issue is their plot of the cumulative number of recorded NIS against the year of their discovery from 1955 to 2000. This interval is divided into two periods: before a voluntary policy of BWE was instituted in 1989 and afterward. Linear regressions were fit to the data in each period independently so that the estimated slopes represent the pre and post 1989 discovery rates respectively. On the basis of these results the authors report that the annual rate from 1989 to 2000 was more than double that observed between 1959 and 1988 from which they conclude that transoceanic shipping remains the largest source of NIS in the Great Lakes. We believe the authors intend to imply that BWE has been ineffective or is possibly even related to an increase in the rate of invasion. The authors acknowledge that investigation bias and time lags between species establishment and discovery obscure the true rate of species invasion. However they do not acknowledge that these biases alone could be sufficient to cause the rate of discoveries to increase even when the introduction rate is constant or zero. Statistical methods are available for estimating and correcting these biases but the authors did not report such an analysis. Moreover even under the assumption that there is no lag between introduction and discovery the conclusion that BWE is associated with accelerated introductions is not supported. Visual inspection of the discovery record suggests that if there is a break point separating two periods that differ in discovery rate it predates the 1989 policy. Using break point regression we confirmed that the true division is the year 1982 (__ 0.955 standard error) well before the institution of BWE. Indeed this date even precedes the discovery of zebra mussels__the immediate impetus for the recent increase in research on aquatic species invasions__ which suggests that it is unlikely that this acceleration of discoveries is the result of investigation bias. Using the statistically determined break point we estimated that the discovery rate after 1982 was 0.92 per year (__ 0.065 95 percent confidence interval) approximately triple the rate during the period before 1982 which was 0.31 per year (__ 0.069). This break point model explains the vast majority of the variation in cumulative discoveries (adjusted R2 equals 0.9902). Thus we infer that the discovery rate (though not necessarily the introduction rate) of invasive species has probably accelerated but that this is most likely unrelated to BWE. 25:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Herbivores can affect the composition of grassland communities. We examined seedling herbivory by the introduced snail Helix aspersa on four grass species common in California grasslands. To assess preference standardized tests using equal amounts of seedlings Of the same age were conducted in addition to tests in which live seedlings were exposed to snail herbivory. Helix aspersa exhibited the greatest preference for native Bromus carinatus while native Nassella pulchra and exotic B. hordeaceus were moderately preferred. Exotic Avena fatua was least preferred. Assessment Of preference using both standardized and live Seedling trials yielded consistent results suggesting that preference is due to variation in seedling quality rather than differences in per seedling biomass that are likely to exist under field conditions. Avena fatua is very common in California grasslands while B. carinatus is relatively rare. Our results Suggest that the high level of snail preference for B. carinatus and aversion to A. fatua coupled with severe effects on future growth due to complete defoliation of live seedlings may reinforce patterns of establishment of these grasses observed in natural communities. 264:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Answering large scale questions in ecology can involve time consuming data compilation. We show how networks of undergraduate classes can make these projects more manageable and provide an authentic research experience for students. With this approach we examined the factors associated with plant species richness in US national wildlife refuges. We found that the richness of harmful invasive plants and the richness of native plants were positively correlated in mainland refuges but negatively correlated in island refuges. Nonnative richness and invasive richness were also positively correlated with colonization pressure as indicated by nonnative richness around each refuge. Associations between refuge characteristics and invasive plants varied substantially among regions with refuge area and habitat diversity important predictors of invasion in some regions but not in others. Our results serve to identify the refuges that are most susceptible to plant invasion and demonstrate the potential value of a new model for education and research integration. 26:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Introductions of non indigenous species in ballast water are one of the greatest threats to freshwater and marine ecosystems worldwide. New approaches to reducing the release of organisms from ballast water are under consideration nationally and internationally. Unfortunately the development of scientifically defensible policy for controlling introductions from ballast water has been retarded by the lack of relevant ecological theory and a shortage of information about the identity and numbers of organisms in ballast. Here we present a novel quantitative approach to estimating the risk of species establishment by combining a model for population spread with known allometric correlations between body size and population growth rate for broad taxonomic categories. Our approach is applicable to sexually reproducing planktonic taxonomic groups including ctenophores cnidaria arthropods annelids mollusks and (as an approximation) echinoderms and fishes. As expected the allowable volume of ballast discharge depends strongly on the acceptable level of risk (which is a societal decision) the taxonomic group of concern and the characteristics of the receiving environment. For example for a risk tolerance equivalent to establishment of one in one hundred introduced species independent releases of untreated ballast water should not exceed around 50 000 metric tons. Because of differences in horizontal mixing in different environments releases in harbors are more risky than releases in open water. These results provide quantitative guidelines that could immediately lower the risk of species invasion while other more permanent technological solutions are developed. 274:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Nonindigenous forest insects and pathogens affect a range of ecosystems industries and property owners in the United States Evaluating temporal patterns in the accumulation of these nonindigenous forest pests can inform regulatory and policy decisions We compiled a comprehensive species list to assess the accumulation rates of nonindigenous forest insects and pathogens established in the United States More than 450 nonindigenous insects and at least 16 pathogens have colonized forest and urban trees since European settlement Approximately 25 established nonindigenous forest insects per year were detected in the United States between 1860 and 2006 At least 14 PeRcEnT of these insects and all 16 pathogens have caused notable damage to trees Although sap feeders and foliage feeders dominated the comprehensive list phloem and wood boring insects and foliage feeders were often more damaging than expected Detections of insects that feed on phloem or wood have increased markedly in recent years 27:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Management and control of biological invasions and emerging infectious diseases are leading topics of research in theoretical and applied ecology. When the initial number of potentially invasive or infectious individuals is small demographic stochasticity can lead to rapid extinction Suggesting that the transient dynamics of establishment for invasive species and epidemics should be modeled as a stochastic process. Quantitative risk assessment can exploit this conceptualization to calculate risk metrics such as the chance of invasion or epidemic and to study the potential effectiveness of rapid response interventions. Here I review some simple establishment models and demonstrate how understanding the underlying stochastic processes can lead to more effective policies for risk management. As examples I study the dynamics of feral nutria (Myocastor coypus) in East Anglia UK and infection by bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) in various species. Nutria are fur bearing aquatic mammals that have been introduced around the world intentionally and through escape front farms and cause severe damage to marsh vegetation. Bovine tubers culosis is a chronic wasting disease of diverse mammal species and results in long term emaciation and decline in animal fitness. I find that both nutria and bovine tuberculosis exhibit high intrinsic rates of increase as measured by their increase in abundance when the may affect the chance of establishment population or epidemic is small. While Allee effects for nutria analysis of additional data will be required to reject the hypothesis that nutria dynamics follow the simple Ricker growth model. The distinction is important however as the estimated chance of establishment under the Allee effect model is considerably less than under the Ricker model for introduced populations less than about 850 individuals. The chance of bovine tuberculosis epidemic for introductions of small numbers of individuals infectious with bovine tuberculosis in populations of brush tail possums (Trichosarus vulpecula) or badgers (Meles meles) is high. Thus if surveillance programs are not almost completely effective at preventing introductions of infectious individuals periodic outbreaks are likely to Occur. Epidemics in these species might be controlled by culling. 284:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The range expansion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in North America has been rapid and costly in both economic and ecological terms. joint social political and scientific ventures such as the 100th Meridian Initiative aim to reduce the spread of zebra mussels by eliminating the unintended transport of the species and preventing its westward expansion. Here we forecast the potential distribution of zebra mussels in the United States by applying a machine learning algorithm for nonparametric prediction of species distributions (genetic algorithm for rule set production or GARP) to data about the current distribution of zebra mussels in the United States and 11 environmental and geological covariates. Our results suggest that much of the American West will be uninhabitable for zebra mussels. Nonetheless some catchments along the West Coast and in the southeastern United States exhibit considerable risk of invasion and should be monitored carefully. Possible propagule dispersal to these places should be managed proactively. 28:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The potential for ecological and economic damage caused by invasive species is only beginning to be appreciated. A recently arrived and particularly worrisome invader in North America is the Asian longhorned beetle Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) the larvae of which damage trees and forests. The geographic extent and likely path of its possible invasion of North American forests however are unknown. Herein we develop and test ecological niche models for the species based on features of climate from the species native distribution in eastern Asia and then project them onto North America to identify areas of potential distribution. These models suggest that the species has the potential to invade much of eastern North America but only limited areas in western North America and that a focus of initiation of invasions is likely to lie in the area south of the Great Lakes. This result is particularly clear under modeled scenarios of spread and contagion. 317:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, With Reid and Hudson we lament the weak representation of taxonomic expertise in modern biology. In fact we have advocated increased funding for research in systematics and programs for training taxonomists. We are cognizant of our own lack of expertise in taxonomy and how the lack of taxonomic information and expertise hinders progress in research and management of biological invasions. Nevertheless taxonomic expertise does not explain the differences between the conclusions of our papers and the conclusions Reid and Hudson think we ought to have drawn. Rather their disagreement is with our conceptual framework for thinking about invasive species and the uncertainties concerning species that might establish in regions outside their native ranges. Specifically they assess invasion potential differently than we did. That is to categorize species that have not invaded the Great Lakes and for which a paucity of distributional and ecological information exists we adopted different conceptual criteria than Reid and Hudson to designate these species as indigenous or nonindigenous. In addition for species that have not invaded the Great Lakes it is impossible to say if they might become established if they were to be introduced leaving room for informed judgments and improvement of those judgments as new information becomes available. 322:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,338:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,341:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,345:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,347:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We report results from a study of species in ballast tanks of ships entering the Great Lakes between 2000 and 2002. We collected 1349 individuals from at least 93 unique taxonomic groups of which approximately half were identified to species. We estimated that the zooplankton assemblage in ballast water destined for the Great Lakes comprised from 200 to 1000 unique taxa consisting of both freshwater and marine species. Between 14 and 39 of these taxa have not yet been recorded from the Great Lakes. Further 13.9 PeRcEnT of individual specimens identified to the species level were from species not previously collected from the Great Lakes. We collected seven nonindigenous freshwater species not currently found in the Great Lakes: Brachionus plicatilis Cyclocypria kinkaidia Maraenobiotus insignipes Microcyclops rubellus Microcyclops varicans Neomysis awatchensis and Paracyclops chiltoni. We found no evidence that ship age seasonal timing or age of ballast water affected the abundance of individuals or species in the ballast tanks. To our knowledge these are the first extrapolations of data from ballast water collections to estimate the rate of species introduction to any ecosystem. 361:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Collisions between ships and whales are an increasing concern for endangered large whale species. After an unusually high number of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) were fatally struck in 2007 off the coast of southern California federal agencies implemented a voluntary conservation program to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes in the region. This initiative involved seasonal advisory broadcasts requesting vessel operators to voluntarily slow to 10 knots or less when transiting a 75 nm stretch of designated shipping lanes. We monitored ship adherence with those speed advisories using Automatic Identification System data. Daily average speed of cargo and tanker ships and the average speed of individual ship transits before during and after the notices were statistically analyzed for changes related to the notices. Whereas a small number of individual ships (1 PeRcEnT) traveled significantly slower during the requested periods speeds were not at or below the recommended 10 knots nor were daily average speeds reduced during the notices. Voluntary conservation measures are established in a variety of contexts and may be preferable to regulatory action; in this case a request to make voluntary changes appeared largely ineffective. Reducing collision risks for whales in this area will require consideration of the various factors that likely explain the lack of adherence when developing an alternative strategy. 363:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,418:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The most efficient way to reduce future damages from nonindigenous species is to prevent the introduction of harmful species. Although ecologists have long sought to predict the identity of such species recent methodological advances promise success where previous attempts failed. We applied recently developed risk assessment approaches to nonindigenous freshwater molluscs at two geographic scales: the Laurentian Great Lakes basin and the 48 contiguous states of the United States. We used data on natural history and biogeography to discriminate between established freshwater molluscs that are benign and those that constitute nuisances  cause environmental and or economic damage). Two statistical techniques logistic regression and categorical tree analysis showed that nuisance status was positively associated with fecundity. Other aspects of natural history and biogeography did not significantly affect likelihood of becoming a nuisance. We then used the derived statistical models to predict the chance that 15 mollusc species not yet in natural ecosystems would cause damage if they become established. We also tested whether time since establishment is related to the likelihood that nonindigenous mollusc species in the Great Lakes and United States would cause negative impacts. No significant relationship was evident at the US. scale but recently established molluscs within the Great Lakes were more likely to cause negative impacts. This may reflect changing environmental conditions changing patterns of trade or may be an indication of   invasional meltdown.   Our quantitative analyses could be extended to other taxa and ecosystems and offer a number of improvements over the qualitative risk assessments currently used by US. (and other) government agencies. 429:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We used historical data to parameterize species accumulation models relating international trade to the establishment rates of nonindigenous species in the United States over the past century. We then coupled these relationships with published trade forecasts to predict future invasion rates for insects plant pathogens and mollusks. Relationships between the accumulation of non native species and merchandise imports were reasonably described by log log and log linear species area models and Michaelis Menten accumulation functions. However the latter two models produced markedly better fits. When coupled with projected trade forecasts the log linear species area model predicted 16 24 PeRcEnT taxon specific increases in the number of nonindigenous species established in the United States from 2000 to 2020. The Michaelis Menten model predicted much lower 3 6 PeRcEnT increases but even this meant 115 new insect species and 5 new plant pathogens. These results suggest that the ecological and economic costs associated with human caused biological invasions may continue to rise substantially over the coming decades. 447:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,454:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,477:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Geographical variation in numbers of established non native species provides clues to the underlying processes driving biological invasions. Specifically this variation reflects landscape characteristics that drive non native species arrival establishment and spread. Here we investigate spatial variation in damaging non native forest insect and pathogen species to draw inferences about the dominant processes influencing their arrival establishment and spread. The continental USA including Alaska (Hawaii not included). We assembled the current geographical ranges (county level) of 79 species of damaging non indigenous forest insect and pathogen species currently established in the continental USA. We explored statistical associations of numbers of species per county with habitat characteristics associated with propagule pressure and with variables reflecting habitat invasibility. We also analysed relationships between the geographical area occupied by each pest species and the time since introduction and habitat characteristics. The geographical pattern of non native forest pest species richness is highly focused with vastly more species in the north eastern USA. Geographical variation in species richness is associated with habitat factors related to both propagule pressure and invasibility. Ranges of the non native species are related to historical spread; range areas are strongly correlated with time since establishment. The average (all species) radial rate of range expansion is 5.2 km yr( 1) and surprisingly this rate did not differ among foliage feeders sap feeders wood borers and plant pathogens. Forest pest species are much more concentrated in the north eastern region of the USA compared with other parts of the country. This pattern most likely reflects the combined effects of propagule pressure (pest arrival) habitat invasibility (pest establishment) and invasion spread. The similarity in historical spread among different types of organisms indicates the importance of anthropogenic movement in spread. 480:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, To determine why some communities are more invasible than others and how this depends on spatial scale. Our previous work in serpentine ecosystems showed that native and exotic diversity are negatively correlated at small scales but became positively correlated at larger scales. We hypothesized that this pattern was the result of classic niche partitioning at small scales where the environment is homogeneous and a shift to the dominance of coexistence mechanisms that depend on spatial heterogeneity in the environment at large scales. Serpentine ecosystem Northern California. We test the above hypotheses using the phylogenetic relatedness of natives and exotics. We hypothesized that (1) at small scales native and exotic species should be more distantly related than expected from a random assemblage model because with biotic resistance successful invaders should have niches that are different from those of the natives present and (2) at large scales native and exotic species should not be more distantly related than expected. Result We find strong support for the first hypothesis providing further evidence of biotic resistance at small scales. However at large scales native and exotic species were also more distantly related than expected. Importantly however natives and exotics were more distantly related at small scales than they were at large scales suggesting that in the transition from small to large scales biotic resistance is relaxed but still present. Communities at large scales were not saturated in the sense that more species could enter the community increasing species richness. However species did not invade indiscriminately. Exotic species closely related to species already established the community were excluded. Native communities determine the identity of exotic invaders even at large spatial scales where communities are unsaturated. These results hold promise for predicting which species will invade a community given the species present. 490:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,491:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Because of the damage some do including threatening biodiversity invasive species are a current focus of interest particularly outside Europe. Yet invasion biology is still struggling to become analytic. Progress has been made in quantifying the proportion of invaders that succeed in various ways and in measuring the degree of that success. Several examples where the course of invasion has been explained show the variation in biological processes involved. A detailed analysis often with experiments and modelling is necessary for a satisfactory explanation. Prediction is harder than explanation. Attempts at predicting invasions have generally been unsatisfactory. Ten reasons that may contribute to this are discussed. Progress will require defining more precisely what is to be predicted and measuring more quantitatively the ecological properties of species. Even so predicting the ecological behaviour of a species in a new environment may be effectively impossible. 497:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,505:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A major problem in insect pest and weed management is uncertainty. Managers are faced with three main types of uncertainty: uncertainty about biological and environmental processes and observational uncertainty. Active adaptive management (AAM) is management with a deliberate plan for learning about the managed system so that management can be improved in the face of uncertainty. We discuss the potential benefits of applying AAM to insect pest and weed control with reference to a number of examples. We first address the possible uses for AAM in biological control with particular reference to agent selection and release. We also propose applying AAM methods to resistance management and to spatial strategies for pest control. We conclude with an overview of AAM a discussion of some of the potential limitations to its use in pest management and the possibilities for increased implementation of AAM in the future. 526:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,530:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Improvements in environmental policy require an accurate diagnosis of the shortcomings of existing policy. We develop a model for assessing the efficacy of policy instruments aimed at reducing the introduction of nonindigenous species. The model identifies and accounts for several features of the nonindigenous species introduction detection process that complicate interpretations of monitoring data. Specifically the model includes explicit attention to the pathway of introduction a probabilistic description of species detection and the possibility of attenuation of species introductions over time. We apply this theoretical model to the case of mid ocean ballast water exchange which was implemented by the United States in 1990 for the North American Great Lakes. Contrary to other authors who take the recent increase in discoveries of nonindigeneous species (NIS) in the Great Lakes as evidence that ballast water exchange is ineffective we find that the observed detection record could just as plausibly be explained by a lag of a few years between introduction and detection even if ballast water exchange was 100 PeRcEnT effective. Model results suggest that under current monitoring regimes several more years of data would be required to make a conclusive evaluation of ballast water exchange. Better estimation of the lag time between introduction and detection and a shortening of that lag time with better monitoring would allow more precise and timely evaluation of the efficacy of ballast water exchange and other policy instruments. 534:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Invasion by exotic species is a major threat to global diversity. The invasion of native perennial grasslands in California by annual species from the southern Mediterranean region is one of the most dramatic invasions worldwide. As a result of this invasion native species are often restricted to low fertility marginal habitat. An understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the recolonization of the more fertile sites by native species is critical to determining the prospects for conservation and restoration of the native flora. We present the results of a five year experiment in which we used seeding burning and mowing treatments to investigate the mechanisms that constrain native annuals to the marginal habitat of a Californian serpentine grassland. The abundance and richness of native species declined with increasing soil fertility and there was no effect of burning or mowing on native abundance or richness in the absence of seeding. We found that native annual forbs were strongly seed limited; a single seeding increased abundance of native forbs even in the presence of high densities of exotic species and this effect was generally discernable after four years. These results suggest that current levels of dominance by exotic species are not simply the result of direct competitive interactions and that seeding of native species is necessary and may be sufficient to create viable populations of native annual species in areas that are currently dominated by exotic species. 535:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Invasive species are one of the fastest growing conservation problems. These species homogenize the worlds flora and fauna threaten rare and endemic species and impose large economic costs. Here we examine the distribution of 834 of the more than 1000 exotic plant taxa that have become established in Califoriiia USA. Total species richness increases with net primary productivity; however the exotic flora is richest in low lying coastal sites that harbor large numbers of imperiled species; while native diversity is highest in areas with high mean elevation. Weedy and invasive exotics are more tightly linked to the distribution of imperiled species than the overall pool of exotic species. Structural equation modeling suggests that while human activities such as urbanization and agriculture facilitate the initial invasion by exotic plants exotics spread ahead of the front of human development into areas with high numbers of threatened native plants. The range sizes of exotic taxa are an order of magnitude smaller than for comparable native taxa. The current small range size of exotic species implies that California has a significant   invasion debt   that will be paid as exotic plants expand their range and spread throughout the state. 560:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,580:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, When viewed across long temporal and large spatial scales severe disturbances in marine ecosystems are not uncommon. Events such as hurricanes oil spills disease outbreaks hypoxic events harmful algal blooms and coral bleaching can cause massive mortality and dramatic habitat effects on local or even regional scales. Although designers of marine reserves might assume low risk from such events over the short term catastrophes are quite probable over the long term and must be considered for successful implementation of reserves. A simple way to increase performance of a reserve network is to incorporate into the reserve design a mechanism for calculating how much additional area would be required to buffer the reserve against effects of catastrophes. In this paper we develop a method to determine this   insurance factor  : a multiplier to calculate the additional reserve area necessary to ensure that functional goals of reserves will be met within a given   catastrophe regime.   We document and analyze the characteristics of two relatively well studied types of disturbances: oil spills and hurricanes. We examine historical data to characterize catastrophe regimes within. which reserves must function and use these regimes to illustrate the application of the insurance factor. This tool can be applied to any reserve design for which goals are defined by a quantifiable measure such as a fraction of shoreline that is necessary to accomplish a particular function. In the absence of such quantitative measures the concept of additional area as insurance against catastrophes may still be useful. 591:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) a phloem feeding beetle native to Asia was discovered near Detroit Michigan and Windsor Ontario in 2002. As of March 2009 isolated populations of emerald ash borer (EAB) have been detected in nine additional states and Quebec. EAB is a highly invasive forest pest that has the potential to spread and kill native ash trees (Fraxinus sp.) throughout the United States. We estimate the discounted cost of ash treatment removal and replacement on developed land within communities in a 25 state study area centered on Detroit using simulations of EAB spread and infestation over the next decade (2009 2019). An estimated 38 million ash trees occur on this land base. The simulations predict an expanding EAB infestation that will likely encompass most of the 25 states and warrant treatment. removal and replacement of more than 17 million ash trees with mean discounted cost of  DoLlQuAnT 10.7 billion. Expanding the land base to include developed land outside as well as inside communities nearly double the estimates of the number of ash trees treated or removed and replaced and the associated cost. The estimates of discounted cost suggest that a substantial investment might be efficiently spent to slow the expansion of isolated EAB infestations and postpone the ultimate costs of ash treatment removal and replacement. 614:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,614:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Classical models of biological invasions generally assume that introductions consist of single releases of organisms whereas in nature successful invasions are usually the result of repeated immigration events. A straightforward consequence of such repeated events is that they are likely to increase invasion success. In this article we consider a less obvious consequence namely how repeated immigration events interact with the spatial dispersion of immigration. We construct a spatially explicit model that includes Allee effects and population diffusion so that repeated introductions must be concentrated in order for the population to exceed the Allee threshold over a critical minimum area and successfully invade. We use this model to show that the spatial dispersion of immigration events is of key importance in determining invasion success. Specifically invasion risks decline when immigration events are dispersed more widely. Because of this effect immigration events that occur close to habitat boundaries are likely to lead to higher invasion risks as dispersing organisms are forced back towards the source of immigrants. These results have important implications for efforts to reduce the risk of aquatic invasions due to discharges of ballast water by commercial ships. When ballast discharge occurs either far from port and thus far from habitat boundaries or far from other ballast discharge events and thus with wider dispersion then invasion risks should be greatly reduced. Our work demonstrates the importance of spatial structure for understanding ecological problems and shows how mathematical models can be useful in guiding environmental management. 622:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,62:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,632:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,638:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,653:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A central question in ecology concerns how some exotic plants that occur at low densities in their native range are able to attain much higher densities where. they are introduced. This question has remained unresolved in part due to a lack of experiments that assess factors that affect the population growth or abundance of plants in both ranges. We tested two hypotheses for exotic plant success: escape from specialist insect herbivores and a greater response to disturbance in the introduced range. Within three introduced populations in Montana USA and three native populations in Germany we experimentally manipulated insect herbivore pressure and created small scale disturbances to determine how these factors affect the performance of houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale) a widespread exotic in western North America. Herbivores reduced plant size and fecundity in the native range but had little effect on plant performance in the introduced range. Small scale experimental disturbances enhanced seedling recruitment in both ranges but subsequent seedling survival was more positively affected by disturbance in the introduced range. We combined these experimental results with demographic data from each population to parameterize integral projection population models to assess how enemy escape and disturbance might differentially influence C. officinale in each range. Model results suggest that escape from specialist insects would lead to only slight increases in the growth rate (lambda) of introduced populations. In contrast the larger response to disturbance in the introduced vs. native range had much greater positive effects on lambda. These results together suggest that at least in the regions where the experiments were performed the differences in response to small disturbances by C. officinale contribute more to higher abundance in the introduced range compared to at home. Despite the challenges of conducting experiments on a wide biogeographic scale and the logistical constraints of adequately sampling populations within a range this approach is a critical step forward to understanding the success of exotic plants. 671:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Biological invasions can change ecosystem function have tremendous economic costs and impact human health; understanding the forces that cause and maintain biological invasions is thus of immediate importance. A mechanism by which exotic plants might displace native plants is by increasing the pressure of native consumers on native plants a form of indirect interaction termed apparent competition. Using experimental exclosures seed addition and monitoring of small mammals in a California grassland we examined whether exotic Brassica nigra increases the pressure of native consumers on a native bunchgrass Nassella pulchra. Experimental plots were weeded to focus entirely on indirect effects via consumers. We demonstrate that B. nigra alters the activity of native small mammal consumers creating a gradient of consumption that dramatically reduces N. pulchra establishment. Previous work has shown that N. pulchra is a strong competitor but that it is heavily seed limited. By demonstrating that consumer pressure is sufficient to curtail establishment our work provides a mechanism for this seed limitation and suggests that despite being a good competitor N. pulchra cannot reestablish close to B. nigra within its old habitats because exotic mediated consumption preempts direct competitive exclusion. Moreover we find that apparent competition has a spatial extent suggesting that consumers may dictate the rate of invasion and the area available for restoration and that nonspatial studies of apparent competition may miss important dynamics. 679:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Consumer plant interactions can alter the outcome of biological invasions when native and exotic plants differ systematically in their resistance to and or tolerance of consumer impacts. Given evidence for indirect interactions and shifts in plant communities from the few existing long term studies it is clear that long term studies are a critical component for understanding the role of consumers in plant invasions. Moreover studies of the role of consumers in mediating invasions have focused on the effects of exotic consumers while the effects of native consumers on invasion have received little attention. Here we examine the long term impact of a largely native vertebrate consumer community on native and exotic understory plants and recruitment of native oaks in a California oak savanna. We sampled plant community composition oak recruitment and soils inside and outside of 10 exclosures (mean area 1000 m(2)) that had been in place for an average of 32 years. Plots with consumers present had 41 PeRcEnT more exotic species 31 PeRcEnT higher cover of exotic species and 33 PeRcEnT lower richness of native herbaceous perennials suggesting that native consumers may play an important role in mediating invasion in this system. The presence of oak canopies had a strong impact on the plant community independent of consumer effects with greater recruitment of oaks higher cover of native shrubs and lower cover of exotic species cover under oak canopies. The concordant variation of native tree canopy and native woody plants suggests that adult oaks provide a refuge for their seedlings and other native woody plants. Thus the widespread loss of native oaks has likely increased exotic invasion into an important refuge for native species in the California oak savanna ecosystem. 698:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fire is a globally distributed disturbance that impacts terrestrial ecosystems and has been proposed to be a global   herbivore. Fire like herbivory is a top down driver that converts organic materials into inorganic products alters community structure and acts as an evolutionary agent. Though grazing and fire may have some comparable effects in grasslands they do not have similar impacts on species composition and community structure. However the concept of fire as a global herbivore implies that fire and herbivory may have similar effects on plant functional traits. Using 22 years of data from a mesic native tallgrass prairie with a long evolutionary history of fire and grazing we tested if trait composition between grazed and burned grassland communities would converge and if the degree of convergence depended on fire frequency. Additionally we tested if eliminating fire from frequently burned grasslands would result in a state similar to unburned grasslands and if adding fire into a previously unburned grassland would cause composition to become more similar to that of frequently burned grasslands. We found that grazing and burning once every four years showed the most convergence in traits suggesting that these communities operate under similar deterministic assembly rules and that fire and herbivory are similar disturbances to grasslands at the trait group level of organization. Three years after reversal of the fire treatment we found that fire reversal had different effects depending on treatment. The formerly unburned community that was then burned annually became more similar to the annually burned community in trait composition suggesting that function may be rapidly restored if fire is reintroduced. Conversely after fire was removed from the annually burned community trait composition developed along a unique trajectory indicating hysteresis or a time lag for structure and function to return following a change in this disturbance regime. We conclude that functional traits and species based metrics should be considered when determining and evaluating goals for fire management in mesic grassland ecosystems. 753:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Tasty plants can be protected from herbivores by unpalatable neighbors. We used experimental exclosures removal of unpalatable species and transplants of palatable and unpalatable species in subalpine meadows of the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia to study the effects of two unpalatable species on plant communities. We found that Cirsium obalatum and Veratrum lobelianum two large native perennial herbs that invade after heavy grazing had strong facilitative effects on communities through their indirect effects on livestock herbivores. These unpalatable invaders had different effects on community composition when livestock were present than when livestock were excluded. Furthermore removing Cirsium and Veratrum where herbivory was permitted decreased the richness of associated communities but inside a livestock exclosure removal of these species increased community richness. Transplanted palatable species (Anthoxanthum odoratum and Phleum alpinum) grew larger inside the exclosure and in the exclosure Cirsium and Veratrunt had no effect on their growth. However outside of the exclosure Cirsium and Veratrum had strong positive effects on the growth of A. odoratum and P. alpinum. Excluding livestock decreased the growth of Luzula pseudosudetica another unpalatable species and Cirsium and Veratrunt had no effect on L. pseudosudetica outside the exclosure. In contrast inside exclosures Cirsium and Veratrum had competitive effects on L. pseudosudetica. Our results indicate that Cirsium and Veratrum which are in some ways undesirable rangeland weeds may also play an important role in maintaining species and functional diversity of overgrazed plant communities in the Caucasus. 759:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The diversity and composition of a community are determined by a combination of local and regional processes. We conducted a field experiment to examine the impact of resource manipulations and seed addition on the invasibility and diversity of a low productivity grassland. We manipulated resource levels both by a disturbance treatment that reduced adult plant cover in the spring of the first year and by addition of fertilizer every year. Seeds of 46 native species both resident and nonresident to the community were added in spring of the first year to determine the effects of recruitment limitation from local (seed limitation) and regional (dispersal limitation) sources on local species richness. Our results show that the unmanipulated community was not readily invasible. Seed addition increased the species richness of unmanipulated plots but this was primarily due to increased occurrence of resident species. Nonresident species were only able to invade following a cover reduction disturbance. Cover reduction resulted in an increase in nitrogen availability in the first year but had no measurable effect on light availability in any year. In contrast fertilization created a persistent increase in nitrogen availability that increased plant cover or biomass and reduced light penetration to ground level. Initially fertilization had an overall positive effect on species richness but by the third year the effect was either negative or neutral. Unlike cover reduction fertilization had no observable effect on seedling recruitment or occurrence (number of plots) of invading resident or nonresident species. The results of our experiment demonstrate that although resource fluctuations can increase the invasibility of this grassland the community response depends on the nature of the resource change. 75:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,762:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The nonnative mudsnail Batillaria attramentaria was introduced to the west coast of North America in the early part of this century and has been displacing the native mudsnail Cerithidea californica on a marsh by marsh basis. We combined detailed quantitative field data on this invader and its interactions with the native snail in an individual based model that allowed us to address both general questions about the mechanism of displacement of native species and more specific concerns about detecting the trajectory and impact of the invasion. In empirically parameterized simulations the native snail was driven extinct within 55 70 yr after introduction of Batillaria which closely matches direct field estimates. We then tested the relative importance of Batillarias demonstrated advantages in parasitism resistance (top down effect) exploitative competition (bottom up effect) and mortality rate (demographic advantage) in driving its displacement of Cerithidea. With its demographic advantage maintained but without its advantages in competition and parasitism Batillaria still drove Cerithidea extinct within 90 yr. Only when Batillarias mortality rate was set equal to that of Cerithidea could the native snail persist indefinitely demonstrating this factors overwhelming influence on the success of this invasion. The difference in mortality between the species was large relative to the other differences but further simulations showed that the importance of this difference stems not just from its magnitude but also from the sensitivity of this system to this demographic rate. Identification of the relative importance of mechanisms that contribute to an invaders success is one of the major benefits of such modeling efforts. To identify empirically measurable quantities that provide the earliest warning of impact on the native species we tracked many population and individual level responses of Cerithidea to Batillarias invasion including population density biomass egg production mean size proportion of infected individuals and individual growth rate as well as availability of shared food resources. We used the empirically observed parameter values and an initial number of Batillaria invaders in these: simulations that guaranteed extinction of Cerithidea within 90 yr. Despite a rapid initial increase in invader populations all metrics for Cerithidea were slow to exhibit signs of impact. Most took at least 25 yr from invasion to exhibit detectable changes by which time the nonnative species was established at high densities (  3000 snails m(2)). Cerithidea egg production was the fastest most consistent response metric exhibiting declines within 20 25 yr after invasion in similar to 90 PeRcEnT of simulations. Difficulty in finding reliable early warning metrics has crucial implications for how we should view and conduct monitoring programs and risk assessment analyses. 768:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The spread of exotic species can be limited by dispersal or by constraints imposed by the local environment. Using data collected from 152 Missouri (USA) lakes over seven years we asked whether models based on dispersal. or local scale processes best predicted invasion by. the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi. We used multiple logistic regression to test the relative importance of 10 local physicochemical features and proximity to all known potential source populations for predicting which lakes were invaded. The decline in invasion likelihood with distance to source populations was used to estimate the shape of the dispersal kernel. Between 1992 and 1998 the cumulative prevalence of D. lumholtzi increased from 6 PeRcEnT to 34 PeRcEnT of lakes sampled with frequent appearances of populations in new watersheds. Spatial position and physical factors were both important for predicting the new colonization events. The probability of colonization increased with lake surface area and epilimnetic temperature declined with increasing conductivity and was unaffected by variation in lake fertility. Invasion likelihood declined sharply as a nonlinear function of distance to source populations up to around 30 km and was relatively constant at greater distances. The results suggest that dispersal and local abiotic constraints jointly limit the spread of D. lumholtzi. This approach illustrates how range expansion can be used to estimate dispersal rates at broad spatial scales. 815:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Advances in ecology during the past decade have led to a much more detailed understanding of the potential negative consequences of species introductions. Moreover recent studies of mycorrhizal symbionts have led to an increased knowledge of the potential utility of fungal inoculations in agricultural horticultural and ecological management. The intentional movement of mycorrhizal fungal species is growing but the concomitant potential for negative ecological consequences of invasions by mycorrhizal fungi is poorly understood. We assess the degree to which introductions of mycorrhizal fungi may lead to unintended negative and potentially costly consequences. Our purpose is to make recommendations regarding appropriate management guidelines and highlight top priority research needs. Given the difficulty in discerning invasive species problems associated with mycorrhizal inoculations we recommend the following. First careful assessment documenting the need for inoculation and the likelihood of success should be conducted prior to inoculation because inoculations are not universally beneficial. Second invasive species problems are costly and often impossible to control by the time they are recognized. We recommend using local inoculum sources whenever possible. Third non sterile cultures of inoculum can result in the movement of saprobes and pathogens as well as mutualists. We recommend using material that has been produced through sterile culture when local inoculum is not available. Finally life history characteristics of inoculated fungi may provide general guidelines relative to the likelihood of establishment and spread. We recommend that when using non local fungi managers choose fungal taxa that carry life history traits that may minimize the likelihood of deleterious invasive species problems. Additional research is needed on the potential of mycorrhizal fungi to spread to non target areas and cause ecological damage. 825:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Cost effective surveillance strategies are needed for efficient responses to biological invasions and must account for the trade offs between surveillance effort and management costs. Less surveillance may allow greater population growth and spread prior to detection thereby increasing the costs of damages and control. In addition surveillance strategies are usually applied in environments under continual invasion pressure where the number size and location of established populations are unknown prior to detection. We develop a novel modeling framework that accounts for these features of the decision and invasion environment and determines the long term sampling effort that minimises the total expected costs of new invasions. The optimal solution depends on population establishment and growth rates sample sensitivity and sample eradication and damage costs. We demonstrate how to optimise surveillance systems under budgetary constraints and find that accounting for spatial heterogeneity in sampling costs and establishment rates can greatly reduce management costs. 830:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ecologists have long sought to understand the relationships among species diversity community productivity and invasion by non native species. Here four long term observational datasets were analyzed using repeated measures statistics to determine how plant species richness and community resource capture  productivity) influenced invasion. Multiple factors influenced the results including the metric used to quantify invasion interannual variation and spatial scale. Native richness was positively correlated with non native richness but was usually negatively correlated with non native abundance and these patterns were stronger at the larger spatial scale. Logistic regressions indicated that the probability of invasion was reduced both within and following years with high productivity except at the desert grassland site where high productivity was associated with increased invasion. Our analysis suggests that while non natives were most likely to establish in species rich communities their success was diminished by high resource capture by the resident community. 843:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Introduced plant populations lose interactions with enemies mutualists and competitors from their native ranges and gain interactions with new species under new abiotic conditions. From a biogeographical perspective differences in the assemblage of interacting species as well as in abiotic conditions may explain the demographic success of the introduced plant populations relative to conspecifics in their native range. Within invaded communities the new interactions and conditions experienced by the invader may influence both its demographic success and its effects on native biodiversity. Here we examine indirect effects involving enemies mutualists and competitors of introduced plants and effects of abiotic conditions on biotic interactions. We then synthesize ideas building on Darwins idea that the kinds of new interactions gained by an introduced population will depend on its relatedness to native populations. This yields a heuristic framework to explain how biotic interactions and abiotic conditions influence invader success. We conclude that species introductions generally alter plants interactions with enemies mutualists and competitors and that there is increasing evidence that these altered interactions jointly influence the success of introduced populations. 859:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P Biological invasions are a global and increasing threat to the function and diversity of ecosystems. Allee effects (positive density dependence) have been shown to play an important role in the establishment and spread of non native species. Although Allee effects can be considered a bane in conservation efforts they can be a benefit in attempts to manage non native species. Many biological invaders are subject to some form of an Allee effect whether due to a need to locate mates cooperatively feed or reproduce or avoid becoming a meal yet attempts to highlight the specific exploitation of Allee effects in biological invasions are surprisingly unprecedented. In this review we highlight current strategies that effectively exploit an Allee effect and propose novel means by which Allee effects can be manipulated to the detriment of biological invaders. We also illustrate how the concept of Allee effects can be integral in risk assessments and in the prioritization of resources allocated to manage non native species as some species beset by strong Allee effects could be less successful as invaders. We describe how tactics that strengthen an existing Allee effect or create new ones could be used to manage biological invasions more effectively. 861:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, P Many ecosystems worldwide are dominated by introduced plant species leading to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem function. A common but rarely tested assumption is that these plants are more abundant in introduced vs. native communities because ecological or evolutionary based shifts in populations underlie invasion success. Here data for 26 herbaceous species at 39 sites within eight countries revealed that species abundances were similar at native (home) and introduced (away) sites grass species were generally abundant home and away while forbs were low in abundance but more abundant at home. Sites with six or more of these species had similar community abundance hierarchies suggesting that suites of introduced species are assembling similarly on different continents. Overall we found that substantial changes to populations are not necessarily a pre condition for invasion success and that increases in species abundance are unusual. Instead abundance at home predicts abundance away a potentially useful additional criterion for biosecurity programmes. 924:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Invasion of exotic species may be regulated either by regional factors (dispersal limitation) or by local site characteristics that influence colonization success (invasibility). To address the latter question we surveyed crustacean zooplankton and abiotic features of 171 lakes in Missouri Arkansas and Oklahoma and examined features associated with presence of the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi. The data set was also used to examine variation in zooplankton species composition in this region. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that zooplankton distributions were most strongly correlated with lake fertility and conductivity. Logistic regression analyses showed that D. lumholtzi was more likely to invade larger and more fertile lakes and appeared unaffected by native zooplankton species richness or presence of particular species. Thus the current study suggests that physico chemical characteristics are better predictors than zooplankton communities for explaining the regional spread of D. lumholtzi. Nevertheless the underlying causes for these trends are unclear as landscape features correlated to the same physical features may also influence dispersal processes and other unknown differences between lakes may also be important for colonization success. 934:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The importance of natural disturbances in shaping landscapes and influencing ecosystems is now well recognized in ecology. Disturbances span a broad range of sizes and frequencies and while understanding of relatively small disturbances has increased rapidly the ecological effects of disturbance events that are large in spatial extent and infrequent in occurrence are not well understood. Examples of these large and infrequent disturbances include volcanic eruptions big fires and extreme floods or storms. Whether large infrequent disturbances are qualitatively different from small frequent disturbances remains an unresolved issue in ecology in part because of a paucity of long term data on the effects of broad scale disturbances. The intensive post disturbance research focused on several large natural disturbances (for example the 1988 Yellowstone fires Hurricane Hugo in 1989 the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 and the 1993 floods in the Midwest) provides an opportunity to develop comparisons across these unusual events. The following set of articles begins to synthesize what is known about the ecological implications of large infrequent disturbances (LIDs). In this article we present the motivation for this synthesis by defining LIDs and discussing their ecological importance. LIDs are difficult to define objectively because disturbances occur across a continuum of sizes and frequencies. We follow White and Picketts definition of disturbance: any relatively discrete event in time that disrupts ecosystem community or population structure and changes resource substrate availability or the physical environment. This general but flexible definition requires the spatial and temporal scales of the system and the disturbance to be specified. Disturbances would typically be characterized by their size spatial distribution frequency or return interval predictability and magnitude including both intensity and severity. Along the disturbance continuum LIDs are much larger in spatial extent (terrestrial systems) or in depth duration (floods) than the disturbances that typically affect the system. Rather than producing a rigid definition we suggest two ways for identifying LIDs. 936:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, All species have evolved in the presence of disturbance and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Consequently disturbances within the typical range even at the extreme of that range as defined by large infrequent disturbances (LIDs) usually result in little long term change to the systems fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturbations within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physically based disturbance (for example storm volcanic eruption and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations such as overharvesting invasion and disease and their interactions. Dispersal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that describe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery and appear to have entered new domains or   ecological surprises.   In some cases three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state. We argue that in a world of ever more pervasive anthropogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common. Understanding these ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental management decisions of the 21st century. 941:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Disturbance events vary in intensity size and frequency but few opportunities exist to study those that are extreme on more than one of these gradients. This article characterizes successional processes that occur following infrequent disturbance events that are exceptional in their great intensity or large size. The spatial variability in disturbance intensity within large infrequent disturbances (LIDs) often leads to a heterogeneous pattern of surviving organisms. These surviving organisms dictate much of the initial successional pattern on large disturbances where the opportunities for seeds to disperse into the middle of the disturbance are limited. The traditional distinction between primary and secondary succession is insufficient to capture the tremendous variability in succession following LIDs. Disturbance size influences succession where long distance colonization by propagules is important. Observations from LIDs suggest the following interrelated hypotheses about trends in succession with increasing distance from seed sources when disturbance intensity is high: (a) initial densities of organisms will be lower; (b) nucleation processes in which recovering patches serve as foci for additional colonization and expand spatially will be more important; (c) competitive sorting will be less important relative to chance arrival in determination of community composition and (d) community composition will be initially less predictable; and (e) the rate of recovery of community composition will be slower. Prediction of succession following LIDs without considering contingencies such as the abundance types and spatial distribution of residuals and distance to seed sources is likely to be unsuccessful for large portions of the landscape. Abundance and spatial arrangement of survivors and arrival patterns of propagules may be the pivotal factors determining how succession differs between intense disturbances of large and small extent. 947:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Large infrequent disturbances (LIDs) can have significant impacts yet seldom are included in management plans. Although this neglect may stem from relative unfamiliarity with a kind of event that rarely occurs in the experience or jurisdiction of individual managers it may also reflect the assumption that LIDs are so large and powerful as to be beyond the ability of managers to affect. However some LIDs can be affected by management and for many of those that cannot be affected the resilience or recovery of the system disrupted by the disturbance can be influenced to meet management goals. Such results can be achieved through advanced planning that allows for LIDs whether caused by natural events human activities or a combination of the two. Management plans for LIDs may adopt a variety of goals depending on the nature of the system and the nature of the anticipated disturbance regime. Managers can choose to influence (a) the system prior to the disturbance (b) the disturbance itself (c) the system after the disturbance or (d) the recovery process. Prior to the disturbance the system can be managed in ways that alter its vulnerability or change how it will respond to a disturbance. The disturbance can be managed through no action preventive measures or manipulations that can affect the intensity or frequency of the disturbance. Recovery efforts can focus on either managing the state of the system immediately after the disturbance or managing the ongoing process of recovery. This review of the management implications of LIDs suggests that management actions should be tailored to particular disturbance characteristics and management goals. Management actions should foster survival of residuals and spatial heterogeneity that promote the desired recovery pattern and process. Most importantly however management plans need to recognize LIDs and include the potential for such disturbances to occur. 948:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Ln this article we develop a heuristic model of ecosystem disturbance dynamics that illustrates a range of responses of disturbance impact to gradients of increasing disturbance extent intensity or duration. Three general kinds of response are identified and illustrated (a) threshold response (b) scale independent response and (c) continuous response. Threshold responses are those in which the response curve shows a discontinuity or a sudden change in slope along the axis of increasing disturbance extent intensity or duration. The response threshold occurs at a point where the force of the disturbance exceeds the capacity of internal mechanisms to resist disturbance or where new mechanisms of recovery become involved. Within this conceptual framework we find that some unusually large or intense disturbances but not all produce qualitatively different responses compared with similar disturbances of lesser magnitude. If disturbance impact does not increase with increasing disturbance extent intensity or duration or if the response curve changes monotonically: then large disturbances are Mat qualitatively different from small ones. For example jack pine tends to become reestablished after stand replacing fire in boreal forests regardless of fire size because its serotinous cones provide an adequate seed source throughout the burned area. Thus large fires are not qualitatively different from small fires in terms of jack pine reproduction. However if disturbance impact does increase abruptly at some point with increasing disturbance extent intensity or duration often because of thresholds in the capacity of internal mechanisms to resist or respond to disturbance impact then large disturbances are qualitatively different from small ones at least for some parameters of ecological response. For example balsam fir and white cedar can recolonize a small burned patch of boreal forest in close proximity to surviving individuals of these species but they will be eliminated from a large burn because of their susceptibility to fire caused mortality and their inability to disperse their seeds over long distances. The conceptual framework presented here permits some new insights into the dynamics of natural systems and may provide a useful tool with which managers can assess the potential for catastrophic damages resulting from large infrequent disturbances. 959:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We review and compare well studied examples of five large infrequent disturbances (LIDs) fire hurricanes tornadoes volcanic eruptions and floods in terms of the physical processes involved the damage patterns they create in forested landscapes and the potential impacts of those patterns on subsequent forest development. Our examples include the 1988 Yellowstone fires the 1938 New England hurricane the 1985 Tionesta tornado the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and the 1993 Mississippi floods. The resulting landscape patterns are strongly controlled by interactions between the specific disturbance the abiotic environment (especially topography) and the composition and structure of the vegetation at the time of the disturbance. The very different natures of these interactions yield distinctive temporal and spatial patterns and demand that ecologists increase their knowledge of the physical characteristics of disturbance processes. Floods and fires can occur over a long period whereas volcanic eruptions and wind driven events often last for no more than a few hours or days. Tornadoes and floods produce linear patterns with sharp edges but fires volcanic eruptions and hurricanes can affect broader areas often with gradual transitions of disturbance intensity. In all cases the evidence suggests that LIDs produce enduring legacies of physical and biological structure that influence ecosystem processes for decades or centuries. 968:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Economic assessment of damage caused by invasive alien species provides useful information to consider when determining whether management programs should be established modified or discontinued. We estimate the baseline economic damage from an invasive alien pathogen Ceratocystis fagacearum a fungus that causes oak wilt which is a significant disease of oaks (Quercus spp.) in the central United States. We focus on Anoka County Minnesota a 1 156 km(2) mostly urban county in the Minneapolis Saint Paul metropolitan region. We develop a landscape level model of oak wilt spread that accounts for underground and overland pathogen transmission. We predict the economic damage of tree mortality from oak wilt spread in the absence of management during the period 2007 2016. Our metric of economic damage is removal cost which is one component of the total economic loss from tree mortality. We estimate that Anoka County has 5.92 million oak trees and 885 active oak wilt pockets covering 5.47 km(2) in 2007. The likelihood that landowners remove infected oaks varies by land use and ranges from 86 PeRcEnT on developed land to 57 PeRcEnT on forest land. Over the next decade depending on the rates of oak wilt pocket establishment and expansion 76 266 thousand trees will be infected with discounted removal cost of  DoLlQuAnT 18 60 million. Although our predictions of removal costs are substantial they are lower bounds on the total economic loss from tree mortality because we do not estimate economic losses from reduced services and increased hazards. Our predictions suggest that there are significant economic benefits in terms of damage reduction from preventing new pocket establishment or slowing the radial growth of existing pockets. 992:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The California Floristic Province exhibits one of the richest floras on the planet with more than 5500 native plant species approximately 40 PeRcEnT of which are endemic. Despite its impressive diversity and the attention it has garnered from ecologists and evolutionary biologists historical causes of species richness and endemism in California remain poorly understood. Using a phylogenetic analysis of 16 angiosperm clades each containing California natives in addition to species found only outside California we show that CAs current biodiversity primarily results from low extinction rates as opposed to elevated speciation or immigration rates. Speciation rates in California were lowest among Arcto Tertiary lineages  those colonizing California from the north during the Tertiary) but extinction rates were universally low across California native plants of all historical geographic origins. In contrast to long accepted ideas we find that California diversification rates were generally unaffected by the onset of the Mediterranean climate. However the Mediterranean climate coincided with immigration of many desert species validating one previous hypothesis regarding origins of CAs plant diversity. This study implicates topographic complexity and climatic buffering as key long standing features of CAs landscape favoring plant species persistence and diversification and highlights California as an important refuge under changing climates. 1000:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Emerging infectious diseases threaten a wide diversity of animals and important questions remain concerning disease emergence in socially structured populations. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to investigate whether and under what conditions disease related mortality can impact rates of pathogen spread in populations of polygynous groups. Specifically we investigated whether pathogen mediated dispersal (PMD) can occur when females disperse after the resident male dies from disease thus carrying infections to new groups. We also examined the effects of incubation period and virulence host mortality and rates of background dispersal and we used the model to investigate the spread of the virus responsible for Ebola hemorrhagic fever which currently is devastating African ape populations. Output was analyzed using regression trees which enable exploration of hierarchical and non linear relationships. Analyses revealed that the incidence of disease in single male (polygynous) groups was significantly greater for those groups containing an average of more than six females while the total number of infected hosts in the population was most sensitive to the number of females per group. Thus as expected PMD occurs in polygynous groups and its effects increase as harem size (the number of females) increases. Simulation output further indicated that population level effects of Ebola are likely to differ among multi male multi female chimpanzees and polygynous gorillas with larger overall numbers of chimpanzees infected but more gorilla groups becoming infected due to increased dispersal when the resident male dies. Collectively our results highlight the importance of social system on the spread of disease in wild mammals. 1001:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In experimental populations of the cowpea bean weevil Callosobruchus maculatus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) and a parasitic wasp Heterospilus prosopidis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) large changes in the abundances and the fluctuations of both species occurred after approximately 20 generations. In this paper we examine the hypothesis that this observed change in the dynamics may have been caused by an evolutionary shift in the mode of competition among the bean weevils. A Nicholson Bailey type model is developed using parameters measured from the experiments. The host larvae can differ in the type of competitive behaviour that they exhibit which can be either of a contest type or of a scramble type. If a bean contains one or more larvae of the contest type only one of these will survive and any scramble type larvae in the bean will be killed. If no contest type larvae are present within a bean multiple individuals of the scramble type can emerge from a single bean. The model assumes many genotypes differing in the fraction of offspring of the two types. If a high per capita resource availability is maintained then the scramble type is selected for but if resources are limited then the contest type is selected for. The host population at the start of the experiment taken from a stock culture was composed mostly of the scramble type. The model is successful in explaining the initial quick increase in the hosts abundance followed by the evolutionary increase in the fraction of the contest type among hosts resulting in the more stable population dynamics of the host parasitoid system as observed in the experiments. However it predicts a parasitoid abundance much higher than that observed. We discuss alternative hypotheses to explain the observed evolutionary shift in the population dynamics. We also examine the effect of the difference in size of the beans in the stock culture and those used in the experiments. 1008:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Free ranging animals are exposed to a diverse array of parasitic worms including nematodes trematodes cestodes and acanthocephalans. Across host species the number and types of parasite species are expected to depend on both host and parasite characteristics. We focused on helminth communities reported from free living anthropoid primates to investigate factors associated with parasite diversity in a single host clade. We used a comparative data set of 305 host parasite combinations representing 69 anthropoid primate species and 136 parasite species based on records obtained from the Host Parasite Database at the Natural History Museum London. We examined four sets of host characteristics that are predicted to influence parasite diversity in primates: host body size and life history; social contact and population density; diet; and individual ranging behaviour. We controlled for effects of uneven sampling effort on per host measures of parasite diversity and repeated analyses with and without controlling for host phylogeny. In tests that did not control for host phylogeny a large number of predictor variables were significantly associated with the diversity of both total helminths and nematode parasites including body size life history variables and day range length. However multivariate tests revealed that body mass and to a lesser extent social group size accounted for most variation in parasite species richness. Analyses that controlled for host phylogeny using independent contrasts showed that diet (estimated as the percentage of leaves in diet) was positively associated with total helminth and nematode parasite diversity in analyses that excluded outliers. Individual ranging behaviour was positively associated with the diversity of parasites with complex life cycles including cestodes trematodes and acanthocephalans. Our results demonstrate that several key features of host biology are likely to influence the community diversity of helminths in wild primate populations including body size diet sociality and ranging behaviour. 1009:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, If individuals of different species vary in their risk of acquiring infectious disease this variation is expected to result in systematic differences in immune defence structures across species. I used phylogenetic comparative methods to examine the correlates of spleen mass in primates based on a priori hypotheses involving disease risk sexual selection and correlations among organ systems. All comparative tests controlled for body mass. Contrary to predictions that more social species experience greater risk of acquiring infectious disease and should therefore exhibit increased immune defence spleen mass was not associated with measures of sociality. Species with slower life histories had larger spleens as expected if such species come into contact with a greater number of parasites throughout life. However spleen mass was unrelated to use of the ground or increased mating promiscuity both of which are thought to increase transmission of parasites. In contrast to patterns documented in previous research on birds primate spleen mass showed no association with sexual selection involving male male competition. The comparative tests found only one correlation among the spleen and other organs involving the liver which has some immune defence functions early in life. Several factors may explain the general absence of support for patterns in primates as compared to patterns documented previously in birds including differences in the expression of sexual selection and the involvement of the mammalian spleen in bodily functions unrelated to immune defence. These analyses suggest that spleen mass is not a useful predictor of disease risk in primates which is important for future comparative research on the correlates of parasitism in mammals. 1047:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most of us can close our eyes and imagine a future in which ecological data are at our fingertips as easy to access online as current weather conditions satellite images of our field sites or cute videos of kittens. In this future we can easily find information about the temporal trends of aphid outbreaks around the world or the spatial occurrences of Atlantic cod to use in research or in the classroom. We can imagine services that operate behind the scenes__ to intelligently aggregate data and allow for tailored datasets and analytics such as averaging soil respiration rates within a certain elevational band or estimating the age structure of local deer populations. Although we can easily imagine these developments and perhaps happily anticipate them very few of us act as though we are the generation of scientists that will make them happen. We are not documenting sharing or archiving our data in ways to ensure that this future is attainable. Surveys demonstrate that we record our data in highly idiosyncratic ways with much of the information about the data collection (metadata) remaining as oral history within a research group. After the data have been used for publication their electronic datasheets steadily atrophy in hardware and software that become obsolete and associated metadata are often forgotten. After careful planning and collection by experts valuable ecological datasets are gathering dust in small piles all over the world. Why are we so reluctant to preserve our data for the long term in public archives? The reasons given for not doing so are diverse and many authors have preceded us in analyzing the anachronistic lack of data sharing in ecology. In short ecologists see few near term rewards and many costs associated with making data public. Making matters worse very few ecologists have a clear idea of how they would go about sharing data even if they wanted to. Thus while ecologists are as active as any other group in embracing the Information Age from smartphones for field research to distributed software development for statistics paradoxically we are still keeping our hard won ecological data hoarded in idiosyncratic lockboxes. If this world of readily accessible ecological data is coming __someday__ how do we get there from here? How can we become the generation of ecologists that creates the bridge to that future of ecological data access? We propose a first step: treat your ecological data as a real product of research not just a precursor to a set of publications. Many of our datasets are irreplaceable documenting organisms patterns and ecosystems that are rapidly changing. With this in mind manage your data with the conviction that they will have a lifetime far beyond your own. Document your data for someone a stranger who will discover the information decades from now. As a simple starting point read Borer . an introductory paper with sound and practical suggestions with your research group or journal club. To see the level of detail you might need to consider examine sources like Ecological Archives the Ecological Society of Americas journal geared toward publishing self describing datasets. Start creating machine readable metadata early in your project even before data collection begins through free software like Morpho. This step facilitates sharing your data and metadata with colleagues now and uploading to public repositories when you are ready. Repositories such as Ecological Archives connect your dataset to many others in the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity and opportunities for connecting datasets will grow with improvements in cyberinfrastructure such as the US National Science Foundations (NSFs) DataNet project known as DataONE which will confederate environmental data from many repositories. The NSFs recent requirement that data management plans be included in all proposals is a logical step toward data publication and many believe that it may provide a tipping point for broad adoption of data publication policies in the US. In our opinion widespread sharing of ecological data will be a welcome change. If ecologists are to have societal relevance alerting managers to unusually rapid range expansions in non native species illuminating long term oscillations in fish production or determining the historical distribution of a plant with newly discovered medicinal properties we need to get serious about bringing our discipline into the Information Age now by documenting and sharing data. What may be perceived as a waste of time to this generation of ecologists will not be viewed that way by future researchers who will be prepared to engage in more transparent and open science. 1066:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, New studies have detected a rising number of reports of diseases in marine organisms such as corals molluscs turtles mammals and echinoderms over the past three decades. Despite the increasing disease load microbiological molecular and theoretical tools for managing disease in the worlds oceans are underdeveloped. Review of the new developments in the study of these diseases identifies five major unsolved problems and priorities for future research: (1) detecting origins and reservoirs for marine diseases and tracing the flow of some new pathogens from land to sea; (2) documenting the longevity and host range of infectious stages; (3) evaluating the effect of greater taxonomic diversity of marine relative to terrestrial hosts and pathogens; (4) pinpointing the facilitating role of anthropogenic agents as incubators and conveyors of marine pathogens; (5) adapting epidemiological models to analysis of marine disease. 1072:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Through the work of international public health organizations and advancements in the biological and technological sciences substantial progress has been made in our ability to prevent control locally eliminate and in one case eradicate infectious diseases. Yet each successful control or local elimination has been met with the emergence of new pathogens the evolution of novel strains or different epidemiological circumstances that have limited or reversed control methods. To respond to the increasing threat of emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism it is vital that we design and implement efficient programs that prevent and control infectious pathogen transmission. The theoretical tools of ecology and epidemiology may be the cornerstone in constructing future programs aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases throughout the world. 1079:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Hibernation may alter the relationship between pathogens and their hosts; low host temperatures can prevent pathogen replication. Therefore manipulating the timing and duration of torpor bouts could allow animals to gain an advantage over pathogens. 2 Thirty two Turkish Hamsters (Mesocricetus brandti) were placed in short day cold conditions. After 10 weeks 20 animals were challenged with an antigen to simulate a pathogen infection. Ten of these animals were returned to the cold (cold challenged). The other 10 animals were placed in warm conditions (warm challenged). Twelve animals received saline injections and were returned to the cold (cold control). Cold challenged animals spent significantly more time in torpor than did cold control animals. 3 After 6.5 weeks all animals were housed in warm conditions and ceased torpor. Both cold challenged and warm challenged animals received a second injection of antigen. There was no correlation between time spent euthermic and level of secondary humoral response of cold challenged animals. The secondary humoral response of the cold challenged animals was significantly lower than that of warm challenged animals. Ln this study immune status influenced torpor duration and torpor caused immunosuppression. Hibernators may manipulate body temperature in order to combat pathogens while their own immune systems are suppressed. 111:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We present a susceptibles exposed infectives (SEI) model to analyze the effects of seasonality on epidemics mainly of rabies in a wide range of wildlife species. Model parameters are cast as simple allometric functions of host body size. Via nonlinear analysis we investigate the dynamical behavior of the disease for different levels of seasonality in the transmission rate and for different values of the pathogen basic reproduction number (R(0)) over a broad range of body sizes. While the unforced SEI model exhibits long term epizootic cycles only for large values of R(0) the seasonal model exhibits multiyear periodicity for small values of R(0). The oscillation period predicted by the seasonal model is consistent with those observed in the field for different host species. These conclusions are not affected by alternative assumptions for the shape of seasonality or for the parameters that exhibit seasonal variations. However the introduction of host immunity (which occurs for rabies in some species and is typical of many other wildlife diseases) significantly modifies the epidemic dynamics; in this case multiyear cycling requires a large level of seasonal forcing. Our analysis suggests that the explicit inclusion of periodic forcing in models of wildlife disease may be crucial to correctly describe the epidemics of wildlife that live in strongly seasonal environments. 1146:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Comparative studies have revealed strong links between ecological factors and the number of parasite species harboured by different hosts but studies of different taxonomic host groups have produced inconsistent results. As a step towards understanding the general patterns of parasite species richness we present results from a new comprehensive data base of over 7000 host parasite combinations representing 146 species of carnivores (Mammalia: Carnivora) and 980 species of parasites. We used both phylogenetic and non phylogenetic comparative methods while controlling for unequal sampling effort within a multivariate framework to ascertain the main determinants of parasite species richness in carnivores. We found that body mass population density geographical range size and distance from the equator are correlated with overall parasite species richness in fissiped carnivores. When parasites are classified by transmission mode body mass and home range area are the main determinants of the richness of parasites spread by close contact between hosts and population density geographical range size and distance from the equator account for the diversity of parasites that are not dependent on close contact. For generalist parasites population density geographical range size and latitude are the primary predictors of parasite species richness. We found no significant ecological correlates for the richness of specialist or vector borne parasites. Although we found that parasite species richness increases instead of decreases with distance from the equator other comparative patterns in carnivores support previous findings in primates suggesting that similar ecological factors operate in both these independent evolutionary lineages. 117:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Laboratory ethnographies are the shop fiber studies of the knowledge economy. Observational data from II months of field work in a multidisciplinary neuroscience lab suggest that scientific skepticism. long understood as an evaluative mechanism also serves social control and monitoring functions. The author applies insights from organization theory social psychology science studies and the sociology of science to demonstrate that skepticism is socially organized at the microlevel of laboratory interactions. This organization makes skepticism a solution to the problems of control coordination and evaluation raised by uncertain scientific work conducted in a physically dispersed multidisciplinary setting. The diverse roles skepticism plays in laboratory interactions resonate with examinations of work in a number of occupational settings while providing direct insight into mechanisms that may account for the patterning of rewards and status across knowledge intensive workplaces. 1190:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We extrapolate a new range of estimates of the species richness of Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) wasps a diverse group of small parasitoids that attack caterpillars of Lepidoptera. Our estimates using an array of focal study faunas to provide reasonable bounds for minimum and maximum values range from 17000 to 46000 species. These calculations make use of a geographically relatively constant proportion of the total number of local caterpillar species to species of Microgastrinae and extend what is known from better studied areas to those less thoroughly studied. This new estimate of species richness for Microgastrinae is 8 20 times that of the approximate to 2000 currently described species and 2 10 times greater than that of previously published estimates. 1199:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Multihost parasites have been implicated in the emergence of new diseases in humans and wildlife yet little is known about factors that influence the host range of parasites in natural populations. We used a comprehensive data set of 415 micro and macroparasites reported from 119 wild primate hosts to investigate broad patterns of host specificity. The majority (68 PeRcEnT) of primate parasites were reported to infect multiple host species including animals from multiple families or orders. This pattern corresponds to previous studies of parasites found in humans and domesticated animals. Within three parasite groups (viruses protozoans and helminths) we examined parasite taxonomy and transmission strategy in relation to measures of host specificity. Relative to other parasite groups helminths were associated with the greatest levels of host specificity whereas most viruses were reported to infect hosts from multiple families or orders. Highly significant associations between the degree of host specificity and transmission strategy arose within each parasite group but not always in the same direction suggesting that unique constraints influence the host range of parasites within each taxonomic group. Finally characteristics of over 100 parasite species shared between wild primates and humans including those recognised as emerging in humans revealed that most of these shared parasites were reported from multiple host orders. Furthermore nearly all viruses that were reported to infect both humans and non human primates were classified as emerging in humans. 11:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Experimental laboratory systems of bruchid beetles Callosobruchus in particular and their parasitoids have been used as models to study population dynamics of single species and host parasitoid interactions since the early 1940s. First this paper reviews the recent advances in ecological studies on laboratory systems of bruchid hosts and their parasitoids as represented by bottom up and top down controls. Factors controlling the persistence of simple host parasitoid systems that can be modified by an evolutionary change in a host beetle are demonstrated with reference to local carrying capacity vulnerable time window of hosts to parasitism and functional response of parasitoids. Second we present experimental results on persistence of larger species assemblies analyzed in the light of the simple two species host parasitoid control factors. The most persistent association of species showed that both host and parasitoid control factors in the simple host parasitoid system were consistently effective in the larger species complexes. There was also a general loss of persistence of host parasitoid associations as species richness increased. Finally at the interface between simple and complex assemblies we asked how an addition of a third species to a simple host parasitoid system affects resilience and duration of transients with the Callosobruchus beetles as the host and two parasitoids (the pteromalid Anisopteromalus calandrae and braconid Heterospilus prosopidis). Semi mechanistic models parameterized by fitting to the population data were constructed to help understand the driving forces that govern the behavior of interacting populations. The population dynamics of the three species system was ascribed to cyclic chaotic transient dynamics towards an attractor that has potential of not only a stable equilibrium but also a chaotic one. By comparing the three species dynamics to the stable two species (one host one parasitold) dynamics before H. prosopidis was introduced the instability that leads to chaos was revealed to be induced by density dependent host feeding by A. calandrae. Although the destabilizing host feeding was under the control of a stabilizing effect of mutual interference the effect was estimated to be weakened by the introduction of the second parasitoid H. prosopidis. 1202:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, A more rigorous and nuanced understanding of land use change (LUC) as a driver of emerging infectious disease (EID) is required. Here we examine post hunter gatherer LUC as a driver of infectious disease in one biogeographical region with a compressed and documented history continental Australia. We do this by examining land use and native vegetation change (LUCC) associations with infectious disease emergence identified through a systematic (1973 2010) and historical (1788 1973) review of infectious disease literature of humans and animals. We find that 22 PeRcEnT (20) of the systematically reviewed EIDs are associated with LUCC most frequently where natural landscapes have been removed or replaced with agriculture plantations livestock or urban development. Historical clustering of vector borne zoonotic and environmental disease emergence also follows major periods of extensive land clearing. These advanced stages of LUCC are accompanied by changes in the distribution and density of hosts and vectors at varying scales and chronology. This review of infectious disease emergence in one continent provides valuable insight into the association between accelerated global LUC and concurrent accelerated infectious disease emergence. 1206:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The global resurgence and emergence of new mosquito borne diseases and increasing resistance of mosquitoes to chemical pesticides have prompted renewed interest in biocontrol methods that use aquatic predators of mosquito larvae. For disease vectors with complex life cycles like mosquitoes in which adults are terrestrial and choose aquatic habitats in which to deposit their offspring shifts in oviposition site selection may have important consequences for vector population dynamics and epidemiology. While there have been numerous studies of mosquito oviposition site selection methodology and results vary making it difficult to evaluate the general importance of predator induced shifts in oviposition site selection for biocontrol scenarios. Here we use meta analysis to provide a quantitative framework for examining variation in mosquito oviposition responses to predators. Overall we find a broad pattern of predator avoidance among mosquito and predator taxa. The primary factor explaining variation in oviposition response appears to be taxonomic and or life history related avoidance is weakest or non existent in Aedes species that oviposit eggs above water in container habitats. Responses also varied among predators. Generally oviposition avoidance was strongest in response to fish and insects weak or nonexistent in response to notostracans urodeles or dipterans and there is limited evidence that some mosquitoes are attracted to cyclopoid crustaceans. Our results highlight that predator avoidance during oviposition is common but not ubiquitous in mosquitoes and needs to be considered when evaluating the likely efficacy of aquatic predators for biocontrol. 1213:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Parasites and infectious diseases have become a major concern in conservation biology in part because they can trigger or accelerate species or population declines. Focusing on primates as a well studied host clade we tested whether the species richness and prevalence of parasites differed between threatened and non threatened host species. We collated data on 386 species of parasites (including viruses bacteria protozoa helminths and arthropods) reported to infect wild populations of 36 threatened and 81 non threatened primate species. Analyses controlled for uneven sampling effort and host phylogeny. Results showed that total parasite species richness was lower among threatened primates supporting the prediction that small isolated host populations harbour fewer parasite species. This trend was consistent across three major parasite groups found in primates (helminths protozoa and viruses). Counter to our predictions patterns of parasite species richness were independent of parasite transmission mode and the degree of host specificity. We also examined the prevalence of selected parasite genera among primate sister taxa that differed in their ranked threat categories but found no significant differences in prevalence between threatened and non threatened hosts. This study is the first to demonstrate differences in parasite richness relative to host threat status. Results indicate that human activities and host characteristics that increase the extinction risk of wild animal species may lead simultaneously to the loss of parasites. Lower average parasite richness in threatened host taxa also points to the need for a better understanding of the cascading effects of host biodiversity loss for affiliated parasite species. 1214:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent studies have evaluated the distribution of specialization in species interaction networks. Species abundance patterns have been hypothesized to determine observed topological patterns. We evaluate this hypothesis in the context of host parasite interaction networks. We used two independent series of data sets one consisting of data for seven sites describing interactions between freshwater fish and their metazoan parasites and another consisting of data for 25 localities describing interactions between fleas and their mammalian hosts. We evaluated the influence of species abundance patterns on the distribution of specialization in these host parasite interaction networks with the aid of null models. In parallel with recent studies of plant animal mutualistic networks our analyses suggest that host parasite interactions in these systems are highly asymmetric: specialist parasites tend to interact with hosts with high parasite richness whereas hosts with low parasite richness tend to interact mainly with generalist parasites. The observed distribution of specialization was predicted by a null model that assumed that species specific probabilities of being assigned a link during the randomization process were roughly proportional to their relative abundance. Thus abundant hosts tend to harbour richer parasite faunas with a high proportion of rare specialists. 121:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,122:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,123:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,123:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are known to exist in wild and domesticated animals but little is know about behavioural defences that animals use to reduce the risk of acquiring STDs. Using comparative data and a phylogeny of primates I investigated whether behaviours hypothesized to reduce STD transmission are correlated with measures of STD risk involving mating promiscuity and life history traits. Comparative tests revealed no support for genital inspection as a means to identify and avoid infected individuals with genital inspection was performed more commonly by males than females and uncorrelated with mating promiscuity. Primate species characterized by increased promiscuity were not more likely to display genital self grooming following mating. Similarly males and females of these species were not more likely to urinate immediately after mating counter to suggestions that urination flushes microorganisms from the urethra and surrounding genital areas. Finally monogamy was not correlated with a slow life history which differs from predictions that monogamy is a response to increased STD risk in long lived animals. Tests involving monogamy remained unsupported after controlling for potentially confounding variables and all tests yielded similar results in phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic tests. Few results were significant even before controlling statistically for multiple comparisons but nonsignificance was unlikely due to low statistical power or poor data quality in all tests. Instead the comparative patterns were consistent with theoretical models showing that precopulatory behavioural defences to STDs such as mate choice are unlikely to be fully effective. In addition many putative behavioural defences to STDs in primates entail substantial fitness costs in terms of reproductive output offspring quality and infanticide avoidance. 1272:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Using a population model of selection on an obligate symbiont and its host we evaluate how demographic differences across geographical landscapes can produce selection mosaics in interacting species. The model assumes that the host populations vary geographically from demographic sources to sinks in the absence of effects by the symbionts and that a virulent and a relatively avirulent form of the symbiont compete with one another across all habitats. Our results indicate that productivity gradients can create selection mosaics across habitats resulting in complex fitness landscapes over which evolution occurs. We find that relatively virulent symbionts only persist if they have an advantage over avirulent strains or species in terms of interference  competition and or cross transmission) interactions. When such a trade off exists we predict that the more virulent symbiont is most likely to be found in habitats where host population growth is highest whereas the more avirulent symbiont should tend to persist in more marginal habitats or even habitat sinks for symbiont free hosts. Demographic sinks may be the habitats most likely to favour the origin of new mutualisms. Very productive mutualisms can be exploited by hyperparasites or cheaters. We discuss our findings in terms of geographical scenarios for the emergence of mutualisms and the long standing debate about geographical patterns in the maintenance of sex. 1308:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Home range size and shape are influenced by cost benefit relationships associated with acquiring resources. Subterranean animals may be particularly affected by food availability and soil conditions because of the close coupling of their activity to soil and the high energetic expense of digging. We examined foraging tunnel length area and geometry  number of branches and turning angles) of 3 species of pocket gophers (Geomys attwateri Geomys bursarius and Thomomys bottae) in their natural habitats which differed in food abundance and soil characteristics. Burrow features (except length and area) were similar among species sexes ages and habitats. However burrows of adults were longer and occupied larger areas than those of juveniles and burrow system length and area decreased with increasing vegetation biomass and with increasing soil clay content of soil  increasing expense of digging). Our findings reveal common patterns of burrow geometry which suggest that there may be an underlying strategy defining geometric features of burrows within this family of subterranean rodents. 1314:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The Anopheles quadrimaculatus s.l. (Say) complex consists of at least five species distinguished by distribution genetic incompatibility and allele frequencies. However the distributions of the members have only been described by collection locations. Building on this information and environmental data preliminary predictions of their distribution were produced using a genetic algorithm and point occurrence data. Based on resulting predicted border areas and undersampled regions we obtained and analyzed additional geo referenced specimens and compared their distribution with our preliminary predictions. We found good agreement between the preliminary predictions and the subsequent collections regardless of the fact that additional specimens were deliberately sought from areas most likely to reveal inconsistencies. Final predicted distributions describe widespread distribution of A.quadrintaculatus throughout the eastern United States. A. maverlius and A. smaragdinus have similar predicted ranges limited to the southeastern United States. The predicted ranges of the sister taxa A. diluvialis and A. inundatus were similar to one another along the southeastern coast even though they seem to be allopatric. The historical role of A. quadrimaculatus s.l. in transmission of malaria was also examined. We conclude that A. quadrimaculatus s.s. was the only species of the complex capable of vectoring malaria in the United States throughout the area in which malaria occurred. However any or all the members of the complex may have been regionally important particularly in areas of most intense transmission. 1315:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have invaded waters across Europe for over 200 years they colonized Ireland only within the past decade. To test the hypothesis that Ireland was colonized by adult D. polymorpha we examined mussels from different sites along the Lower Shannon River system in Ireland for the presence of host specific and generalist endosymbionts.Within the mantle cavity and or associated with zebra mussel tissues we found species specific ciliates (Conchophthirus acuminatus and Ophryoglena hemophaga) and generalist symbionts (the ciliate Ancistrumina limnica nematodes oligochaetes and chironomids). We found a significant difference in the prevalence of symbionts among sites but all mussels at all sites harboured one specialist species C. acuminatus and all of the mussels at three of the four sites also had the second specialist O. hemophaga. Thus with the introduction of D. polymorpha into Ireland at least two additional species their host specific symbionts C. acuminatus and O. hemophaga have also been introduced. The presence of these symbionts in Ireland supports the hypothesis that adult zebra mussels were introduced into Ireland rather than larval stages. This contrasts with the introduction of zebra mussels to North America where adult zebra mussels are devoid of host specific symbionts. 1318:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Fecal samples from 55 free ranging olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Mole National Park Ghana were collected 22 June 7 July 2008 and analyzed for gastrointestinal parasites. This is the first survey of baboon gastrointestinal parasites in Ghana and provides baseline data for this area. Ninety three percent of samples were infected leaving 7 PeRcEnT with no parasites observed. Of those infected there was a 76 PeRcEnT prevalence of strongyles 53 PeRcEnT Strongyloides spp. 11 PeRcEnT Abbreviata caucasica 62 PeRcEnT prevalence of Balanitidium coli (trophozoites and cysts identified) 4 PeRcEnT Entomeba hystolyticahhspar and 47 PeRcEnT unidentified protozoan parasites. Of the strongyle infections 9 PeRcEnT were identified as Oesophagosimnum sp. One sample contained an unidentified spirurid nematode that resembled Gongylonema sp. Mole has a mixed forest savanna habitat and baboons frequently range into human areas which makes them subject to parasites from each habitat and multiple sources of exposure. We found a high prevalence of nematode parasites consistent with a wet or cooler forest environment or high rates of fecal contamination. The presence of Strongyloides sp. E. hystoliticaldispar and B. coil suggest potential public health risk from baboons but molecular identification of these parasites and documentation of their presence in local human populations would be necessary to confirm zoonotic transmission. 1332:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Principles of self organization play an increasingly central role in models of human activity. Notably individual human displacements exhibit strongly recurrent patterns that are characterized by scaling laws and can be mechanistically modelled as self attracting walks. Recurrence is not however unique to human displacements. Here we report that the mobility patterns of wild capuchin monkeys are not random walks and they exhibit recurrence properties similar to those of cell phone users suggesting spatial cognition mechanisms shared with humans. We also show that the highly uneven visitation patterns within monkey home ranges are not entirely self generated but are forced by spatio temporal habitat heterogeneities. If models of human mobility are to become useful tools for predictive purposes they will need to consider the interaction between memory and environmental heterogeneities. 1333:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seasonal changes in the environment are known to be important drivers of population dynamics giving rise to sustained population cycles. However it is often difficult to measure the strength and shape of seasonal forces affecting populations. In recent years statistical time series methods have been applied to the incidence records of childhood infectious diseases in an attempt to estimate seasonal variation in transmission rates as driven by the pattern of school terms. In turn school term forcing was used to show how susceptible influx rates affect the interepidemic period. In this paper we document the response of measles dynamics to distinct shifts in the parameter regime using previously unexplored records of measles mortality from the early decades of the twentieth century. We describe temporal patterns of measles epidemics using spectral analysis techniques and point out a marked decrease in birth rates over time. Changes in host demography alone do not however suffice to explain epidemiological transitions. By fitting the time series susceptible infected recovered model to measles mortality data we obtain estimates of seasonal transmission in different eras and find that seasonality increased over time. This analysis supports theoretical work linking complex population dynamics and the balance between stochastic and deterministic forces as determined by the strength of seasonality. 133:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,134:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1356:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, While many animals respond to seasonal variation in their environment animals such as pocket gophers Thomomys bottae that live below ground might seem to be buffered against such variation. In some areas however the patterns of burrowing activity by pocket gophers are tied to the seasons one factor of which is rainfall. Variation in activity patterns may result from the ease of digging in moist soil or increased food availability during the wet season. Previous simulation modelling work suggests that food availability influences burrowing patterns while soil conditions do not. Thus field experiments were used to investigate how soil conditions and food availability influence seasonal burrowing activity. Results indicate that an increase in soil moisture initiates activity. After this initial increase in activity mound production declines and reaches a steady rate which can be supported by vegetation availability in agreement with previous model results. Our findings support the idea that moist soil promotes a burst of digging activity potentially for burrow maintenance when soil becomes easily workable and the eventual growth of vegetation provides the food necessary to support continued activity. 1381:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper gives a general definition of a   kind of schema   ( often called a   meta model   in the literature but here called a   species  ) along with general definitions for the schemas of a species and for the databases constraints and queries over a given schema of a species. This leads naturally to a general theory of data translation and integration over arbitrary schemas of arbitrary species based on schema morphisms and to a similar general theory of ontology translation and integration over arbitrary logics. Institutions provide a general notion of logic and Grothendieck flattening provides a general tool for integrating heterogeneous schemas species and logics as well as theories such as ontologies over different logics. Many examples of our novel concepts are included some rather detailed. An initial section introduces data integration and ontologies for readers who are not specialists with some emphasis on challenges. A brief review of universal algebra is also given though some familiarity with category theory is assumed in later sections. 1382:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  The clinical presentation of pregnancy associated malaria or PAM depends crucially on the particular epidemiological settings. This can potentially lead to an underestimation of its overall burden on the female population especially in regions prone to epidemic outbreaks and where malaria transmission is generally low. Here by re examining historical data it is demonstrated how excess female mortality can be used to evaluate the burden of PAM. A simple mathematical model is then developed to highlight the contrasting signatures of PAM within the endemicity spectrum and to show how PAM is influenced by the intensity and stability of transmission. Both the data and the model show that maternal malaria has a huge impact on the female population. This is particularly pronounced in low transmission settings during epidemic outbreaks where excess female mortality morbidity can by far exceed that of a similar endemic setting. The results presented here call for active intervention measures not only in highly endemic regions but also or in particular in areas where malaria transmission is low and seasonal. 1391:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite the intense impact of diseases on tropical marine communities little is known about mechanisms of resistance to disease or the role of disease as a selective factor in these communities. Spatial variation in chemical resistance of Gorgonia ventalina (sea fan coral) to the fungus Aspergillus sydowii was investigated by sampling G. ventalina populations in the Florida Keys USA and San Salvador Bahamas. A. sydowii is the causative agent in aspergillosis a fungal disease affecting G. ventalina throughout the Caribbean. Using field census and experimental inoculation this study examines if sea fan chemical extracts provide resistance to disease caused by A. sydowii and the potential role of disease as a selective force in shaping the chemical defenses of sea fan populations. Chemical resistance against A. sydowii was assessed with a fungal growth assay. Higher anti fungal activity of small versus large fans observed in field sampling and increased disease severity in mature versus young fans in inoculation studies support the hypothesis that resistance decreases with increasing fan age. This result is also consistent with patterns predicted by the optimal defense theory and growth differentiation balance hypotheses in plant studies. Anti fungal activity of large sea fans increased upon inoculation consistent with the hypothesis of inducible resistance. Anti fungal activity of sea fan extracts from the Florida Keys and Bahamas did vary significantly with site and was negatively correlated with fan height and extract concentration (mg extract per g dry coral weight). Anti fungal activity did not correlate significantly with disease status in a multiple regression model. The mean anti fungal activity of sea fans varied significantly among Florida Keys but not among San Salvador sites nor between Florida Keys and San Salvador sites. Disease pressure was not correlated with anti fungal activity across sites as would be expected under a simple resistance selection model. A simple mean resistance selection model may not be appropriate in relatively open marine systems in which environmental induction may obscure natural selection. However the coefficient of variation in anti fungal activity among sites is negatively correlated with disease pressure consistent with the hypothesis that A. sydowii imposes detectable directional selection and eliminates susceptible individuals from sites with high disease pressure. 1410:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The importance of data archiving data sharing and public access to data has received considerable attention. Awareness is growing among scientists that collaborative databases can facilitate these activities. We provide a detailed description of the collaborative life history database developed by our Working Group at the National Evolutionary Center to address questions about life history patterns and the evolution of mortality and demographic variability in wild primates. Examples from each of the seven primate species included in our database illustrate the range of data incorporated and the challenges decision making processes and criteria applied to standardize data across diverse field studies. In addition to the descriptive and structural metadata associated with our database we also describe the process metadata (how the database was designed and delivered) and the technical specifications of the database. Our database provides a useful model for other researchers interested in developing similar types of databases for other organisms while our process metadata may be helpful to other groups of researchers interested in developing databases for other types of collaborative analyses. 1412:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,Cholera dynamics in endemic regions display regular seasonal cycles and pronounced interannual variability. We review here the current quantitative evidence for the influence of climate on cholera dynamics with reference to the early literature on the subject. We also briefly review the incipient status of mathematical models for cholera and argue that these models are important for understanding climatic influences in the context of the population dynamics of the disease. A better understanding of disease risk related to the environment should further underscore the need for changing the socioeconomic conditions conducive to cholera.1427:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Microgastrine wasps are among the most species rich and numerous parasitoids of caterpillars (Lepidoptera). They are often host specific and thus are extensively used in biological control efforts and figure prominently in trophic webs. However their extraordinary diversity coupled with the occurrence of many cryptic species produces a significant taxonomic impediment. We present and release the results of 8years (20042011) of DNA barcoding microgastrine wasps. Currently they are the best represented group of parasitoid Hymenoptera in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) a massive barcode storage and analysis data management site for the International Barcoding of Life (iBOL) program. There are records from more than 20000 specimens from 75 countries including 50 genera (90 PeRcEnT of the known total) and more than 1700 species (as indicated by Barcode Index Numbers and 2 PeRcEnT MOTU). We briefly discuss the importance of this DNA data set and its collateral information for future research in: (1) discovery of cryptic species and description of new taxa; (2) estimating species numbers in biodiversity inventories; (3) clarification of generic boundaries; (4) biological control programmes; (5) molecular studies of host parasitoid biology and ecology; (6) evaluation of shifts in species distribution and phenology; and (7) fostering collaboration at national regional and world levels. The integration of DNA barcoding with traditional morphology based taxonomy host records and other data has substantially improved the accuracy of microgastrine wasp identifications and will significantly accelerate further studies on this group of parasitoids. 1430:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The genus Symbiodinium encompasses a group of unicellular photosynthetic dinoflagellates that are found free living or in hospite with a wide range of marine invertebrate hosts including scleractinian corals. We present GeoSymbio a hybrid web application that provides an online easy to use and freely accessible interface for users to discover explore and utilize global geospatial bioinformatic and ecoinformatic data on Symbiodiniumhost symbioses. The novelty of this application lies in the combination of a variety of query and visualization tools including dynamic searchable maps data tables with filter and grouping functions and interactive charts that summarize the data. Importantly this application is hosted remotely or in the cloud using Google Apps and therefore does not require any specialty GIS web programming or data programming expertise from the user. The current version of the application utilizes Symbiodinium data based on the ITS2 genetic marker from PCR based techniques including denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis sequencing and cloning of specimens collected during 19822010. All data elements of the application are also downloadable as spatial files tables and nucleic acid sequence files in common formats for desktop analysis. The application provides a unique tool set to facilitate research on the basic biology of Symbiodinium and expedite new insights into their ecology biogeography and evolution in the face of a changing global climate. GeoSymbio can be accessed at . 1456:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although individual species persist within a web of interactions with other species data are usually gathered only from the focal species itself. We ask whether evidence of a species interactions be detected and understood from patterns in the dynamics of that species alone. Theory predicts that strong coupling between a prey and a specialist predator parasite should lead to an increase in the dimensionality of the preys dynamics whereas weak coupling should not. Here we describe a rare test of this prediction. Two natural enemies were added separately to replicate populations of a moth. For biological reasons that we identify here the prediction of increased dimensionality was confirmed when a parasitoid wasp was added (although this increase had subtleties not previously appreciated) but the prediction failed for an added virus. Thus an imprint of the interactions may be discerned within time series data from component species of a system. 1458:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Although vaccination has almost eliminated measles in parts of the world the disease remains a major killer in some high birth rate countries of the Sahel. On the basis of measles dynamics for industrialized countries high birth rate regions should experience regular annual epidemics. Here however we show that measles epidemics in Niger are highly episodic particularly in the capital Niamey. Models demonstrate that this variability arises from powerful seasonality in transmission generating high amplitude epidemics within the chaotic domain of deterministic dynamics. In practice this leads to frequent stochastic fadeouts interspersed with irregular large epidemics. A metapopulation model illustrates how increased vaccine coverage but still below the local elimination threshold could lead to increasingly variable major outbreaks in highly seasonally forced contexts. Such erratic dynamics emphasize the importance both of control strategies that address build up of susceptible individuals and efforts to mitigate the impact of large outbreaks when they occur. 1469:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In many infectious diseases an unknown fraction of infections produce symptoms mild enough to go unrecorded a fact that can seriously compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is true for cholera a pandemic bacterial disease where estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100 (refs 1 5). In the absence of direct evidence understanding of fundamental aspects of cholera transmission immunology and control has been based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity with infection both from human and environmental sources explains 50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal the pathogens endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses have indicated. We find too that the environmental reservoir(5 6) (free living pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but that it may be critical to the diseases endemicity. Our results demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods(7) which allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection seasonality process noise hidden variables and measurement error make it possible to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our experience suggests that the confrontation of time series data with mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology of many infectious diseases. 146:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mammals are exposed to a diverse array of parasites and infectious diseases many of which affect host survival and reproduction. Species that live in dense populations large social groups or with promiscuous mating systems may be especially vulnerable to infectious diseases owing to the close proximity and higher contact rates among individuals. We review the effects of host density and social contacts on parasite spread and the importance of promiscuity and mating structure for the spread and evolution of sexually transmitted diseases. Host social organization and mating system should influence not only parasite diversity and prevalence but may also determine the fitness advantages of different transmission strategies to parasites. Because host behavior and immune defenses may have evolved to reduce the spread and pathogenicity of infectious diseases we also consider selective pressures that parasites may exert on host social and mating behavior and the evolutionary responses of hosts at both the immunological and behavioral levels. In examining these issues we relate modeling results to observations from wild populations highlighting the similarities and differences among theoretical and empirical approaches. Finally the epidemiological consequences of host sociality are very relevant to the practical issues of conserving mammalian biodiversity and understanding the interactions between extinction risk and infectious diseases. 1479:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Spatio temporal travelling waves are striking manifestations of predator prey and host parasite dynamics. However few systems are well enough documented both to detect repeated waves and to explain their interaction with spatio temporal variations in population structure and demography. Here we demonstrate recurrent epidemic travelling waves in an exhaustive spatio temporal data set for measles in England and Wales. We use wavelet phase analysis which allows for dynamical nonstationarity a complication in interpreting spatio temporal patterns in these and many other ecological time series. In the prevaccination era conspicuous hierarchical waves of infection moved regionally from large cities to small towns; the introduction of measles vaccination restricted but did not eliminate this hierarchical contagion. A mechanistic stochastic model suggests a dynamical explanation for the waves spread via infective sparks from large core cities to smaller satellite towns. Thus the spatial hierarchy of host population structure is a prerequisite for these infection waves. 147:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many factors (climate warming pollution harvesting introduced species) can contribute to disease outbreaks in marine life. Concomitant increases in each of these makes it difficult to attribute recent changes in disease occurrence or severity to any one factor. For example the increase in disease of Caribbean coral is postulated to be a result of climate change and introduction of terrestrial pathogens. Indirect evidence exists that (a) warming increased disease in turtles; (b) protection pollution and terrestrial pathogens increased mammal disease; (c) aquaculture increased disease in mollusks; and (d) release from overfished predators increased sea urchin disease. In contrast fishing and pollution may have reduced disease in fishes. In other taxa  sea grasses crustaceans sharks) there is little evidence that disease has changed over time. The diversity of patterns suggests there are many ways that environmental change can interact with disease in the ocean. 1510:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, One way for animals to decrease energy expenditures is to minimize the cost of movement. For animals dwelling on slopes gravity can impart a large energetic cost to movement. For this reason animals traveling aboveground alter their movement patterns in response to the steepness of terrain (specifically hillslope angle) so as to minimize their energetic costs. Subterranean animals should also benefit from choosing optimum movement paths in relation to hillslopes but concurrently must factor the cost of excavation into their movement decisions. In cases where the excavation costs are much higher than the costs of working against gravity excavation costs may override the consideration of gravitational costs and movement of subterranean animals may be independent of hillslope angle. To determine the response of a subterranean animal to hillslope angle we excavated tunnels in the burrow systems of 19 pocket gophers in southern California that occupied hillslopes ranging from 2 to 30 degrees. At each excavation we measured several characteristics of burrow geometry and used these data in a model of pocket gopher energetics to calculate the cost of tunnel construction at the various hillslope angles. We found that the cost of tunnel construction was independent of hillslope angle and that the costs of shearing soil and pushing soil horizontally through the tunnels were 3 orders of magnitude greater than the costs of lifting the soil against the force of gravity. Accordingly pocket gopher foraging tunnels were oriented independently of the hillslope. The decoupling of the movement patterns of subterranean animals from the effects of gravity is a distinctive feature of the subterranean habit compared to the movement of above ground animals. Because of the important effects of tunnel construction on soil processes this unique biological feature of subterranean animals has implications for basic physical processes such as soil erosion. We found that the rate of soil flux generated by pocket gopher activity was invariant to hillslope. This relationship is in contrast to the most common model of soil movement generated by purely physical processes. 154:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1641:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Thanks to recent technological advances it is now possible to track with an unprecedented precision and for long periods of time the movement patterns of many living organisms in their habitat. The increasing amount of data available on single trajectories offers the possibility of understanding how animals move and of testing basic movement models. Random walks have long represented the main description for micro organisms and have also been useful to understand the foraging behaviour of large animals. Nevertheless most vertebrates in particular humans and other primates rely on sophisticated cognitive tools such as spatial maps episodic memory and travel cost discounting. These properties call for other modelling approaches of mobility patterns. We propose a foraging framework where a learning mobile agent uses a combination of memory based and random steps. We investigate how advantageous it is to use memory for exploiting resources in heterogeneous and changing environments. An adequate balance of determinism and random exploration is found to maximize the foraging efficiency and to generate trajectories with an intricate spatio temporal order where travel routes emerge without multi step planning. Based on this approach we propose some tools for analysing the non random nature of mobility patterns in general. 1677:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The availability of epidemiological data in the early stages of an outbreak of an infectious disease is vital for modelers to make accurate predictions regarding the likely spread of disease and preferred intervention strategies. However in some countries the necessary demographic data are only available at an aggregate scale. We investigated the ability of models of livestock infectious diseases to predict epidemic spread and obtain optimal control policies in the event of imperfect aggregated data. Taking a geographic information approach we used land cover data to predict UK farm locations and investigated the influence of using these synthetic location data sets upon epidemiological predictions in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. When broadly classified land cover data were used to create synthetic farm locations model predictions deviated significantly from those simulated on true data. However when more resolved subclass land use data were used moderate to highly accurate predictions of epidemic size duration and optimal vaccination and ring culling strategies were obtained. This suggests that a geographic information approach may be useful where individual farm level data are not available to allow predictive analyses to be carried out regarding the likely spread of disease. This method can also be used for contingency planning in collaboration with policy makers to determine preferred control strategies in the event of a future outbreak of infectious disease in livestock. 1678:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, There is growing interest in understanding the nature and consequences of interactions among infectious agents. Pathogen interactions can be operational at different scales either within a co infected host or in host populations where they co circulate and can be either cooperative or competitive. The detection of interactions among pathogens has typically involved the study of synchrony in the oscillations of the protagonists but as we show here phase association provides an unreliable dynamical fingerprint for this task. We assess the capacity of a likelihood based inference framework to accurately detect and quantify the presence and nature of pathogen interactions on the basis of realistic amounts and kinds of simulated data. We show that when epidemiological and demographic processes are well understood noisy time series data can contain sufficient information to allow correct inference of interactions in multi pathogen systems. The inference power is dependent on the strength and time course of the underlying mechanism: stronger and longer lasting interactions are more easily and more precisely quantified. We examine the limitations of our approach to stochastic temporal variation under reporting and over aggregation of data. We propose that likelihood shows promise as a basis for detection and quantification of the effects of pathogen interactions and the determination of their (competitive or cooperative) nature on the basis of population level time series data. 1679:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Meningococcal meningitis in western Africa shows recurrent seasonal patterns every year. Epidemics typically start at the beginning of February and last until May. We can try to explain the observed patterns on the basis of some seasonally varying environmental factor that favors disease transmission. Air dryness produced by strong dust winds is the most likely candidate. But while there are qualitative stories of this kind in the literature for many seasonal phenomena convincing quantitative evidence to support them remains largely elusive. Instead we tend to see weak associations between environmental and transmission variables when measured by simple linear correlations. The study of meningococcal meningitis in Mali by Sultan and colleagues in this issue of PLoS Medicine is a remarkable exception. The study reports a strong association between the yearly onset of epidemics and a large scale regional index for atmospheric circulation related to the Harmattan winds in Sahelo Sudanian Africa. 1680:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Early warning systems for outbreaks of infectious diseases are an important application of the ecological theory of epidemics. A key variable predicted by early warning systems is the final outbreak size. However for directly transmitted diseases the stochastic contact process by which outbreaks develop entails fundamental limits to the precision with which the final size can be predicted. I studied how the expected final outbreak size and the coefficient of variation in the final size of outbreaks scale with control effectiveness and the rate of infectious contacts in the simple stochastic epidemic. As examples I parameterized this model with data on observed ranges for the basic reproductive ratio (R 0) of nine directly transmitted diseases. I also present results from a new model the simple stochastic epidemic with delayed onset intervention in which an initially supercritical outbreak (R 0   1) is brought under control after a delay. The coefficient of variation of final outbreak size in the subcritical case (R 0   1) will be greater than one for any outbreak in which the removal rate is less than approximately 2.41 times the rate of infectious contacts implying that for many transmissible diseases precise forecasts of the final outbreak size will be unattainable. In the delayed onset model the coefficient of variation (CV) was generally large (CV   1) and increased with the delay between the start of the epidemic and intervention and with the average outbreak size. These results suggest that early warning systems for infectious diseases should not focus exclusively on predicting outbreak size but should consider other characteristics of outbreaks such as the timing of disease emergence. 1686:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  The spread of infectious diseases in wildlife populations is influenced by patterns of between host contacts. Habitat   hotspots places attracting a large numbers of individuals or social groups can significantly alter contact patterns and hence disease propagation. Research on the importance of habitat hotspots in wildlife epidemiology has primarily focused on how inter individual contacts occurring at the hotspot itself increase disease transmission. However in territorial animals epidemiologically important contacts may primarily occur as animals cross through territories of conspecifics en route to habitat hotspots. So far the phenomenon has received little attention. Here we investigate the importance of these contacts in the case where infectious individuals keep visiting the hotspots and in the case where these individuals are not able to travel to the hotspot any more. We developed a simulation epidemiological model to investigate both cases in a scenario when transmission at the hotspot does not occur. We find that (i) hotspots still exacerbate epidemics (ii) when infectious individuals do not travel to the hotspot the most vulnerable individuals are those residing at intermediate distances from the hotspot rather than nearby and (iii) the epidemiological vulnerability of a population is the highest when the number of hotspots is intermediate. By altering animal movements in their vicinity habitat hotspots can thus strongly increase the spread of infectious diseases even when disease transmission does not occur at the hotspot itself. Interestingly when animals only visit the nearest hotspot creating additional artificial hotspots rather than reducing their number may be an efficient disease control measure. 1690:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529,  Rapid response to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases is impeded by uncertain diagnoses and delayed communication. Understanding the effect of inefficient response is a potentially important contribution of epidemic theory. To develop this understanding we studied societal learning during emerging outbreaks wherein patient removal accelerates as information is gathered and disseminated. We developed an extension of a standard outbreak model the simple stochastic epidemic which accounts for societal learning. We obtained expressions for the expected outbreak size and the distribution of epidemic duration. We found that rapid learning noticeably affects the final outbreak size even when learning exhibits diminishing returns (relaxation). As an example we estimated the learning rate for the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore. Evidence for relaxation during the first eight weeks of the outbreak was inconclusive. We estimated that if societal learning had occurred at half the actual rate the expected final size of the outbreak would have reached nearly 800 cases more than three times the observed number of infections. By contrast the expected outbreak size for societal learning twice as effective was 116 cases. These results show that the rate of societal learning can greatly affect the final size of disease outbreaks justifying investment in early warning systems and attentiveness to disease outbreak by both government authorities and the public. We submit that the burden of emerging infections including the risk of a global pandemic could be efficiently reduced by improving procedures for rapid detection of outbreaks alerting public health officials and aggressively educating the public at the start of an outbreak. 1692:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Catastrophic declines in African great ape populations due to disease outbreaks have been reported in recent years yet we rarely hear of similar disease impacts for the more solitary Asian great apes or for smaller primates. We used an age structured model of different primate social systems to illustrate that interactions between social structure and demography create dynamic constraints on the pathogens that can establish and persist in primate host species with different social systems. We showed that this varies by disease transmission mode. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) require high rates of transmissibility to persist within a primate population. In particular for a unimale social system STIs require extremely high rates of transmissibility for persistence and remain at extremely low prevalence in small primates but this is less constrained in longer lived larger bodied primates. In contrast aerosol transmitted infections (ATIs) spread and persist at high prevalence in medium and large primates with moderate transmissibility; establishment and persistence in small bodied primates require higher relative rates of transmissibility. Intragroup contact structure the social network creates different constraints for different transmission modes and our model underscores the importance of intragroup contacts on infection prior to intergroup movement in a structured population. When alpha males dominate sexual encounters the resulting disease transmission dynamics differ from when social interactions are dominated by mother infant grooming events for example. This has important repercussions for pathogen spread across populations. Our framework reveals essential social and demographic characteristics of primates that predispose them to different disease risks that will be important for disease management and conservation planning for protected primate populations. 1698:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Infectious disease has recently joined poaching and habitat loss as a major threat to African apes. Both   naturally   occurring pathogens such as Ebola and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) and respiratory pathogens transmitted from humans have been confirmed as important sources of mortality in wild gorillas and chimpanzees. While awareness of the threat has increased interventions such as vaccination and treatment remain controversial. Here we explore both the risk of disease to African apes and the status of potential responses. Through synthesis of published data we summarize prior disease impact on African apes. We then use a simple demographic model to illustrate the resilience of a well known gorilla population to disease modeled on prior documented outbreaks. We found that the predicted recovery time for this specific gorilla population from a single outbreak ranged from 5 years for a low mortality (4 PeRcEnT) respiratory outbreak to 131 years for an Ebola outbreak that killed 96 PeRcEnT of the population. This shows that mortality rates comparable to those recently reported for disease outbreaks in wild populations are not sustainable. This is particularly troubling given the rising pathogen risk created by increasing habituation of wild apes for tourism and the growth of human populations surrounding protected areas. We assess potential future disease spillover risk in terms of vaccination rates amongst humans that may come into contact with wild apes and the availability of vaccines against potentially threatening diseases. We discuss and evaluate non interventionist responses such as limiting tourist access to apes community health programs and safety logistic and cost issues that constrain the potential of vaccination. 1702:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Most reef building corals in the order Scleractinia depend on endosymbiotic algae in the genus Symbiodinium for energy and survival. Significant levels of taxonomic diversity in both partners result in numerous possible combinations of coral Symbiodinium associations with unique functional characteristics. We created and analyzed the first coral Symbiodinium networks utilizing a global dataset of interaction records from coral reefs in the tropical Indo Pacific and Atlantic Oceans for 1991 to 2010. Our meta analysis reveals that the majority of coral species and Symbiodinium types are specialists but failed to detect any one to one obligate relationships. Symbiont specificity is correlated with a hosts transmission mode with horizontally transmitting corals being more likely to interact with generalist symbionts. Globally Symbiodinium types tend to interact with only vertically or horizontally transmitting corals and only a few generalist types are found with both. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between symbiont specificity symbiont transmission mode and community partitioning. The structure and dynamics of these network interactions underlie the fundamental biological partnership that determines the condition and resilience of coral reef ecosystems. 1706:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Recent infectious disease models illustrate a suite of mechanisms that can result in lower incidence of disease in areas of higher disease host diversity the dilution effect. These models are particularly applicable to human zoonoses which are infectious diseases of wildlife that spill over into human populations. As many recent emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses the mechanisms that underlie the dilution effect are potentially widely applicable and could contribute greatly to our understanding of a suite of diseases. The dilution effect has largely been observed in the context of Lyme disease and the predictions of the underlying models have rarely been examined for other infectious diseases on a broad geographic scale. Here we explored whether the dilution effect can be observed in the relationship between the incidence of human West Nile virus (WNV) infection and bird (host) diversity in the eastern US. We constructed a novel geospatial contrasts analysis that compares the small differences in avian diversity of neighboring US counties (where one county reported human cases of WNV and the other reported no cases) with associated between county differences in human disease. We also controlled for confounding factors of climate regional variation in mosquito vector type urbanization and human socioeconomic factors that are all likely to affect human disease incidence. We found there is lower incidence of human WNV in eastern US counties that have greater avian (viral host) diversity. This pattern exists when examining diversity disease relationships both before WNV reached the US (in 1998) and once the epidemic was underway ( in 2002). The robust disease diversity relationships confirm that the dilution effect can be observed in another emerging infectious disease and illustrate an important ecosystem service provided by biodiversity further supporting the growing view that protecting biodiversity should be considered in public health and safety plans. 1714:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The gypsy moth has been present in North America for more than 100 years and in many of the areas where it has become established outbreaks occur with varying degrees of periodicity. There also exists extensive spatial synchrony in the onset of outbreaks over large geographic regions. Density dependent mortality clearly limits high density populations but there is little evidence for strong regulation of low density populations. Predation by small mammals appears to be the major source of mortality affecting low density populations. but because these are generalist predators and gypsy moths are a less preferred food item mammals do not appear to regulate populations in a density dependent fashion. Instead predation levels appear to be primarily determined by small mammal abundance which is in turn closely linked to the production of acorns that are a major source of food for overwintering predator populations. Mast production by host oak trees is typically variable among years but considerable spatial synchrony in masting exists over large geographic areas. Thus it appears that the temporal and spatial patterns of mast production may be responsible for the episodic and spatially synchronous behavior of gypsy moth outbreaks in North America. This multitrophic relationship among mast predators and gypsy moths represents a very different explanation of forest insect outbreak dynamics than the more widely applied theories based upon predator prey cycles or feedbacks with host foliage quality. 1717:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Rabies is the only pathogen to play a role in a Disney movie. While defending the children who costar in the 1957 film against a rabid coyote the canine hero of Old Yeller is bitten and acquires the infection. Eventually Old Yeller becomes rabid and moves on to the great casting kennel in the sky and a younger understudy then helps to placate the mortified children. If Disney were to remake the film they might have to replace canine rabies with raccoon rabies which is now the major strain of rabies in the United States; more than 85 PeRcEnT of the rabies cases currently recorded in the United States are reported from raccoons. Most of these are from a strain of rabies that continues to expand its geographical distribution. This rabies strain was given a new lease on life in 1976 when Jimmy Carter was elected to the United States presidency. As several members of Carters cabinet and personal staff missed going coon hunting over the weekend they had some raccoons imported into Virginia from Georgia. The strain of rabies that came with these raccoons initiated an outbreak of rabies in the local raccoon population that has been steadily expanding ever since predominantly in a northeasterly direction. The annual United States budget to control rabies is  DoLlQuAnT 300 million; a further  DoLlQuAnT 15 million is spent annually on postexposure prophylactic treatment of the 18 000 to 20 000 people who are exposed each year. Understanding the spatial spread and local dynamics of an infectious disease such as rabies is central to the design of control strategies for introduced infectious diseases. The paper by Childs provides important new insights into the mechanisms that determine the rate of spread of raccoon rabies. As recently as 1997 Mark Wilson pointed out that 25 years after the current epidemic began there were still fundamental gaps in our understanding of raccoon rabies epidemiology. Centrally there was no knowledge of how transmission occurs between raccoons although this is widely acknowledged to be by bites and there was a belief that significant numbers of raccoons developed immunity to infection. This was based on serology data suggesting that around 20 PeRcEnT of raccoons test positive for rabies. The paper by Childs . suggests that the development of immunity to rabies is rare in raccoons__as few as 1 5 PeRcEnT of exposed raccoons develop immunity. The work reported in the paper by Childs . depends very much on data and information provided by the general public; it is an excellent example of citizen science. More than 50 000 cases of rabies have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta since 1980. The collation of the major subset of these data which deal only with raccoon rabies forms the basis for an analysis that illustrates consistent changes in the amplitude and frequency of rabies epidemics after the initial arrival of the infective wave front. In all counties where multiple epidemics of raccoon rabies have occurred the number of reported infected raccoons in the first outbreak exceeds that in the second outbreak by a factor of three. There are then around 25 PeRcEnT more cases in the second than the third epidemic. Concomitant with this the interepidemic period shortens from around 45 months between the first and second epidemic to 40 months and then by an average of 5.3 months between each subsequent epidemic. This shortening of the interepidemic period would not occur if a significant proportion of raccoons developed immunity on exposure to rabies. The epizootic of raccoon rabies has spread in a northeasterly direction at an annual rate of 30 50 km year. Plainly the logical next step in this work will be to produce a spatial model and to examine whether it is possible to produce a cordon sanitaire that might reduce the further spatial spread of the pathogen. The rate of spread is comparable to the spread of canine rabies in Europe the current epidemic of which started in Poland at the end of World War II. This epidemic has been successfully controlled by using a vaccine that is introduced to the fox population through artificial food supplements. Specifically chicken heads are laced with the vaccine and regularly deposited in areas where foxes are likely to locate and eat them. A significant level of success was achieved here by focusing control efforts around the mouths of mountain valleys. Fox dispersal activities tend to bottleneck into these locations so a significant proportion of the local population may be treated while focusing the control activities into a comparatively restricted geographical location. Unfortunately the landscape of the eastern United States is considerably less mountainous that that of central Europe. Although large rivers have slowed the spread of raccoon rabies in the northeastern United States these halts have been only temporary usually 4 8 months; raccoons are as adept as humans at using bridges. This suggests that if a vaccine becomes available bridges might be used as bottlenecks in the same way as valleys were used in Europe. Before the development of a successful fox rabies vaccine there was considerable speculation on how far rabies might spread in Europe. This speculation led to the development of a number of mathematical models for the dispersal of rabies in wildlife. These models ranged from relatively general stochastic models to more explicitly spatial deterministic models that could be used to examine the likely behavior of rabies should it enter a country with a large fox population and no previous history of rabies such as the United Kingdom. Several important epidemiological principles emerged from this earlier work on spatial epidemics: Murray and colleagues pathbreaking work illustrated the power of diffusion models and led to a need to understand the dynamics of pathogens in the troughs between epidemics. The stochastic work of Mollison . emphasized the importance of local contact processes in determining larger scale transmission patterns. This work also identified the potential appearance of great leaps forward the sudden appearance of infected individuals at points well ahead of the current epidemic wave front. In rabies this occurs when infected humans move animals either actively or passively. The raccoons moved to Virginia in the 1970s are a good example of the former. Detailed studies of the rabies epidemics in Connecticut and Massachusetts revealed that an occasional great leap forward occurred when raccoons hitched rides in the back of garbage trucks. There are at least two other epizootics spreading through the wildlife of the northeastern United States. A recent paper in PNAS by Andre Dhondt and colleagues reports on the impact of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in house finches. This pathogen is spreading north and west from its point of origin in Baltimore while Lyme disease continues to spread south and west from its initially reported location in Old Lyme CT. The work on mycoplasmal conjunctivitis provides a particularly important comparison as this pathogen is directly transmitted and produces a significant decrease in local abundance once the epidemic wave front has passed through an area. In contrast to rabies the spatial spread of the pathogen seems to occur more rapidly whereas the local dynamics change on a slower time scale. The faster rates of spatial spread reflect the larger distances that infected birds move particularly on their annual migration when birds from the northeastern United States may move as far as Texas and other parts of southern United States. The slower local dynamics presumably reflect lower transmission and virulence rates of mycoplasma when compared with rabies. Over a 2 3 year time period these produce a steady decline in the local host abundance to around 40 PeRcEnT of their density in the absence of the pathogen. An interesting similarity between Lyme disease and raccoon rabies is that spread in a southerly direction is slower than spread in any other direction. In a recent paper in Conservation Biology Richard Ostfeld and Felicia Keesing propose that increased biological diversity may buffer local outbreaks of Lyme disease. This predominantly occurs when the ticks that vector the pathogen waste bite on hosts in which the pathogen cannot develop. As the tick will take only a finite number of bites within its lifetime these wasted bites reduce the rate of spread of the pathogen. As the diversity of wrong hosts increases in the warmer southern states this effect has the potential to slow the spread of Lyme disease. But why should we observe similar slower rates of spread in the case of raccoon rabies? In contrast to Lyme disease rabies is directly transmitted so it unlikely that transmission will saturate. Perhaps raccoon abundance declines in the southern part of their range; this would also cause a decline in the rate of spread of the pathogen. But if this were the case why were Jimmy Carters colleagues dissatisfied with the quality of coon hunting in the Washington DC vicinity? Hopefully future studies of all three pathogens will allow us to address questions that examine how host species diversity effects pathogen dynamics. If other pathogens are likely to expand their geographical range in a warmer world it will be very important to understand the role that biological diversity might play in buffering disease outbreaks. The current state of the art in our understanding of the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases comes from Bryan Grenfell and colleagues work on measles. These studies build on the pioneering earlier work of Anderson and May and Andy Cliff . who have undertaken pathbreaking work on measles in both Iceland and the United States. In contrast to the three cases described above all of which occurred in situations where a pathogen has been recently introduced into a host population measles has been present in Britain for several hundred years. Grenfell and colleagues work has tracked the history of measles in the villages towns and cities of England and Wales since 1944. The data are particularly rich as measles is a notifiable disease in Britain; each case has to be reported to the national medical authorities by the doctor who treats it. Grenfell has collected weekly data from 1940 to the present. These data are bisected by the crucial time period in the late 1960s when mass vaccination to control measles was first introduced. The analyses by Grenfell illustrate the importance of large scale data sets in determining the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases. Before the advent of mass vaccination measles was always present in Britains larger cities: London Birmingham Leeds Liverpool and Manchester. The biennial epidemics observed in these cities spawned epidemics in the surrounding towns and villages that were too small to constantly maintain measles infection. A computer movie of the measles epidemics reveals waves of infection spreading out from the large cities and interfering with waves spreading from other cities. Although most of the larger cities are fairly tightly coupled together the higher birthrates observed in Liverpool (a predominantly Catholic city) tend to keep it slightly out of phase with the other cities. After the advent of mass vaccination the epidemics are less regular and more chaotic in nature. The large cities are less tightly coupled together and the spatial distribution of smaller towns and villages is more important in maintaining the pathogen in the troughs between epidemics. In contrast to measles epidemic outbreaks of pertussis (whooping cough) were more synchronized after mass vaccination. This is thought to be because the longer period of infection of pertussis reduces the significance of seasonal forcing before vaccination. Once vaccination was introduced in 1957 this perturbation throughout the country raised the average age of vaccination and synchronized lots of local dynamics that could then be weakly synchronized by low levels of seasonal forcing that are mainly superimposed by school terms. Local population dynamics and spatial spread of infectious diseases are exciting areas of scientific research with important public health implications. The paper by Childs . adds important detail to a larger synthesis that is emerging from studies of infectious diseases in both humans and wildlife. These studies will be become increasingly important in forecasting the spread and outbreaks of infectious diseases. 1750:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Mathematical models have been developed to explore the population dynamics of viral diseases among wildlife. However assessing the predictions stemming from these models with wildlife databases adequate in size and temporal duration is uncommon. An epizootic of raccoon rabies that began in the mid Atlantic region of the United States in the late 1970s has developed into one of the largest and most extensive in the history of wildlife rabies. We analyzed the dynamics of local epizootics at the county level by examining a database spanning more than 20 years and including 35 387 rabid raccoons The size number and periodicity of rabies epizootics among raccoons were compared with predictions derived from a susceptible exposed infectious and recovered model of raccoon rabies Coyne J. Smith G. and McAllister F. E. (1989) Am. J. Vet Res 50 2148 2154 . After our methods for defining epizootics were applied to solutions of the model the time series revealed recurrent epizootics in some counties with a median first epizootic period of 48 months. Successive epizootics declined in size and the epizootic period progressively decreased. Our reanalysis of the model predicted the initial epizootic period of 4 5 years with a progressive dampening of epizootic size and progressive decrease in epizootic period. The best quantitative agreement between data and model assumed low levels of immunity (1 5 PeRcEnT) within raccoon populations suggesting that raccoons develop little or no rabies immune class. These results encourage the use of data obtained through wildlife surveillance in assessing and refining epidemic models for wildlife diseases. 1757:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Often as an epidemic spreads the leading front is irregular reflecting spatial variation in local transmission rates. We developed a methodology for quantifying spatial variation in rates of disease spread across heterogeneous landscapes. Based on data for epidemic raccoon rabies in Connecticut we developed a stochastic spatial model of rabies spread through the states 169 townships. We quantified spatial variation in transmission rates associated with human demography and key habitat features. We found that large rivers act as semipermeable barriers leading to a 7 fold reduction in the local rates of propagation. By combining the spatial distribution of major rivers with long distance dispersal we were able to account for the observed irregular pattern of disease spread across the state without recourse to direct assessment of host pathogen populations. 1793:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Directly transmitted infectious diseases spread through wildlife populations as travelling waves away from the sites of original introduction. These waves often become distorted through their interaction with environmental and population heterogeneities and by long distance translocation of infected individuals. Accurate a priori predictions of travelling waves of infection depend upon understanding and quantifying these distorting factors. We assess the effects of anisotropies arising from the orientation of rivers in relation to the direction of disease front propagation and the damming effect of mountains on disease movement in natural populations. The model successfully predicts the local and large scale prevaccination spread of raccoon rabies through New York State based on a previous spatially heterogeneous model of raccoon rabies invasion across the state of Connecticut. Use of this model provides a rare example of a priori prediction of an epidemic invasion over a naturally heterogeneous landscape. Model predictions matched to data can also be used to evaluate the most likely points of disease introduction. These results have general implications for predicting future pathogen invasions and evaluating potential containment strategies. 1797:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Habitat loss and the resultant fragmentation of remaining habitat is the primary cause of loss of biological diversity. How do these processes affect the dynamics of parasites and pathogens? Hess has provided some important insights into this problem using metapopulation models for pathogens that exhibit S I dynamics; for example pathogens such as rabies in which the host population may be divided into susceptible and infected individuals. A major assumption of Hesss models is that infected patches become extinct rather than recovering and becoming resistant to future infections. In this paper we build upon this framework in two different ways: first we examine the consequences of including patches that are resistant to infection; second we examine the consequences of including a second species of host that can act as a reservoir for the pathogen. Both of these effects are likely to be important from a conservation perspective. The results of both sets of analysis indicate that the benefits of corridors and other connections that allow species to disperse through the landscape far outweigh the possible risks of increased pathogen transmission. Even in the commonest case where harmful pathogens are maintained by a common reservoir host increased landscape connectance still allows greater coexistence and persistence of a threatened or endangered host. 1799:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In natural systems host species are often co infected by multiple pathogen species and recent work has suggested that many pathogens can infect a wide range of host species. An important question therefore is what determines the host range of a pathogen and the community of pathogens found within a given host species. Using primates as a model we show that infectious diseases are more often shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographical region. We find that host relatedness is the best overall predictor of whether two host species share the same pathogens. A higher frequency of pathogen host shifts between close relatives or inheritance of pathogens from a common ancestor may explain this result. For viruses geographical overlap among neighbouring primate hosts is more important in determining host range. We suggest this is because rapid evolution within viral lineages allows host jumps across larger evolutionary distances. We also show that the phylogenetic pattern of pathogen sharing with humans is the same as that between wild primates. For humans this means we share a higher proportion of pathogens with the great apes including chimpanzees and gorillas because these species are our closest relatives. 1800:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In primates baseline levels of white blood cell (WBC) counts are related to mating promiscuity. It was hypothesized that differences in the primate immune system reflect pathogen risks from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Here we test for the generality of this result by examining hypotheses involving behavioural ecological and life history factors in carnivores. Again we find a significant correlation in carnivores between mating promiscuity and elevated levels of WBC counts. In addition we find relationships with measures of sociality substrate use and life history parameters. These comparative results across independent taxonomic orders indicate that the evolution of the immune system as represented by phylogenetic differences in basal levels of blood cell counts is closely linked to disease risk involved with promiscuous mating and associated variables. We found only limited support for an association between the percentage of meat in the diet and WBC counts which is consistent with the behavioural and physiological mechanisms that carnivores use to avoid parasite transmission from their prey. We discuss additional comparative questions related to taxonomic differences in disease risk modes of parasite transmission and implications for conservation biology. 1803:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Insight into the dynamics of parasite host relationships of higher vertebrates requires an understanding of two important features: the nature of transmission and the development of acquired immunity in the host. A dominant hypothesis proposes that acquired immunity develops with the cumulative exposure to infection and consequently predicts a negative relationship between peak intensity of infection and host age at this peak. Although previous studies have found evidence to support this hypothesis through between population comparisons these results are confounded by spatial effects. In this study we examined the dynamics of infection of the nematode Trichostrongylus retortaeformis within a natural population of rabbits sampled monthly for 26 years. The rabbit age structure was reconstructed using body mass as a proxy for age and the host age parasite intensity relationship was examined for each rabbit cohort born from February to August. The age intensity curves exhibited a typical concave shape and a significant negative relationship was found between peak intensity of infection and host age at this peak. Adult females showed a distinct periparturient rise in T retortaeformis infection with higher intensities in breeding adult females than adult males and non breeding females. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of an acquired immune response of the host to a parasite infection supporting the principle that acquired immunity can be modelled using the cumulative exposure to infection. These findings also show that seasonality can be an important driver of host parasite interactions. 1809:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many diverse infectious diseases exhibit seasonal dynamics. Seasonality in disease incidence has been attributed to seasonal changes in pathogen transmission rates resulting from fluctuations in extrinsic climate factors. Multi strain infectious diseases with strain specific seasonal signatures such as cholera indicate that a range of seasonal patterns in transmission rates is possible in identical environments. We therefore consider pathogens capable of evolving their seasonal phenotype a trait that determines the sensitivity of their transmission rates to environmental variability. We introduce a theoretical framework based on adaptive dynamics for predicting the evolution of disease dynamics in seasonal environments. Changes in the seasonality of environmental factors are one important avenue for the effects of climate change on disease. This model also provides a framework for examining these effects on pathogen evolution and associated disease dynamics. An application of this approach gives an explanation for the recent cholera strain replacement in Bangladesh based on changes in monsoon rainfall patterns. 1825:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The latent prevalence of a long lived and common brain parasite Toxoplasma gondii explains a statistically significant portion of the variance in aggregate neuroticisin among populations as well as in the neurotic cultural dimensions of sex roles and uncertainty avoidance. Spurious or non causal correlations between aggregate personality and aspects of climate and culture that influence T gondii transmission could also drive these patterns. A link between culture and T gondii hypothetically results from a behavioural manipulation that the parasite uses to increase its transmission to the next host in the life cycle: a cat. While latent toxoplasmosis is usually benign the parasites subtle effect on individual personality appears to alter the aggregate personality at the population level. Drivers of the geographical variation in the prevalence of this parasite include the effects of climate on the persistence of infectious stages in soil the cultural practices of food preparation and cats as pets. Some variation in culture therefore may ultimately be related to how climate affects the distribution of T gondii though the results only explain a fraction of the variation in two of the four cultural dimensions suggesting that if T gondii does influence human culture it is only one among many factors. 1831:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We examine the role of host seasonal breeding host seasonal social aggregation and partial immunity in affecting wildlife disease dynamics focusing on the dynamics of house finch conjunctivitis (Mycoplasma gallisepticurn (MG) in Carpodacus mexicanus). This case study of an unmanaged emerging infectious disease provides useful insight into the important role of seasonal factors in driving ongoing disease dynamics. Seasonal breeding can force recurrent epidemics through the input of fresh susceptibles which will clearly affect a wide variety of wildlife disease dynamics. Seasonal patterns of social aggregation and foraging behaviour could change transmission dynamics. We use latitudinal variation in the timing of breeding and social systems to model seasonal dynamics of house finch conjunctivitis across eastern North America. We quantify the patterns of seasonal breeding and social aggregation across a latitudinal gradient in the eastern range of the house finch supplemented with known field and laboratory information on immunity to MG in finches. We then examine the interactions of these factors in a theoretical model of disease dynamics. We find that both forms of seasonality could explain the dynamics of the house finch MG system and that these factors could have important effects on the dynamics of wildlife diseases generally. In particular while either alone is sufficient to create recurrent cycles of prevalence in a population with an endemic disease both are required to produce the specific semi annual pattern of disease prevalence seen in the house finch conjunctivitis system. 184:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,1853:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, In an insect host (the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus) parasitoid (Heterospilus prosopidis) experimental system the population densities of the component species oscillated for the first 20 generations and then abruptly stabilized as the parasitoid density decreased. Examination of the host and parasitoid after the 40th generation in the long term experiment showed that (1) host larvae exhibited contest type competition (killing other larvae inhabiting the same bean) in contrast to the founder population being scramble type competitors and (2) the parasitoid attack rate on the host did not change. There was also an evolutionary trade off between body size and the rates of larval survival and development suggesting a cost of contest competition on larval survivorship and development. I tested model predictions (Tuda and Iwasa 1998) that (1) host equilibrium population size should gradually decrease as the proportion of the contest type increases and that (2) random attacks of the parasitoid on the host should reduce the rate of increase in proportion of the contest type and the effect should become manifest especially during the first 20 generations. Two of three host only replicates showed significant decrease in population sizes. Although the density of emerging adults per bean did not differ between replicates of the host only and host parasitoid systems comparison of the host body size between them on day 270 (at the 13th generation) showed that the host was more contest type in the host only system than in the host parasitoid system as the model predicted and later on day 650 the effect of the parasitoid had disappeared. 1857:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The role of evolutionary dynamics in understanding host parasitoid interactions is interlinked with the population dynamics of these interactions. Here we address the problems in coupling evolutionary and population dynamics of host parasitoid interactions. We review previous theoretical and empirical studies and show that evolution can alter the ecological dynamics of a host parasitoid interaction. Whether evolution stabilizes or destabilizes the interaction depends on the direction of evolutionary changes which are affected by ecological physiological and genetic details of the insect biology. We examine the effect of life history correlations on population persistence and stability embedding two types one of which is competitively inferior but superior in encapsulation (for parasitoid virulence) in a Nicholson Bailey model with intraspecific resource competition for host. If a trade off exists between intraspecific competitive ability and encapsulation (or virulence as a countermeasure) in both the host and parasitoid the trade off or even positive correlation in the parasitoid is less influential to ecological stability than the trade off in the host. We comment on the bearing this work has on the broader issues of understanding host parasitoid interactions. including long term biological control. 1923:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Animal migrations are often spectacular and migratory species harbor zoonotic pathogens of importance to humans. Animal migrations are expected to enhance the global spread of pathogens and facilitate cross species transmission. This does happen but new research has also shown that migration allows hosts to escape from infected habitats reduces disease levels when infected animals do not migrate successfully and may lead to the evolution of less virulent pathogens. Migratory demands can also reduce immune function with consequences for host susceptibility and mortality. Studies of pathogen dynamics in migratory species and how these will respond to global change are urgently needed to predict future disease risks for wildlife and humans alike. 1947:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Infectious diseases can cause rapid population declines or species extinctions. Many pathogens of terrestrial and marine taxa are sensitive to temperature rainfall and humidity creating synergisms that could affect biodiversity. Climate warming can increase pathogen development and survival rates disease transmission and host susceptibility. Although most host parasite systems are predicted to experience more frequent or severe disease impacts with warming a subset of pathogens might decline with warming releasing hosts from disease. Recently changes in El Nino Southern Oscillation events have had a detectable influence on marine and terrestrial pathogens including coral diseases oyster pathogens crop pathogens Rift Valley fever and human cholera. To improve our ability to predict epidemics in wild populations it will be necessary to separate the independent and interactive effects of multiple climate drivers on disease impact. 1976:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Over 20 000 years ago equids were among the most abundant and ecologically important herbivores on the grassland of Africa Asia and the Americas.

To explore the value of citations the reported efficacy of treatments in ecology and evolution from close to 1 500 publications was examined. If citation behavior is rationale studies that successfully applied a treatment and detected greater biological effects are cited more frequently then we predict that larger effect sizes increases study relative citation rates. This prediction was not supported. Citations are likely thus a poor proxy for the quantitative merit of a given treatment in ecology and evolutionary biology unlike evidence based medicine wherein the success of a drug or treatment on human health is one of the critical attributes. Impact factor of the journal is a broader metric as one would expect but it also unrelated to the mean effect sizes for the respective populations of publications. The interpretation by the authors of the treatment effects within each study differed depending on whether the hypothesis was supported or rejected. Significantly larger effect sizes were associated with rejection of a hypothesis. This suggests that only the most rigorous studies reporting negative results are published or that authors set a higher burden of proof in rejecting a hypothesis. The former is likely true to a major extent since only 29 PeRcEnT of the studies rejected the hypotheses tested. These findings indicate that the use of citations to identify important papers in this specific discipline at least in terms of designing a new experiment or contrasting treatments is of limited value. 2016:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, This paper describes the results of 5 years of research on interactive effects of mixtures of aldicarb atrazine and nitrate on endocrine immune and nervous system function. The concentrations of chemicals used were the same order of magnitude as current maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for all three compounds. Such levels occur in groundwater across the United States. Dosing was through voluntary consumption of drinking water. We used fractional and full factorial designs with center replicates to determine multifactor effects. We used chronic doses in experiments that varied in duration from 22 to 103 days. We tested for changes in thyroid hormone levels ability to make antibodies to foreign proteins and aggression in wild deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus and white outbred Swiss Webster mice Mus musculus ND4 strain. Endocrine immune and behavior changes occurred due to doses of mixtures but rarely due to single compounds at the same concentrations. Immune assay data suggest the possibility of seasonal effects at low doses. We present a multiple level model to help interpret the data in the context of human health and biological conservation concerns. We discuss six testing deficiencies of currently registered pesticides and suggest areas of human health concerns if present trends in pesticide use continue. 2038:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Existing and emerging pathogens pose unusual challenges for conservation because of their potential to drive rapid changes in the numerical abundance and genetic composition of wild host populations. An increasing number of studies indicate that host genetic diversity plays an important role in buffering populations against widespread epidemics and that parasites represent powerful selective agents in natural populations. The observation that infectious diseases might be both mitigated by and rapidly change the genetic composition of host populations gives new significance to the role of host genetic diversity in species conservation. Less clear is the role that pathogen evolutionary change plays in the emergence and spread of new diseases but recent examples indicate that humans might be selecting unknowingly for rapid changes in pathogen biology through habitat fragmentation climate shifts and environmental pollution. Although the risks they pose to endangered species are apparent pathogens and other natural enemies can be a driving force behind species and genetic diversity in natural populations and preserving interacting networks of coevolving populations should enable hosts to respond better to future disease threats. 2044:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Historically the role of parasites in ecosystem functioning has been considered trivial because a cursory examination reveals that their relative biomass is low compared with that of other trophic groups. However there is increasing evidence that parasite mediated effects could be significant: they shape host population dynamics alter interspecific competition influence energy flow and appear to be important drivers of biodiversity. Indeed they influence a range of ecosystem functions and have a major effect on the structure of some food webs. Here we consider the bottom up and top down processes of how parasitism influences ecosystem functioning and show that there is evidence that parasites are important for biodiversity and production; thus we consider a healthy system to be one that is rich in parasite species. 2071:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, West Nile Virus has spread more rapidly than expected in the Western Hemisphere. We tested Culex mosquitoes and long distance migratory birds as potential agents of spread for the virus using a series of techniques as follows. (1) Mosquito vector distributions were modeled using an ecological niche modeling approach (GARP) to produce a map of suitability of the landscape for mosquito transmission of the virus. (2) Simulations of spread were developed with an algorithm originally developed for modeling the spread of wildfires (EMBYR) seeding an initial presence of the virus in the New York City area. (3) Alternative spread scenarios were developed as (a) just mosquitoes as movement agents (spread simulation seeded once at New York City and allowed to spread across the mosquito suitability surface) versus (b) spread via mosquitoes on local scales in tandem with long distance colonization with migratory birds as movement agents (spread simulation seeded once at New York City and again at sites sampled from the winter destinations of birds breeding in southeastern New York State). The first scenario (mosquitoes only) did not coincide with observed patterns of spread whereas the second (mosquitoes and migratory birds) coincided closely suggesting that observed patterns of spread are best explained with migratory birds as critical long distance transport agents; the virus in regions to which it is transported by migratory birds then is transmitted enzootically via mosquitoes. Similar simulations of spread were used to predict extensions of the virus in the Western Hemisphere in coming years. 231:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,287:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We cannot confine ourselves to the so called   natural   entities and ignore the processes and expressions of vegetation now so abundantly provided by man. Such a course is not scientifically sound because scientific analysis must penetrate beneath the forms of the   natural   entities and it is not practically useful because ecology must be applied to conditions brought about by human activity. The   natural   entities and the anthropogenic derivates alike must be analyzed in terms of the most appropriate concepts we can find. 293:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The past five years have seen the arrival and extremely rapid expansion of West Nile virus (WNV) in the Western Hemisphere. The rapid sweep across North America has permitted little time for developing knowledge of the viruss potential impacts on wildlife in the New World. Given this information gap we here summarize for the ornithological community what is known or can be anticipated for WNVs effect on bird communities in coming years. Our particular focus is on impacts of WNV on the conservation status of birds the principal vertebrate reservoir for the virus. 295:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,316:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,356:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,402:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Infectious disease can be a concern for several aspects of conservation biology such as determining threats to species estimating population viability and designing reserves captive breeding and recovery programs. Several measures are useful for describing infectious diseases in host populations but it is not straightforward to determine the degree to which a particular disease may affect a host population. The most basic epidemiological theory suggests that populations should be least subject to host specific infectious disease when they are at low abundance ( paradoxically the state at which they are in most need of conservation action). There are important exceptions however such as when a reservoir host exists or when Allee or stochastic effects occur. Several of the key threats to biodiversity habitat alteration introduced species pollution resource exploitation and climate change can facilitate and or impair transmission of infectious disease. Common management tools such as population viability analysis rarely address infectious disease explicitly. We suggest that such an inclusion is both possible and warranted. Considerations of infectious disease may influence the way we determine whether a species is in need of protection and how we might design reserves and captive breeding programs. Examples from the literature suggest that (1) introduced pathogens can make abundant species rare and (2) diseases of domestic animals can dramatically affect rare species. For both scenarios conditions that cause stress or reduce genetic variation may increase susceptibility to disease whereas crowding and cross species contact can increase transmission. Southern sea otters ( Enhydra lutris nereis ) make an interesting case study for consideration of the intersection of epidemiology and conservation because disease may be an important factor limiting the growth of otter populations. We conclude that pathogens are of increasing concern for conservation. Because many newly emerging pathogen dynamics often do not conform to the simplifying assumptions used in classic epidemiology a detailed understanding of pathogen life history will illuminate the intersection of epidemiology and conservation theory. 409:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Parasite driven declines in wildlife have become increasingly common and can pose significant risks to natural populations. We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions. The majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals. Parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species including domesticated animals. Counter to our predictions parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes. Mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies. Our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals. In addition our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite mediated declines thus efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk. 41:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Alternative explanations for disease and other population cycles typically include extrinsic environmental drivers such as climate variability and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics resulting from feedbacks within the system such as species interactions and density dependence. Because these different factors can interact in nonlinear systems and can give rise to oscillations whose frequencies differ from those of extrinsic drivers it is difficult to identify their respective contributions from temporal population patterns. In the case of disease immunity is an important intrinsic factor. However for many diseases such as cholera for which immunity is temporary the duration and decay pattern of immunity is not well known. We present a nonlinear time series model with two related objectives: the reconstruction of immunity patterns from data on cases and population sizes and the identification of the respective roles of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in the dynamics. Extrinsic factors here include both seasonality and long term changes or interannual variability in forcing. Results with simulated data show that this semiparametric method successfully recovers the decay of immunity and identifies the origin of interannual variability. An application to historical cholera data indicates that temporary immunity can be long lasting and decays in approximately 9 yr. Extrinsic forcing of transmissibility is identified to have a strong seasonal component along with a long term decrease. Furthermore noise appears to sustain the multiple frequencies in the long term dynamics. Similar semiparametric models should apply to population data other than for disease. 421:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,463:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Individuals tend to interact more strongly with nearby individuals or within particular social groups. Recent theoretical advances have demonstrated that these within population relationships can have fundamental implications for ecological and evolutionary dynamics 1 11 . In particular contact networks are crucial to the spread 12 14 and evolution 8 9 11 15 of disease. However the theory remains largely untested experimentally 16 . Here we manipulate habitat viscosity and thereby the frequency of local interactions in an insect pathogen model system in which the virus had previously been shown to have little effect on host population dynamics 16 17 . At high viscosity the pathogen caused the collapse of dominant and otherwise stable host generation cycles. Modeling shows that this collapse can be explained by an increase in the frequency of intracohort interactions relative to intercohort interactions leading to more disease transmission. Our work emphasizes that spatial structure can subtly mediate intraspecific competition and the effects of natural enemies. A decrease in dispersal in a population may actually (sometimes rather counterintuitively) intensify the effects of parasites. Broadly because anthropological and environmental change often cause changes in population mixing our work highlights the potential for dramatic changes in the effects of parasites on host populations. 464:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,467:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,47:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,485:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Infectious disease risk is thought to increase in the tropics but little is known about latitudinal gradients of parasite diversity. We used a comparative data set encompassing 330 parasite species reported from 119 primate hosts to examine latitudinal gradients in the diversity of micro and macroparasites per primate host species. Analyses conducted with and without controlling for host phylogeny showed that parasite species richness increased closer to the equator for protozoan parasites but not for viruses or helminths. Relative to other major parasite groups protozoa reported from wild primates were transmitted disproportionately by arthropod vectors. Within the protozoa our results revealed that vector borne parasites showed a highly significant latitudinal gradient in species richness. This higher diversity of vector borne protozoa near the tropics could be influenced by a greater abundance or diversity of biting arthropods in the tropics or by climatic effects on vector behaviour and parasite development. Many vector borne diseases such as leishmaniasis trypanosomiasis and malaria pose risks to both humans and wildlife and nearly one third of the protozoan parasites from free living primates in our data set have been reported to infect humans. Because the geographical distribution and prevalence of many vector borne parasites are expected to increase because of global warming these results are important for predicting future parasite mediated threats to biodiversity and human health. 493:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Epidemiological models predict a positive relationship between host population density and abundance of macroparasites. Here I test these by a comparative study. I used data on communities of four groups of parasites inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of mammals nematodes of the orders Oxyurida. Ascarida. Enoplida and Spirurida respectively. The data came from 44 mammalian species and represent examination of 16 886 individual hosts. I studied average prevalence of all nematodes within an order in a host species. a measure of community level abundance and considered the potential confounding effects of host body weight fecundity age at maturity and diet. Host population density was positively correlated with parasite prevalence within the order Oxyurida where all species have direct life cycles. Considering the effects of other variables did not change this. This supports the assumption that parasite transmission rate generally is a positive function of host population density. It also strengthens the hypothesis that host densities generally act as important determinants of species richness among directly transmitted parasites and suggests that negative influence of such parasites on host population growth rate increase with increasing host population density among host species. Within the other three nematode orders. where a substantial number of the species have indirect life cycles no relationships between prevalence and host population density were seen. Again considering the effects of other variables did not affect this conclusion. This suggests that host population density is a poor predictor of species richness of indirectly transmitted parasites and that effects of such parasites on host population dynamics do not scale with host densities among species of hosts. 494:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Epidemiological theory predicts positive correlations between host population density or body mass and species richness among parasite communities. Here I test these predictions by a comparative study of communities of directly transmitted mammalian parasites gastrointestinal strongylid nematodes. I use data from 45 species of mammals representing examination of 17 200 individual hosts. The variable studied was the average number of gastrointestinal strongylid nematode species per host population and three different methods were used to obtain estimates of parasite species richness that are unbiased by number of host individuals examined. Analyses were done using the phylogenetically independent contrast method. Host population density and parasite species richness were strongly positively correlated when the effects of host body weight had been controlled for. Controlling for other variables did not change this and the relationship was found regardless of method used to correct for uneven sampling effort among host species. A positive relationship between parasite species richness and host body weight was also found but the effect of host densities had to be controlled for to see this. These relationships between host traits and species richness of directly transmitted parasites arc stronger than patterns found using data on indirectly transmitted mammalian parasites and suggests that links between host traits and parasite species richness are stronger than previously suggested. The results are consistent with parasite species richness being positively linked to pathogen transmission rates and reductions in transmission rates possibly increasing extinction probabilities in parasite populations. The results also suggest that parasites may exert a cost of increases in rate or population energy usage and thus show that pathogens may be important in generating independence between body mass and rate of population energy usage among host species. 500:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,501:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many of the most virulent emerging infectious diseases in humans AIDS and Ebola are zoonotic having shifted from wildlife populations. Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes which include chimpanzees and gorillas because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross species transmission but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate   hotspot   maps highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross species transmission events between wild primates due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives. These areas also are likely to sustain a novel epidemic due to their rapidly growing human populations close proximity to apes and population centers with high density and contact rates among individuals. 519:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,55:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Coevolutionary interactions such as those between hosts and parasites have been regarded as an underlying cause of evolutionary diversification but evidence from natural populations is limited. Among primates and other mammalian groups measures of host diversification rates vary widely among lineages but comparative studies have not yet identified a reliable explanation for this variation. In this study we used a comprehensive data set of disease causing organisms from free living primates to illustrate how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to examine mammalian lineage diversity in relation to parasite species richness. Our results provide evidence that the phylogenetic diversity of primate clades is correlated positively with the number of parasite species harbored by each host and that this pattern is largely independent of other host traits that have been shown to influence diversification rates and parasite species richness in primates. We investigated two possible mechanisms that could explain this association namely that parasites themselves drive host evolutionary diversification through processes linked with sexual selection and that host shifts or host sharing increases parasite species richness among diverse primate clades. Neither parasite species richness nor host diversification is related to measures of sexual selection in primates. Further we found only partial evidence that more rapidly diversifying host lineages produced increased opportunities for host sharing or host shifting by parasites through mechanisms involving species geographic range overlap. Thus our analyses provide evidence for an important link between the evolutionary diversification of primates and the richness of their parasite communities but other mechanisms particularly those related to reciprocal selection or coextinction of hosts and parasites require further investigation. 568:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Two ecological paradigms the trophic cascade and the host density threshold in disease interact in the kelp forest ecosystem to structure the community. To investigate what happens when a trophic cascade pushes a host population over a host threshold density I analyzed a 20 year data set of kelp forest communities at 16 sites in the region of the Channel Islands National Park California USA. Historically lobsters and perhaps other predators kept urchin populations at low levels and kelp forests developed a community level trophic cascade. In geographic areas where the main predators on urchins were fished urchin populations increased to the extent that they overgrazed algae and starvation eventually limited urchin population growth. Despite the limitation of urchin population size by food availability urchin densities at times well exceeded the host density threshold for epidemics. An urchin specific bacterial disease entered the region after 1992 and acted as a density dependent mortality source. Dense populations were more likely to experience epidemics and suffer higher mortality. Disease did not reduce the urchin population at a site to the density that predators previously did. Therefore disease did not fully replace predators in the trophic cascade. These results indicate how fishing top predators can indirectly favor disease transmission in prey populations. 590:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,60:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Drivers of disease cycles are poorly understood in marine ecosystems in spite of increasing outbreaks. We monitored a newly emerged fungal epizootic (aspergillosis) affecting sea fan corals (Gorgonia ventalina L.) in the Florida Keys to evaluate causes of its rise and fall over 6 years. Since August 1997 aspergillosis has nearly eradicated large sea fans at some sites. However sea fan densities have remained relatively constant due to episodic recruitment replacing large fans with small. Recruitment itself was affected by infection and occurred only when prevalence of disease was low. This impact on recruitment occurred because the largest potentially most fecund colonies had the highest prevalence of disease and the pathogen significantly suppressed reproduction of infected fans. Moreover high mortality among adults resulted in a demographic shift to smaller colonies. The most dramatic impact of aspergillosis was the Keys wide loss of  50 PeRcEnT of sea fan tissue from complete and partial mortality. Aspergillosis prevalence has declined steadily over the last 6 years and we consider the following hypotheses for decline of the epizootic: change in environment change in pathogen input and increase in host resistance. We conclude that increasing host resistance is the most likely driver of the decline. However a change in any of a number of factors for example recruitment of naive hosts rate of pathogen input or environmental conditions (water quality and temperature) is likely to promote reemergence of the epizootic. 635:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,656:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,65:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,662:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly,681:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Despite recent high impacts of disease in the ocean quantitative studies of diseases in natural marine populations lag far behind terrestrial systems. Transmission processes are poorly known in relatively open marine systems. We studied infection of sea fans Gorgonia ventalina by the fungus Aspergillus sydowii. To assess detectability and mechanisms of secondary transmission of the fungus we analyzed the spatial distribution of disease among the fans using Ripleys K as a measure of disease aggregation. Coral populations and disease were mapped at three reefs in the Florida Keys. Where disease prevalence was low the disease was distributed randomly among sea fans. This is consistent with disease transmission by input of infectious fungal material from terrestrial sources only. However where disease prevalence was high the disease was significantly. aggregated among sea fans at the 2 8 in scale consistent with secondary disease transmission. Such transmission could take place by physical contact between neighboring fans or infected fans might shed fungal material into the water column and other fans become infected by these fomites. Our results suggest that water borne transmission occurs but secondary transmission by physical contact is also likely. We cannot falsify the hypothesis that small scale local environmental conditions also contribute to disease aggregation. 68:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Literature data were collected on the floristic distribution and toxicity of phytochemicals to herbivores and on herbivore specialization in order to test phytochemical coevolution theory. The theory makes four predictions that can be tested with this information. Herbivores can adapt to novel more toxic chemicals by becoming specialists or they can become generalists but at the cost of lower feeding success on any particular host. Thus the first two predictions are as follows: herbivores should do better on chemicals that are present in their normal host and this pattern should be stronger for specialists than for generalists. The   escape and radiation   aspect of the theory holds that if a plant taxon with a novel defense chemical diversifies the chemical will become widespread. Eventually herbivores will adapt to and disarm it. So the third prediction is that more widespread chemicals are less toxic than more narrowly distributed ones. Because generalists should not do as well as specialists on chemicals disarmed by the latter the fourth prediction is that the third prediction should be more true for generalists than specialists and should depend on presence absence of the chemical in the normal host. Multiple regressions of toxicity ( herbivore mortality and final weight) on three predictor variables ( chemical presence absence in the normal host specialism and chemical floristic distribution) and relevant interactions were used to test these predictions. Chemical presence absence in the normal host the interaction between this variable and specialism and chemical floristic distribution had significant effects on both measures of toxicity supporting the first three predictions of the model. Support for the fourth prediction (a three way interaction among all predictor variables) was evident for final weight but not mortality perhaps because growth is more responsive to toxicity differences than survival. In short the phytochemistry literature provides broad support for the phytochemical coevolution model. 71:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many host pathogen interactions are embedded in a web of other interspecific interactions. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that reductions in predator abundance can indirectly lead to upsurges in infectious diseases harbored by prey populations. In this note we use simple models to show that in some circumstances predation can actually increase the equilibrial prevalence of infection in a host where prevalence is defined as the fraction of host population that is infected. Our results show that there is no complete generalization possible about how shifts in predation pressure translate into shifts in infection levels without some understanding of host population regulation and the role of acquired immunity. Our results further highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of nonregulatory pathogens in reservoir host populations and the understudied effects of demographic costs incurred by individuals that survive infection and develop acquired immunity. 72:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many insects are attacked by internal parasitoids against which they mount a largely cellular immunological defense. The resistance of a host and the virulence of a parasitoid determine which species survives after parasitism. Drosophila is parasitized by several hymenopterous parasitoids especially those in the genera Asobara and Leptopilina. Geographic patterns have been found in parasitoid virulence and host resistance the dearest of which is a dine in Asobara tabida virulence from the north (low) to the south thigh) of Europe. Drosophila melanogaster resistance is highest in central southern Europe and lower elsewhere. We review and interpret these patterns in the light of recent experimental and theoretical studies of the evolution and coevolution of these traits. We find no evidence for genotype specific virulence and defense which makes   Red Queen   type coevolution unlikely. The most important explanation for the patterns is geographic differences in host parasitoid community structure. Asobara tabida virulence is positively correlated with the resistance of its main hosts and there is more limited evidence that D. melanogaster resistance is influenced by the virulence of its parasitoids. We critically appraise whether the evidence available so far supports a coevolutionary explanation for the levels of these trails. 735:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Population cycles have been remarkably resistant to explanation in part because crucial experiments are rarely possible on appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Here we show how new approaches to nonlinear time series analysis can distinguish between competing hypotheses for population cycles of larch budmoth in the Swiss Alps: delayed effects of budmoth density on food quality and budmoth parasitoid interactions. We re examined data on budmoth density plant quality and parasitism rates. Our results suggest that the effect of plant quality on budmoth density is weak. By contrast a simple model of budmoth parasitoid interaction accounts for 90 PeRcEnT of the variance in budmoth population growth rates. Thus contrary to previous studies we find that parasitoid budmoth interaction appears to be the dominant factor driving the budmoth cycle. 811:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Results in Rohani . are not relevant to the conclusions in Murdoch . Resource driven single generation cycles (SGCs) in lab and model host parasitoid populations discussed by these authors are not examples of the consumer driven SGCs of Murdoch . Their models cannot produce consumer SGCs. SINGLE SPECIES L I K E CONSUMER (PARASITOID) CYCLES Murdoch . (2002) concerns cycles (henceforth consumer or parasitoid cycles) driven by competitive interactions between different aged cohorts of a consumer population with a period determined by consumer development time TP (subscripted for parasitoid). These are either single generation cycles (SGCs) with period between TP and 2TP or delayed feedback cycles (DFCs) with period at least 2TP. They have been found in two predator prey models and a parasitoid host gain model. They have two prerequisites. (1) There is roughly constant recruitment to the resource population. This suppresses inherent long period specialist consumer resource cycles and decouples the consumer resource interaction allowing the consumer to behave as if it were a single population receiving a constant food supply. Constant recruitment in the predator prey models comes from a prey refuge and in the parasitoid host model from a roughly constant long lived adult host population. (2) There is competition between different ages or stages in the consumer population. Delayed competition yields DFCs; absence of delay gives SGCs. In the predator prey models SGCs arise because young predators (fish Daphnia) are better competitors than adults: until it matures and reproduces each dominant cohort of young predators suppresses the resource (zooplankton algae) below the level required for successful reproduction. In the parasitoid host model parasitoid SGCs cannot occur if as in almost all parasitoids TP is less than host development time TH. Instead parasitoid cycles are DFCs with period approximately 2TP TH. Requirements for parasitoid SGCs include: the host has young and old immatures; the parasitoid attacks both but gains more from older hosts (creates inter cohort competition); and TP   TH (Table 1). SGCs arise because a dominant adult parasitoid cohort suppresses all host stages until its offspring mature. They thus require host stagestructure. HOST SGCs IN LABORATORY POPULATIONS In Plodia lab populations without parasitoids each cycle is caused by a dominant cohort of larvae that suppresses survival of all existing cohorts (including via cannibalism of eggs and small larvae). The immediate successor cohort becomes the next dominant one. The period is over 40 days; Plodia development time TH is 36.3 days. When the parasitoid Venturia is added these host SGCs persist and no parasitoid SGCs appear. Cycle period ( 40 days) is little changed and the mechanism driving the cycle remains asymmetrical interactions between different host stages which create pulses of host recruitment. Venturia TP is 20 days; the cycles are self evidently not parasitoid SGCs. They are not induced by age dependent interactions in the parasitoid. Such host parasitoid systems are unlikely to generate parasitoid SGCs. (a) The invulnerable Plodia adult is short lived (5.5 days). This favours pulsed host recruitment the basis of host SGCs but antagonistic to parasitoid SGCs; (b) there is no inter cohort parasitoid competition; and (c) since TP   TH any parasitoid cycles would be DFCs with period approximately 2TP TH (here about 80 days). ROHANI ET A L . MODELS The Rohani . models lack the prerequisites for parasitoid SGCs and do not produce them. They also assume pseudointerference among searching parasitoids which would suppress parasitoid SGCs if they were possible: adding pseudointerference suppresses parasitoid SGCs and DFCs in the gain parasitoid host model. Simulation results supporting this conclusion and those to follow are given on the Ecology Letters web site. The one host (Plodia) model without Venturia shows host SGCs (usually damped) with period 37 days very close to Plodia development time TH. They are induced by interstage competition. With Venturia present host SGCs with almost exactly the same period (36.5 days) dominate dynamics in the blue regions of Rohani . Venturia merely deepens the host nadir and narrows the peak. These are still host SGCs not parasitoid SGCs or DFCs. The period is 1.8TP; parasitoids in each peak are not offspring or F2 of those in the previous peak; age dependent parasitoid interactions are not in the model and do not drive the cycles. Host SGCs persist at high parasitoid attack rate because the skewed (k 1) negative binomial distribution of attacks causes within adult parasitoid density dependence (pseudointerference): parasitoid efficiency decreases as parasitoid density increases; parasitoid host cycles are suppressed and host SGCs appear. Host SGCs require short lived adults (which tends to produce cycles) and TP approximately 0.5TH (which reinforces that tendency) features of the Rohani . model. The two host model also lacks a mechanism to produce and has pseudointerference that would suppress parasitoid SGCs. In the blue regions of Rohani . (1) Plodia goes extinct in most of the parameter space and (2) the cycles are Ephestia half generation cycles which the parasitoid simply tracks. (Ephestia alone shows transient SGCs then damped half generation cycles; on half generation cycles). The MGCs in both models are a mixture of long period parasitoid host cycles and short period host cycles. In the MGCs of the Plodia Venturia model periods of extremely scarce parasitoids and dense hosts undergoing damped SGCs are interrupted by brief parasitoid eruptions. A simpler Plodia Venturia model has similar dynamics which may be general. The Ephestia Venturia version mainly shows the transient damped host SGCs. The Venturia two hosts version behaves similarly to the one host models. The two host SGCs are initially synchronous; each host SGC is reinforced; and the more abundant total hosts induces larger amplitude and longer period parasitoid host cycles. Interestingly the contrast above between Plodia extinction at low values of a2 and three species persistence in the MGC region shows that increased attack rate on older larvae causes coexistence of the two hosts in the face of apparent competition. GENERALITY Murdoch . claim that single species like cycles should be seen in generalist consumers because inter alia the recruitment rate of their combined resource species is likely to be independent of the abundance of the consumer or any one resource species. Consumer SGCs or DFCs in specialists would not refute this claim: they are expected when the conditions in Table 1 (defined by three specialist consumer resource models) are met. Murdoch . found 3 examples. A compelling counter example would be a generalist consumer with inter cohort competition and appropriate resource recruitment which nevertheless shows consumer resource cycles. Such a species should not be a de facto specialist in the population studied or the resource in a specialized consumer resource interaction. Murdoch . found two apparently generalist species carabid beetles that cycled with marginally long periods and these merit additional attention. 836:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Epidemics of marine pathogens can spread at extremely rapid rates. For example herpes virus spread through pilchard populations in Australia at a rate in excess of 10 000 km year( 1) and morbillivirus infections in seals and dolphins have spread at more than 3000 km year( 1). In terrestrial environments only the epidemics of myxomatosis and calicivirus in Australian rabbits and West Nile Virus in birds in North America have rates of spread in excess of 1000 km year( 1). The rapid rates of spread of these epidemics has been attributed to flying insect vectors but flying vectors have not been proposed for any marine pathogen. The most likely explanation for the relatively rapid spread of marine pathogens is the lack of barriers to dispersal in some parts of the ocean and the potential for long term survival of pathogens outside the host. These findings caution that pathogens may pose a particularly severe problem in the ocean. There is a need to develop epidemic models capable of generating these high rates of spread and obtain more estimates of disease spread rate. 849:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Many pathogens and parasites attack multiple host species so their ability to invade a host community can depend on host community composition. We present a graphical isocline framework for studying disease establishment in systems with two host species based on treating host species as resources. The isocline approach provides a natural generalization to multi host systems of two related concepts in disease ecology the basic reproductive rate of a parasite and threshold host density. Qualitative isocline shape characterizes the threshold community configurations that permit parasite establishment. In general isocline shape reflects the relative forces of inter and intraspecific transmission of shared parasites. We discuss the qualitative implications of parasite isocline shape for issues of mounting concern in conservation ecology. 85:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Some hosts harbor diverse parasite communities whereas others are relatively parasite free. Many factors have been proposed to account for patterns of parasite species richness but few studies have investigated competing hypotheses among multiple parasite communities in the same host clade. We used a comparative data set of 941 host parasite combinations representing 101 anthropoid primate species and 231 parasite taxa to test the relative importance of four sets of variables that have been proposed as determinants of parasite community diversity in primates: host body mass and life history social contact and population density diet and habitat diversity. We defined parasites broadly to include not only parasitic helminths and arthropods but also viruses bacteria fungi and protozoa and we controlled for effects of uneven sampling effort on per host measures of parasite diversity. In nonphylogenetic tests body mass was correlated with total parasite diversity and the diversity of helminths and viruses. When phylogeny was taken into account however body mass became nonsignificant. Host population density a key determinant of parasite spread in many epidemiological models was associated consistently with total parasite species richness and the diversity of helminths protozoa and viruses tested separately. Geographic range size and day range length explained significant variation in the diversity of viruses. 879:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Seasonal variations in temperature rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of the best studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host pathogen interactions including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases and that population level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite host systems operate how and when parasite control measures should be applied and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally by focusing on well studied examples of infectious diseases we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions. 893:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, The ecology of mosquito vectors and malaria parasites affect the incidence seasonal transmission and geographical range of malaria. Most malaria models to date assume constant or linear responses of mosquito and parasite life history traits to temperature predicting optimal transmission at 31 degrees C. These models are at odds with field observations of transmission dating back nearly a century. We build a model with more realistic ecological assumptions about the thermal physiology of insects. Our model which includes empirically derived nonlinear thermal responses predicts optimal malaria transmission at 25 degrees C (6 degrees C lower than previous models). Moreover the model predicts that transmission decreases dramatically at temperatures   28 degrees C altering predictions about how climate change will affect malaria. A large data set on malaria transmission risk in Africa validates both the 25 degrees C optimum and the decline above 28 degrees C. Using these more accurate nonlinear thermal response models will aid in understanding the effects of current and future temperature regimes on disease transmission. 919:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We modelled how stress affects the population dynamics of infectious disease. We were specifically concerned with stress that increased susceptibility of uninfected hosts when exposed to infection. If such stresses also reduced resources fecundity and or survivorship there was a reduction in the host carrying capacity. This lowered the contact between infected and uninfected hosts thereby decreasing transmission. In addition stress that increased parasite mortality decreased disease. The opposing effects of stress on disease dynamics made it difficult to predict the response of disease to environmental stress. We found analytical solutions with negative positive convex and concave associations between disease and stress. Numerical simulations with randomly generated parameter values suggested that the impact of host specific diseases generally declined with stress while the impact of non specific (or open) diseases increased with stress. These results help clarify predictions about the interaction between environmental stress and disease in natural populations. 961:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, We used ecologic niche modeling of outbreaks and sporadic cases of filovirus associated hemorrhagic fever (HF) to provide a large scale perspective on the geographic and ecologic distributions of Ebola and Marburg viruses. We predicted that filovirus would occur across the Afrotropics: Ebola HF in the humid rain forests of central and western Africa and Marburg HF in the drier and more open areas of central and eastern Africa. Most of the predicted geographic extent of Ebola HF appear to have been observed; Marburg HF has the potential to occur farther south and east. Ecologic conditions appropriate for Ebola HF are also present in Southeast Asia and the Philippines where Ebola Reston is hypothesized to be distributed. This first large scale ecologic analysis provides a framework for a more informed search for taxa that could constitute the natural reservoir for this virus family. 976:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, An epidemiological model was developed for rabies linking the risk of disease in a secondary species (cats) to the temporal dynamics of disease in a wildlife reservoir (raccoons). Data were obtained from cats raccoons and skunks tested for rabies in the northeastern United States during 1992 2000. An epizootic algorithm defined a time series of successive intervals of epizootic and inter epizootic raccoon rabies. The odds of diagnosing a rabid cat during the first epizootic of raccoon rabies was 12 times greater than for the period prior to epizootic emergence. After the first raccoon epizootic the risk for cat rabies remained elevated at levels six to seven fold above baseline. Increased monthly counts of rabid raccoons and skunks and decreasing human population density increased the probability of cat rabies in most models. Forecasting of the public health and veterinary burden of rabies and assessing the economics of control programmes requires linking outcomes to dynamic but predictable changes in the temporal evolution of rabies epizootics. 980:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Anti predator behavior can alter the dynamics of prey populations but little is known about the rate at which anti predator behavior is lost from prey populations following predator removal. The Channel Islands differ in whether they have historically contained a top predator the Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis) in evolutionary time (approximately 6200 10 000 yr). On a historically fox containing island and two historically fox free islands in 2007 I deployed live traps that contained olfactory cues of fox predators (fox feces) olfactory cues of an herbivore (horse feces) or a no feces control. Due to a captive breeding program foxes on the historically fox containing island were effectively removed from 1998 to 2004. Rodents from one of the historically fox free islands did not respond to fox cues whereas rodents on the historically fox containing island were more likely to be captured in a control trap and less likely to be captured in a fox cue trap. Results from the other historically fox free island that experienced a recent population bottleneck and period of captive rearing exhibited a preference for horse scented traps. These results suggest that on islands where foxes are the primary predators anti predator behavior in response to olfactory cues is not likely to be rapidly lost by short term removals of foxes although the nature of anti predator behavior may depend upon founder events and recent population dynamics  population bottlenecks or several generations in captivity). 997:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529, Natural populations of primates host an amazing diversity of parasites and infectious diseases many of which are endemic in natural populations. These include a tremendous variety of intestinal nematodes protozoa and bacteria sexually transmitted viruses such as simian immunodeficiency virus and vector borne diseases such as malaria and yellow fever. More recently infectious disease epidemics have become a major conservation concern with outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever and anthrax decimating populations of African apes possibly through spillover from unknown reservoir hosts and domesticated animals. Primates themselves can serve as sources of new emerging diseases in humans. Finally parasites have driven the evolution of a wide variety of behaviors observed in primates ranging from the consumption of medicinal plants to fly swatting and other behaviors aimed at reducing contact with bot flies and insect vectors of disease. Ecological and evolutionary pressures operating on primate mating and social systems could also arise from processes driven by infectious diseases. Understanding the diversity spread and evolution of parasites in wild primates is therefore important for a wide variety of topics involving primate conservation behavioral ecology and human health. The first step in understanding the role of parasites in primate socioecology and conservation is to improve our knowledge of primate parasites and their occurrence in natural populations. Which parasites are found in wild primates and what percentage of any given population is infected with different parasites? How do parasite richness and infection rates correlate with primate traits such as group size diet or body mass? Which parasites do wild primates share with humans and domesticated animals and do particular host traits such as habitat use facilitate the sharing of parasites among host species? Are parasites going extinct as their primate host populations decline? If so would saving particular parasites help or harm their threatened hosts? To begin addressing these questions we have compiled a comprehensive database on the parasites of free living primates and other mammals. The primate component of this Global Mammal Parasite Database is now freely available for others to access via the World Wide Web. Records in the GMPD are based primarily on reports of parasites and pathogens from the published literature. The database will be regularly updated as new information is published or uncovered in our ongoing literature searches. The information provided covers all major groups of micro and macro parasites found in wild primates including helminths protozoa viruses bacteria arthropods and fungi. In collating this database we searched the literature for reports of parasites from wild primate populations by using primate species Latin binomials as search keywords in online reference databases such as Biological Abstracts AGRICOLA Medline PrimateLit and Web of Science. We also searched by primate genus name following the taxonomic scheme of Corbet and Hill as well as by common taxonomic variants. For each parasite reported from a wild primate population we recorded information on host species parasite species and sampling locality. The first version of the dataset placed online includes 2 462 lines of data each line capturing a record of a parasite species reported from a wild host population. This database includes information on 119 primate species and over 400 parasite species. We updated parasite species names based on current online databases. Parasite nomenclature for viruses followed the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses database which is available online. Nomenclature for other parasite species followed the taxonomic guidelines published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. On the GMPD search screen users can identify search terms that specify parasite name host name parasite type (using the taxonomic groups listed above) or primate lineage (prosimians New World monkeys Old World monkeys and apes). The input format is set up to search for character strings within words so that the full parasite or host species name need not be entered. This is important because in some cases especially with the older literature it was impossible to identify hosts or parasites below the genus level. Users can also specify whether records of zero prevalence are provided in which investigators searched for a parasite but failed to find it. Output includes host parasite species combinations along with information on the prevalence of infection the location where sampling took place the numbers of animals sampled and full reference information. The data are presented in rows and columns in the web browser window which can easily be copied into a spreadsheet program. Currently we are developing a protocol that will allow users to submit new information or make corrections to the database; for now new submissions and comments can be sent to us via an e mail link on the GMPD search page. We request that users cite this publication in studies that use information derived from GMPD Database. Previous versions of this database have been used to investigate parasite species richness in primates host diversification in relation to parasite diversity prevalence in threatened primates and associations between transmission mode and host specificity in parasites of primates. Additional databases on carnivores ungulates and squirrels will be available through the GMPD in the future allowing comparisons of disease risk among major mammalian orders as well as providing a better understanding of overlap in the parasite communities of mammals. A general overview of parasites in mammalian sociality and conservation can be found in Altizer and coworkers and Nunn and Altizer.
