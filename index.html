		<h1>Visualizing NCEAS Research Projects and Publications</h1>
		<p class="important">
			<img src="img/NCEAS-stacked-logo-200px.png" />
			In the past two decades, researchers at NCEAS have produced over 2200 peer-reviewed publications as part of nearly 500 projects. These products include groundbreaking innovations in synthesis science and encompass a broad range of topics, from the ecological effects of climate change to foundational concepts in evolution and community ecology.  Over time, the scope of research at NCEAS has continued to expand to encompass conservation and resource management challenges and critical issues at the nexus of nature conservation and human well-being. Given the volume and range of NCEAS research over the past 20 years, NCEAS has sought to create new tools to help understand and communicate both the scope and impact of our collective work. Through this process, sixteen themes have emerged that best describe NCEAS papers and projects.
		</p>
		<h4 class="title">How to use</h4> 
		<p class="small">The sixteen themes of NCEAS' research are represented as arcs on the outer circle. The colored circles and squares represent NCEAS projects and products and their relationships to the research themes.
			<ul class="small"><li>Click on the <b>outer circle</b> to get a closer look at a theme and see which NCEAS projects and products most closely relate to it.</li><li><b>Circles</b> represent NCEAS research projects or Working Groups.</li><li><b>Squares</b> indicate individual NCEAS products (e.g. articles, reviews).</li><li><b>Color</b> indicates the topic to which the circle or square is most closely related.</li><li><b>Brightness</b> when a theme is chosen shows how closely related the product or project is to that topic.</li><li><b>Clusters</b> indicate projects and products that are most similar to each other at a finer scale.</li></ul></p>
		<h4 class="title">Methodology</h4>
		<p class="smaller"><em>Beginning in 2012, NCEAS Postdoctoral Associate (now Research Associate) Stacy Rebich Hespanha used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify these sixteen emergent subject areas that describe the main themes addressed in the titles, abstracts, and keywords of NCEAS papers and projects, as well as 87 finer-scale topics that define the clusters in this visualization. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a probabilistic approach to discovering topics based on co-occurrence of terms, was first described in <a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/blei03a.html" target="_blank"> Blei, Ng &amp; Jordan, 2003</a>. A more general overview of topic modeling approaches by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2133806.2133826" target="_blank">David Blei (2012)</a> provides a good introduction. The location of the points was determined through the Hellinger distance and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which pulls each point together with its nearest neighbors in 2D space, but doesn't necessarily push dissimilar documents apart. t-SNE was described by <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf" target="_blank">van der Maarten and Hinton (2008)</a>.</em></em></p>
		<p class="smaller">
			<em>Based on these data, Stacy and NCEAS software designer Lauren Walker sketched out a design for a web-based interactive visualization tool for browsing and exploring  the entire body of work at NCEAS. During the first <a href="http://nceas.github.io/open-science-codefest/" target="_blank">Open Science Codefest</a> in 2014, informatics experts contributed to the development of this visualization. Lauren has since continued development of the project, resulting in this interactive publication browser.</em></p>
