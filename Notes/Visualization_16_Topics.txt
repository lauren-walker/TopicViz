Introduction*	What it is: A visualization of the 500+ projects and 2000+ products that have come out of NCEAS over the past 20 years*	How it works: Explain how the user should interact with the visualization. What are the topics? What does the color of the dot mean? What does the opacity mean?*	How it was created: Created by topic modeling algorithm that used titles and abstracts. Visualization was started at open science codefest (plug open science/link to repository)Topic 1: Informatics, Modeling & AnalyticsDescription:Topic 2: Biodiversity Conservation & ManagementDescription:Topic 3: Ecosystem ServicesDescription: Evaluating the benefits people obtain from ecosystemsScience Highlights: https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/science/servicesTopic 4: Marine Ecology and Resources ManagementDescription:Science Highlights: https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/science/marineTopic 5: Community EcologyDescription:Topic 6: Ecological Effects of Climate ChangeDescription: Effects of climate change on organisms and the feedback from ecosystems to the climateScience Highlights: https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/science/climateTopic 7: Landscape EcologyDescription:Topic 8: Population DynamicsDescription:Topic 9: BiogeographyDescription:Topic 10: Nutrient Cycling and ProductivityDescription:Topic 11: Foodweb EcologyDescription:Topic 12: PaleoecologyDescription:Topic 13: EvolutionDescription:Topic 14: Forest EcologyDescription:Topic 15: Disturbances and Invasive SpeciesDescription:Topic 16: Infectious DiseaseDescription: Interactions between disease, humans, and their environmentsScience Highlights: https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/science/diseaseNOTE: These urls may change to:https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/science-highlights?id=services-highlightsonce the side nav functionality is working
