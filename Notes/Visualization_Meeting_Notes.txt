Notes from Visualization Meeting Post Codefest-	opacity of dots needs to be darker-	show time series – turn bar in donut into time series bar graph-	integrating subcategories (100 topics) – smaller boxes in the donut-	change depth of the arcs to reflect the # of dots associated with that category-	have a different symbol for products and projects-	is there a way to show which publications came out of a project without it being too confusing?-	Is there a meaningful (and not potentially hurtful) way to display citation data?-	Need a visualization name!-	Publications all have a DOI number – links to publications can be easily created by pulling DOI number from database and adding dx.doi.org in front of it – need to find a way to dynamically create formatted citations, either using a DOI resolver or pulling info from the NCEAS database-	Features to Add:o	Search by author/PIo	Filter by date (slider that allows you to choose a date range)o	Search for specific product or projecto	Side div with intro message explaining what the visualization is and how it works. When you click on one of the 16 topics in the donut, the div content changes to show information about the topic.o	Tweet button that preserves the visualization in its current stateo	Random button that spins the circle and lands on one product or project-	Information to Include for Each of the 16 Topics in the Side Div:o	Topic Nameo	Topic Description (abbreviated description shows up in tool tip on hover)o	Link to science highlights page (if it exists)o	Link to a list of all publications and products that were assigned to that topic (these pages should be created dynamically from database)-	Individual Dot Interactivityo	Hover – tooltip that has 1) citation nicely formatted with title easy to read (should be created dynamically) 2) link to science highlight specific accordion if it exists 3) link to publication (should open in a new tab so it doesn’t take the user away from the nceas website entirely) OR link to the project page if the dot is a projecto	Click – tooltip locks in place so that you can easily click on the links. Something about the design should also change so the user can tell that the click was registered (tooltip border gets darker or it changes color or something) -	Updating dataseto	Should be done at least once/year to include new publications/projects as well as update citation informationo	Next pull from database for dataset update: December 31, 2014
